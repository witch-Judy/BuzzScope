There is a place to display the calculated value, called rasxod.

I wrote the following script:

Dim KCL, WT_2302, rasxod

Sub DataLink25_OnDataChange(val)

    KCL = val
    rasxod = HisoblaRasxod()

Sub DataLink26_OnDataChange(val)

    WT_2302 = val
    rasxod = HisoblaRasxod()

End Sub
' --------------------------------------
Function HisoblaRasxod()

    Dim natija

    If KCL = 20 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0032
    ElseIf KCL = 21 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0033
    ElseIf KCL = 22 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0035
    ElseIf KCL = 23 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0036
    ElseIf KCL = 24 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0037
    ElseIf KCL = 25 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0038
    ElseIf KCL = 26 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.004
    ElseIf KCL = 27 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0041
    ElseIf KCL = 28 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0042
    ElseIf KCL = 29 Then
        natija = WT_2302 * 0.0045

However, it does not work as expected.
Could you please help me understand what is wrong and how to fix it?

‚ÄúFailed to connect to configuration server.‚Äù

I‚Äôve already tried restarting the PC, but it still happens.
Could you please help me check what might be wrong?
Do I need to start any services manually or check any network settings?

Confirm your software version is 7.0.0; if it isnt, update to that version.
Open the Services console and check that ApacheFileSyncServer and VxEngine are running; if they aren't, start them manually
If those two services are missing, an antivirus tool may have removed them so you need to uninstall your antivirus tool. Reinstall the software to restore the services.
After reinstalling, if ApacheFileSyncServer still doesn't appear in the Services list, open a Command Prompt in C:\SOLISCADA\Apache24\bin and run: httpd.exe -k install -n ""ApacheFileSyncServer"" to install the service
Once installation succeeds, open Task Manager, right‚Äëclick cfgDown.exe, select End task, then verify whether the issue is resolved.","",""

Possible Causes:
1.The configuration service is not running.
2. The IP address of the operational node is unreachable.

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check if the configuration service is running: Look for the configuration service icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner of your screen). If it is running, proceed to step 3. If not, proceed to step 2.

2. Navigate to the installation directory of the software, locate the CfgDown file, right-click on it, and select ""Run as administrator"".

3. Open the Command Prompt (cmd) and ping the operational node's IP address to ensure it is online.

4. If the IP is unreachable, adjust your computer's network card settings to ensure the IP is active and enabled. This may involve connecting to a local network or device. Alternatively, you can set the IP of the subproject's data server group to 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

Important Note: Simply setting the IP address on the network card is not sufficient; the network card must be actively connected to a network or device for the IP to take effect. Otherwise, the SCADA software may not detect a valid IP address.","",""

If the problem persists after these checks, we would need you to provide a short screen video. It would be very helpful if the video could show:
1. The complete steps you take from logging in to accessing this specific command.
2. You entering the value ""1"" and confirming it.
3. The moment the system automatically reverts it back to ""0"".
