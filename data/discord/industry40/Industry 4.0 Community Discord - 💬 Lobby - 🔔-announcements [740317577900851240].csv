Questions:

**What is Digital Factory Mastermind Step 2?** 
Step 2 is a brand new class. It builds on the foundation that we all built in Step 1, But you do not need to Purchase Step 1 to get value from Step 2.

**If I purchased Step 1 do I need to purchase Step 2?**
If you want the content from Step 2 then **yes**. If you don't ever plan on integrating ERP into an IIoT infrastructure... or you don't have a pressing need for it right now, then save your money. You can always purchase the record later when  you do need it.

**What is the difference between Mastermind LIVE and Recording?**
Anyone who attends the LIVE Mastermind, will get the recording. We only do each LIVE training once, so it makes sense to attend for the LIVE Q&A portion. Especially if you are working on a project right now.

**What is the cost?**
The cost for Digital Mastermind Step 2 LIVE is $1997.
The cost if you want to wait and buy the recording is $997

**What is the Early Bird Discount?**
Purchase your Digital Factory Mastermind Step 2 LIVE tickets before 10/31 and save $1000. (Think of it like pre-order the recording and attend LIVE for free)

**How many seats will the LIVE Mastermind be limited to?
**In order to keep the LIVE Mastermind productive we are limiting down the number of LIVE attendees to just 15. 

**How many seats are sold already?
**5 of you guys & gals have already signed up! We are blown away!

**When is the training?**
The Step 2 Mastermind LIVE is on **Friday December, 4th 8:00 AM CST

**Is there a FREE 1-Year subscription to the Mentorship Program with Step 2?**
No. That was a bonus we only offered to the original group in Step 1. 

**Will I get a 30 Minute 1on1 call with Walker Reynolds if I purchase Step 2? Like was offered with Step 1?**
Again no. That was a exclusive bonus just for the original people to purchase Mastermind Step 1. We are no longer offering this. If you have not yet booked this! Please reach out to myself or Vaughn Turner and we will get you a link to schedule your call. We did not forget about that. (Many of you have done this already)","",""

There are still 3M or so Texans without power at any given time, about 1.2M of those in Dallas.  Our power infrastructure isn’t designed for a really cold temps — so our turbines are all frozen and our NG plants have frozen valves.  We are operating with peak demand and about 30% less generation than normal.  We’ve had single digit temps for 3 straight days, which has never happened before in DFW (last time we were in single digits was 1989, for 1 day).  Up until this week, we had only hit single digits 8 times in recorded history... the last 3 days its been continuous single digits and record breaking cold each day.  My power just came back on and I wanted to touch base with the community.  We still have teammates in DFW who have been without power for a day or two, continuous.  The cell networks are affected too, so most people don’t have any data access during the outages, which makes it impossible to do work or check messages until its your turn to have power.  Right now, its all about keeping our families warm and trying to get to Wednesday, when things should turn around.  I appreciate the well wishes and prayers for our team and for all Texans.","","👍 (3),🙏 (3)"

Hey @everyone! We've made some changes to the Discord server to continue to improve the experience, particularly to create a more personalized and streamlined experience for you all. 

Introducing Channels & Roles and Custom Channel Selection! 🎉

There is a new onboarding process for the Discord server, here's a quick overview of the new features:

Channels & Roles: As an existing member, you can head over to the ""Channels & Roles"" section at the top of the server navigation and identify yourself based on profession. This will help us foster more targeted conversations and networking opportunities within the community.

Custom Channel Selection: To make your experience even more tailored, you can now choose which channels you'd like to see based on your interests. Simply visit the ""Channels & Roles"" section, pick your topics of interest, and voilà - your server view will be customized! Alternatively, you can click on ""Browse Channels"" on the same screen and manually select the channels you'd like to view.

We've also been making updates to the channels and permissions. You may notice some channels go away, new ones added, or channels condensed. This is all serving to make the Discord server more easily navigated. The #🔔-announcements channel no longer allows messages in the channel to help declutter conversation. You can now right click on an announcement in this channel and create a thread to send messages (such as wishing someone a happy birthday!)

Please take a moment to explore the new features, and if you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, feel free to reach out to our mod team. We're always here to help!

Happy exploring, and as always, thank you for being part of our amazing community! 🌟","","👍 (15)"

🚨 Important Community Announcement 🚨
 
Hey everyone,
 
We believe in fostering an open, respectful, and inclusive community here at 4.0 Solutions. This space was created for the free exchange of ideas, methodologies, and even healthy debate—whether you're in agreement with us or challenging our approaches. We welcome all of it because that’s how we grow and improve together.
 
However, we must draw a clear line when it comes to personal attacks. Unfortunately, we’ve had an incident where a member engaged in ad hominem attacks and veiled sexual slurs towards another community member on our YouTube channel. This behavior is unacceptable and contrary to the values we hold true. As a result, we have made the decision to ban this individual from our community.
 
We want to emphasize that while we encourage and even embrace criticism, including critiques of Walker’s personality and character, we will not tolerate attacks on the people within our community. Our community is meant to be a safe space where everyone feels welcome to share their thoughts without fear of personal attacks.
 
Remember, it's through open communication and respectful discourse that the best ideas win. Let’s continue to uphold the values that make our community strong.
 
Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

You're running your HR like it's 2010 but expecting 2025 results. Keep doing that, and your business won't survive.

Struggling to attract skilled employees? Losing top talent to competitors? 

**The reality is:** your current hiring practices are failing. 🤦‍♂️ 

**Let's be honest:**

- How many of you easily attract top talent?
- How many have Gen Zers and Millennials eager to work for you?
- Few, if any. Most companies are using outdated strategies to recruit tomorrow's talent. It's time to stop patching a broken system.

**We've heard your concerns:**

- ""How does our organization change as we become more digitally focused?""
- ""What roles do we add?""
- ""How do we re-organize?""
- ""How do existing roles change?""
- ""How do we align IT practices with a workforce that expects accessible digital tools?""

After months of work, we've developed a solution.

🚀 **Announcing: The Employee of the Future Workshop** 🚀

**Who: **Manufacturing executives, HR leaders, plant managers, and operations professionals

**What:** A two-day virtual workshop equipping you with strategies to build a future-ready workforce

**When:** 🗓️ November 6th-7th, 2024

**Where:** Online—attend from anywhere!

This isn't just another workshop; it's a response to real challenges and a guide for real change.

🔧 Struggling with the ""Build vs. Buy"" MES Dilemma? Here’s How to Solve It Without Breaking the Bank.

In the early phases of digital transformation, building strong MES capabilities is critical to delivering fast time to value. But many manufacturers face the same tough question:

Do we buy an off-the-shelf MES solution, or do we build our own?

The reality is that off-the-shelf MES solutions often come with high costs, limited flexibility, and long implementation timelines. But what if there was a way to build your own MES system using an open IIoT platform, leveraging existing infrastructure for faster results and lower costs?

📢 Join our FREE MES Bootcamp Orientation on December 4th, 2024, at 12 PM CT
Led by Walker Reynolds and co-hosted by Zack Scriven this session will give you the foundational knowledge to confidently approach MES implementation and solve the build vs. buy dilemma with a cost-effective, scalable solution.

Who is this for?
✅ Existing students: Catch up on essential MES concepts and refresh your skills.

✅ New students: Get up to speed on the basics and learn how to kickstart your MES journey.

✅ Digital transformation leaders: Learn where to start when integrating MES into your transformation strategy.

In this free session, Walker will cover:
🛠️ Basic MES Capabilities – Learn the essential MES functions that drive efficiency:
 · Work orders: Streamline production and order management.
 · Scheduling: Optimize your manufacturing processes.
 · OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness): Maximize productivity.
 · Downtime tracking: Identify and reduce lost time.
 · Build vs. Buy: Get expert insights on how to decide which approach works best for your organization.

💡 Real-world MES strategies: Discover how to use open IIoT platforms, UNS architecture, and MQTT brokers to build your own MES system without the high cost of proprietary solutions.

Why attend this free session?
📚 Gain a solid foundation in MES: Ideal for beginners or those needing a refresher on MES basics.

🎓 Expert guidance: Walker and Zack will offer real-world, practical insights into solving your MES challenges.

🤝 Interactive Q&A: Ask questions in real-time and get personalized advice for your specific needs.

🔧 What’s next?
The 8-week MES Bootcamp Accelerator Program officially starts on January 7th, 2025, at 10 AM CT, led by Zack Scriven. This program is designed to help you implement and scale your own MES system through hands-on learning and weekly live coaching.

💥 Don’t miss out on this opportunity! Sign up for the free Foundation Session to kickstart your MES journey and take advantage of Early Bird Pricing for the full Bootcamp program.
