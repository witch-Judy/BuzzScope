@demetri3524 yes sir, I would -- unless the PLC supports store and forward over MQTT or DNP3 out of the box (think Opto 22 or Wago, for example).  The final architecture would depend on several variables but for any mission critical data, buffering and S&F is required in the architecture.  The beauty of edge driven and report by exception with S&F is that we  have a lot of options available.","","üëç (1)"

@plcmercenary Thank you for that!
@demetri3524  We're excited about 2 upcoming I/O modules for the EPIC (note this is ***preliminary*** information, subject to change, and this I4.0 Community Discord is hearing it first):
First, a power monitoring module potentially capable of ‚ÄãCAT III measurement of power on up to 3-phases for wye or delta configurations. Should be able to measure phase to phase voltage up to 600 VAC. Current measurement is expected to be performed using either 0.333V or 5A CTs. Cool, right?
Second, an EPIC module that is a chassis-mounted version of our first RIO I/O module; in other words, a 10-channel software configurable groov  EPIC I/O module (or card as you put it) that is essentially the same I/O footprint as RIO (as you know, RIO is a standalone Ethernet I/O module with Node-RED and MQTT Sparkplug B). So, imagine that flexibility on a single chassis.
*Note these are not for sale, and a release date is not yet available. *And hopefully I haven't broken any community rules by responding to the OP's question! üòÅ","","üíØ (4)"

@Ben Veenema Opto22 Groov Epic is really hard to beat for IIoT.  Depending on the complexity of your needs, EZAutomation EZRack is a great low cost option that has native MQTT integration but lacks the bells and whistles (which is why its low cost), Siemens also supports MQTT out of the box now (we are using a lot of S7 1200 with their MQTT blocks).  My personal opinion, Opto22 is the leader in I4.0 process control and its not even close, really.  @Benson Hougland can provide more info you need it but damn... they got the goods.","","üòã (4)"

I can also vouch for Red Lion¬¥s products. I have used their HMI (Graphite and CR series) and gateways (DA series and FlexEdge) in production environments.  What I love about Red Lion products are: free software, multiple protocol conversion, OPC UA capabilities, web server and viewer, good tech support, and MQTT connectors - including Sparkplug B.  I should also, note that defining UDTs or data structure is easy within the Crimson software. Also, their cellular offering makes it very easy to demo for customer.

For example, grab a DA o Flexedge, add cellular, then install Ignition with MQTT Distributor & Engine  (with 2 hour demo) in a Vultr Linux-based server, mock up some responsive displays in Perspective, and you have a relatively inexpensive (< $1200USD) way of demoing solutions to customers. Cellular is a great way to do an end-run on IT and build the business case for our OT friends in maintenance and operations. 

I do not understand why I do not hear/see more about their products in the I4.0 space.

If it leverages pub/sub part of OPC-UA standard, it is report by exception and will use MQTT, it is not stateful because state of the connection is not part of the OPC-UA standard (including pub/sub part of the standard).  It does not jump the hurdle on the size of the OPC-UA headers, eg. payload is exponentially larger than flat MQTT or Sparkplug MQTT as well as DNP3 or LWM2M.  OPC-UA also is not 'OPEN' in the traditional sense because so many parts of the standard are optional.  All that being said, this is a step in the right direction for hardware manufacturers and I would not deter them from taking this step.  Unfortunately, there is no doubt they will charge for this OPC Server because it will require far more work to develop than just adding in MQTT client support (which hardware manufacturers are able to include at no additional cost).  When its all said and done -- adding on board OPC servers is a good thing for process control and does little to add value for enterprise IIoT solutions.","","üëç (1),üíØ (1)"

I have a few questions in regards to shield termination, I have some experience with shield termination but still have lots to learn. So, any help would be appreciated.

Background information:
We are helping commission a dairy barn that has many VFDs connected to a controller with multiple 0-10Vdc outputs. Each 0-10Vdc output is going to approximately 10 VFDs. See the attached schematic for a simple illustration of the set up.

I was wondering what the best practice is for terminating the shield of the control wires going to VFDs, specifically when going through junction boxes. I have read that it is best to keep continuity and that the shield should be terminated on one end (signal source end). I have also read that it is best to terminate the shield on both ends. What is best?

Also, what is best practice for shield termination when branching off from the junction box to the VFD?

If you have any other feedback or recommendations, I am happy to hear.","",""

You need to use an active isolator/splitter, not passive.  Active Isolators can be AC or DC powered.  Another good isolator is made by PR Electronics, look up model 5104, which I believe can do either Volt or mA isolation.

Who is using OOP/OOIP?

I am transitioning from writing control systems using C/C++ and extensive OOP techniques to writing Control Systems using Industrial Controls IDE's (in this case Codesys) and finding it very frustrating. The things I am used to doing aren't working like encapsulating functionality in objects and sharing that functionality with controlled interfaces. 

I am looking for books, video, training and other resources for using well structured OOP techniques in PLCs.  I have found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1eGzBT5mQ&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=garyhartland and the corresponding project here: https://ooip-foundation.proboards.com/ and have signed up for this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/plc-object-oriented-programming-advanced-infastrucutre/

Should I even be bothering with OOP? My gut tells me hell yes and that OOP is a natural fit with IIoT but I'm open to the idea that it's not appropriate or too much trouble.","",""

The protocol is not efficient and not secure. MQTT can use encryption, is lightweight and projected for these cases when the connectivity might be breaking any time. You can also program these devices for a internal buffer, in case they are not connected to the cloud. And also, they usually allow you to install Linux and that potentially expands the horizon for you to do things like ML on the controller. Think of an Arduino, that is good for control but is shy and computing power. And a Raspberry Pi that is the opposite. Edge devices basically are both in a single box.","",""

What you mentioned makes a lot of sense, at least for now. These Edge devices are good if you have a different scenario like, one device per plant in one or several plants.

To train the model, you would typically use the cloud. Ex: you want to train a model to count and inspect parts for quality, using vision. You can train the model on the Cloud and once it is trained, to detect the pattern you no longer need a lot of processing power, but you do need minimal latency and cannot rely on the cloud. So if you have a PLC that can run TensorFlow, for example, it is the perfect scenario as there is no latency.

I can see that you can quickly hit a tipping point where all of the edge devices installed as IO collectively have more computing power than the PLC they are connected to.

"745009912160976977","marioishikawa","2020-10-30T20:11:16.1530000+08:00","In my opinion, there is still a need nowadays to keep things simple on the PLC side due to availability. So the PLC CPU is certainly very limited, but once it is started it is already running the control program in 100ms. Basically there is no software fault on the firmware to halt it. For critical mission, this is very important. When you go to Edge processing, you will need more things, and an Operating system such as Ubuntu will open a lot of doors. But if it crashes, it might stop your machine/process and take like one minute to go live again. But PC PLC is a topic since the 90s. Beckhoff is now working with PLCs that run over Windows, and they even made a partnership with Microsoft to have the Kernel modified (so they said in a conference I was attending). It certainly might be a move, but on the other hand, computers evolve so fast that there is no time for a technology to get mature to the point it will really be bug free and 100% availability. In 5 years they will have to repeat their hard work for new lines of processors and SOs, while if you want just to count pulses a $200 Siemens Logo will do the job pretty well just as it was already doing 15 years ago.

There exists a lot of hardware that is designed to be deployed in the field (e.g., rugged, hardened, din rail, 24vdc), but marketed as ""edge"".  The word ""edge"" has become somewhat synonymous with ""field"".  The name edge comes from edge-of-network.  A rack full of blade servers at a large manufacturing site is just as edge-of-network as an industrial PC in an asset's electrical panel.  The role of the edge here is to connect nodes into the broader digital ecosystem and, optionally, provide some local services (e.g., HMI, analytics).

You're definitely right.  It's often much more practical (and cost-effective) to leverage centralized software gateways rather than deploying tens, hundreds, or even thousands of industrial PCs on assets.  When a manufacturing site is sufficiently large and ""Industrie 3.0"" enough, it will have the infrastructure in place that makes this favorable.  However, not all industrial environments are like this.  Some are remote oil fields with bare bones infrastructure.  Some are plants with infrastructure but without a culture or useful IT personnel to make use of it.  These environments are where a low-cost edge device can make a ton of sense.  It's also a lot easier to sell an edge device than piece of software that requires an entire infrastructure (e.g., server, networking, maintenance).

I believe overtime we will likely see more intelligence on the asset level.  Either we will see more advanced PLCs or we will see some sort of industrial PC playing a supervisory role.  In addition to IIoT connectivity, they might be providing edge services (e.g., HMI, buffering, information models, remote access) that make the node itself more useful.  At the end of the day, the vast majority of transformation programs will involve brownfield sites.  This will pose constraints and will help mold the solution.","","üíØ (2),üëç (1)"

It's all but replaced analog input cards for us.  Those 8-port IP67 IO-Link masters work wonders in both brown- and green-field scenarios.  They save on cabinet space.  Flexible topology (e.g., daisy chain, ring).   Analog transducer for non-IOL devices.  IFM has a slick IOL LED stacklight with a buzzer.  Each port can be used for conventional DI/DO and can be expanded with hub devices.  Sensors can be whitelisted to specific port(s) and the configs are stored in the PLC.   I could go on and on.

Many assets in my industry vertical tend to be useless from a preventative maintenance standpoint.  When an asset does have sensors, they're typically digital/discrete.  That is, there are alarm levels programmed into the sensor and only an on/off signal is passed onto the PLC.  The problem with this approach is that it does not convey how good or bad whatever is being sensed is.  It, instead, merely indicates something is good or bad.  This makes any sort of analytics or process improvements impossible.  IO-Link has been a powerful tool in helping us solve these problems.

We have not used the IFM IO-Link masters with the additional MQTT JSON feature.  We have only deployed the versions with just EtherNet/IP or PROFINET.  I've been very curious about them though.  We have scenarios where we do not have fieldbus connectivity and deploying a standalone IOL master in parallel could potentially work.

@Walker Reynolds brings up a great point about parsing.  One of the reasons that we've had such great experiences with IFM's IOL products is that IFM maintains a library of AOIs and FBs for all their products.  These libraries decode each sensor's payload into useful tags on the PLC.  Without these, it's probably a nightmare.  It's like programming on an old fieldbus.

Perhaps IFM should partner up with HighByte.  Imagine some sort of plugin that decodes the IFM IODD payloads into one's UNS models.","","üëç (2),üíØ (1)"

The reason I ask is that we're looking at using it as a bridge between the native PLC protocols and something like HighByte.  We don't really have practical infrastructure constraints between our PLCs and on-prem servers.  The field networks are logically segmented, small, and have dedicated uplinks.

This means that topics are buffered together at n interval.  Highbyte allows us to do all of the abstraction, modeling and logic management and break the events apart.  So -- we could have topics that publish no faster than x interval and other topics that publish at y interval.  More and more, we need flexibility on the edge.

So, for the heavy weight and feeding the model (not the control logic) on the PLC I'm thinking about things like line calculations derived from cell tags, and things like that, meaning things you could do on Pi Asset Framework. Is that the case? My question is, for new implementations, having all the calculation on the PLC, does it make harder to change calculations later?

What we do in the PLC, line state abstraction (from alarms and conditions to a single status register), alarm arrays, event arrays, count arrays, machine information (manufacturer, install date, sensor definitions).  Any modeling above the machine level gets done outside of the PLC.

I recently used IO-Link in a small machine for a valve bank and touch indicator.  My impressions were mixed. I think IO-Link has potential but is a long ways from being the ""USB of Industrial Machines"" as I have heard it touted. 

In the case of the products I was using, SMC valve bank, Banner K50 Touch Indicator and Turck TBEN-L4-8IOL the IOL documentation  was mediocre to bad. Almost no PLCs have IO-Link built-in so you end up using a fieldbus to talk to an IOL master and it ultimately just adds another layer between the PLC and the device.

When we started down the path of IOL, we mistakenly thought we could use the IOD files that are associated with most devices as a driver that would do a lot of the heavy lifting for us, such as creating an easy path for reading and writing registers on the devices. Turns out that wasn't the case and I ended up needing to write a lot of custom code and bit-shifting to get all the ""bonus data"" that IOL devices offer.  Without the bonus data, an IOL device is just a regular old device that is more difficult to connect to your PLC.

If device manufacturers start offering drivers/function blocks for mainstream IDEs, and/or documentation improves dramatically, I think IOL could be massively beneficial. It would likely still pale in comparison to more general ""smart device"" protocols like I2C or SPI. These protocols are popular in the embedded controls space and benefit massively from economies of scale. With a little hardening, I think they could be used in the Industrial Controls space. Most Arduino and RPi PLCs have it baked in as well.

One thing I did like was the defacto standardization on the M12 cables. This is not actually part of the IOL spec but a lot of manufacturers seem to be organizing around them and they're great! We have a mantra, of ""Never make a cable"" and M12, M8, etc really help here.","",""

There is still a mindset in our industry that we‚Äôre trying to move I/O rather than move information and execute commands.

Client-side, there aren't many apps that support invoking method calls.  And, when they do, discoverability is an issue.  It‚Äôs like trying to calling an API without knowing what it is and how it works.  Most UA client implementations are relics of classic DA.

The alternative is doing bit / byte level data exchange & control flags / handshakes to manage the exchange. All of those bits & bytes are discoverable individually, but their combination as a function is not : that needs to be described. Furthermore, the other party / system participating in the exchange needs to understand & be configured to mirror that bit level logic. Which is easier? A Method call that passes a few parameters. The fact that legacy PLC's are 'in the dark ages' can be remedied with thin edge devices or server based data flow model applications. The point that few legacy PLC's apply OPC data modelling is not a reason not to do it. The best place to build the data model of a device is as close as possible to the source.

There are tons of research and working groups establishing standards.  The asset administration shell in the RAMI 4.0 spec seems to touch upon what you described.

Theoretically, discoverability is not a problem with OPC-UA methods.  But, in practice, it is.  If one is building their own servers and client apps, there are no limits to OPC-UA.  If one is to leverage third-party products with OPC-UA, there are many limitations.  There are so many optional components of the UA spec that rarely get implemented.  This shapes the way applications are built around UA clients.  Even Ignition, a leading platform built on a modern tech stack, struggles with methods.  Their developers even publicly concede this.  They have a client that supports it, but the rest of their application suite can't really make use of it.  To intelligently interact with a 'UA server with methods, one would basically have to build their own module.

My comment referencing the ""dark ages"" is not one about technology per se, but rather its practical adoption.  Even with capable technology available, industrial assets are not being designed for open exchange of information.  That is, it doesn't matter how smart the edge is because there is not much useful to abstract from in the first place.  Assets are often programmed as a standalone, turn-key solution rather than something that must interface with other machines or factory.  ""M2M"" is a good example.  Many machine builders, even in 2020, build automated machines for discrete manufacturing without any sort of interfacing logic for basic material handling (e.g., robot tending).  They're still struggling to even do I3.0 properly.  This is not to say smart edge devices aren't worth it (because they totally are), but rather what they're connected to will pose many challenges.","","üíØ (1)"

At the field level alone, excluding vision and sensors, there were 9 native protocols in use.  And this was all using brand-new stuff.  Reflecting on this project, I can't imagine being able to mandate that everything come pre-installed with an edge gateway with full-featured OPC-UA servers.  The machine builders wouldn't have a clue what to do.  It would be cost prohibitive and would never meet the program's deadlines.

This shouldn't be viewed as a condemnation of any particular technology or architecture.  It should viewed as the realities manufacturers face and how it hurdles adoption.  There exist very real limitations in what manufacturers can mandate their machine builders do.  There are only so many of them in world.  Assets are acquired based on their core productivity and not necessarily their connectivity.  If an asset can crank out higher quality widgets faster at a lower cost, no investor or buyer will care what the communications are.  They'll figure a way around this on their way to the bank.

However, the industry is not completely standardized in how they implement IO-Link so it isn't as ""plug and play"" as it could be. It is NOT yet, the USB of Industrial controls.

Having used other non-ethernet, sensor busses, like I2C, 1-wire and SPI, I don't see any major advantages that IO-Link has over them other than there are industrial blocks you can buy that implement it. IO-Link is slower and costs more.

I've used SPI and I2C in embedded designs extensively. They are dead simple (simple != easy) protocols, SPI especially. SPI is essentially a shift register and fairly easily bit-banged (implemented in SW instead of HW) when needed. The simplicity of I2C and SPI make them blazing fast and cheap. Where they lack is reliability/redundancy.  You'll need to implement check-sums, timeouts, recalls yourself if you need.

I've yet to use either SPI or I2C in the industrial setting. I believe it could be done, and using an Industrial Arduino or RPi from someone like https://www.industrialshields.com/ is probably the way to go.  

That said, neither SPI or I2C is particularly Industrial hardened. They are typically low voltage protocols and thus could be susceptible to noise. There are some existing ICs that could bring I2C into the industrial world such as P82B96 (https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/p82b96.pdf) and PCA9615 (https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCA9615.pdf)

Hackaday has a great article about taking I2C over longer wires: https://hackaday.com/2017/02/08/taking-the-leap-off-board-an-introduction-to-i2c-over-long-wires/

I haven't done as much research on SPI over long distances.

The biggest advantage of I2C is its proliferation in smart phone and other consumer electronics. The extremely high volumes in this space have driven down sensor and chip costs to rock bottom.  For example, you can purchase a 9DOF IMU (3 axis Gryo, 3 axis Accelerometer, 3 axis magnetometer sensor) chip on a board and with source code for $17 https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335. These aren't quite ready for industrial use, but a few bucks worth of plastic and some reliability circuits and you'd have an industrial ready product.

OPC-DA requires legacy Windows technology (i.e., DCOM) with security vulnerabilities and is all around more challenging to support.  It's not really routable and requires Windows dependencies.  OPC Classic (e.g., DA, HDA, AE) was created at a time before the world coalesced around the networking technologies (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP/IP) that make up the internet and today's networks.  OPC-UA has encryption and TCP for transport.  OPC-UA, for these reasons, is an unequivocal improvement on OPC Classic.

If you have OPC-DA today, take a moment to research whether the server is embedded into the controller and what other communications options are available.  Why are you using it?  You might be able to bypass OPC-DA all together.  And if you have legacy DA client apps, don't worry.  You can still use them with UA tunneling.

Most controllers will not have embedded support for ""vertical"" protocols such as OPC-DA, OPC-UA or MQTT.  If they do, there is a good chance it's a ""bolted-on"" gateway module anyway.  Even when controllers support it, adoption is a completely different story.  The machine builders and system integrators are recycling old designs.  And end users, in many cases, could care less.  I digress.

Most controllers will have their own native ethernet-based protocol.  These are often adopted from the ""horizontal"" fieldbus technology they support.  Examples:  Allen-Bradley (EtherNet/IP), Siemens (S7 Messaging), Fanuc Robot (GE-SRTP), Fanuc CNC (FOCAS), Mitsubishi (MELSEC), Schneider (Modbus TCP), Omron (FINS or EtherNet/IP).  Most of these protocols are client/server (aka poll-and-response), but some do have implementations for unsolicited messaging (aka ""fire-and-forget"" or ""report-by-exception"").

From here, you would leverage a gateway to convert from the native protocol to OPC-UA or even directly to MQTT.  Kepware is a popular option.  Leveraging a native driver in Ignition or Factory Studio is also an option.","",""

The UNS Gateway greatly reduces the engineering effort getting these tags into the UNS.  Gleaning from conversations here, it's basically the Kepware IoT Gateway / MQTT Client that @Walker Reynolds would have built.

But, if there is not an existing OPC-UA infrastructure to leverage, the UNS Gateway may not necessarily optimal.

One option could be a hybrid approach of standing up a new infrastructure in parallel to the legacy one.

Over time, you could let the legacy OPC-DA infrastructure die off by slowing migrating your clients (e.g., HMI, apps) off of it.

I highly recommend building out an interface in your PLC program.  What I've found is that when one tries co-exist with existing programs, it does not scale well.   Most PLC programmers take a ""MVP"" approach.  They build a minimally viable product and make assumptions how the data will be consumed.  It's not fun ""shoe horning"" objects designed for the field (by a short-sighted programmer) into upper-level systems.  You will invariably be deriving things and running into limitations.  When you're building apps and infrastructure, you don't want to be bogged down by data quality issues.

The best practice I've seen is to create a separate sub routine and map everything into a clean structure (e.g., UDT).  First and foremost, there are performance benefits to this.  Second, it's organized and easier to consume.  Third, it makes the PLC program and its programmer(s) ""aware"" of what it's connected to.  As logic is maintained over time, there will be a mindset of maintaining the interface as well.

One interesting side-effect of this is that the initially skeptical/weary OT personnel come around to appreciating these interfaces.  The very same short-sighted programmers start to want to use this interface in their machine-level HMI.  They become more object-oriented and start intelligently abstracting and re-using logic.  They break bad habits without feeling like they're being pushed.

I recognize that this is not always possible or practical.  Sometimes you have to model outside the PLC.  Some PLCs, even newer ones, still have register / fixed addressing based memory tables.  They don't have namable tags or structures.  Or, the machine's logic might be locked out by the OEM.  In this instance, try to follow the same principles of organizing and making the data ready for consumption.","",""

I totally get it.  I'm used to these environments.  Despite my fondness for Ignition Edge as a concept, it's not really practical for HMIs on advanced machinery like CNCs.  The applications are too complex and tailored to re-engineer.  Ignition Edge is really limited to supervisory-level HMI in these environments.  It's a great platform, but it's too different from the platform that machines are built on to replace anything.  The HMIs are staying.

I have not used the native OPC-UA servers embedded on the S7 PLCs.  I've only used the native S7 messaging protocol with Kepware.  I like the automatic tag generation and ability to add into an existing OPC-UA server's name space.  It might be worth doing a shoot-out on which is easier to deploy/maintain and their performance.  I have seen some embedded OPC-UA servers that require you to ""select"" which tags to host rather than browse remotely.  Sometimes there are limitations on tag counts.  Additionally, OPC-UA's security is another consideration.

2. We need to forget/adjust the concept that manufacturers *should* be accessing the programs of industrial controllers.

Manufacturers who want to re-program or develop their own machines will need to learn the more powerful languages if they want to leverage the full potential of IIoT

3. Sensor/Device manufacturers will need to start providing good, working, open-source libraries for all their equipment. This will aid towards #2 and build a standard toolset that Machine Builders can leverage and emulate.

I agree with @Jon Forbord JonF as well that the more advanced OOP features like inheritence, and dynamic memory are problematic and I tend to avoid them altogether or use them sparingly in embedded or industrial automation programs.

Are you trying to count them in a single-piece-flow?  Or, are there multiple pieces that need to be counted within a field of view?

Is there specific criteria required to count a piece (e.g., feature detection, shape matching)?  Or, is it simply any object that moves through a to a designated space (e.g., conveyor, fixture, assembly line)?

Here are some potential options that might help frame the discussion.  All of these could transmit your count to a controller via 24VDC, IO-Link, or an Ethernet-based fieldbus protocol.

These are cameras with an accompanied controller that can be deployed similar to the way an industrial sensor is.  These work fairly well for basic pattern detection applications.  If you need to embed this into a product and you have the engineering resources, this approach can be more costly at scale.  If you're looking to go PC-based open architecture as other have mentioned, here's what I've seen work.

OpenCV is the most popular open source vision library by far.  It's very powerful and is constantly innovated.  It's used on everything from autonomous motion to surveillance to automation.  I've even seen it in safety applications for robotics.

SimpleCV is an open source vision library.  Because of the popularity of Ignition and Factory Studio in this community, Python is somewhat well-known here.  SimpleCV is a simplified python-based OpenCV wrapper.  It works pretty well for pattern detection in automation applications.

MVTec Halcon is a commercial vision package.  It's designed for industry.  It has its own IDE, massive vision library, extensive driver support, supports industrial protocols, and works with multiple languages (e.g., C, C++, .NET).  Support for Python was recently introduced.

Cognex VisionPro is another commercial package.  While not as full featured and economical, it's easier to learn than Halcon and much more popular in the US.  It has a .NET interface.

Thinking that machine builders would include one of these devices in equipment, allowing for future growth.

The IIoT space should be a fabric (Network infrastructure and application layer) to seamlessly get you from one place to another. All the non-native applications could be thought of being on the edge, but traditionally it's only been thought of at the levels closest to manufacturing.

So an edge device is something that can directly communicate in the IIoT ecosystem. As @Walker Reynolds#8594 stated, a gateway typically does data pass-through (translation from I've protocol to another). Edge Compute is ingesting data and providing new data at that level, which saves bandwidth and allows processes to react quicker with the reduced latency. Think Machine Learning inference algorithms here.","","üíØ (1)"

The application would drive the selection power of the hardware device and it would be added as another edge node to be managed from a single dashboard.

All these edge devices are a dime-a-dozen, but no one had created a platform to unify the management of them and be agnostic to the hardware.

Unfortunately, Kepware does not have a driver with documented support explicitly for Heidenhain. Depending on the protocol of your machine(s), there might be a driver with unofficial support.

Reach out to your distributor or Heidenhain about connectivity options. Figure out what native communication protocol Heidenhain speaks. It might be proprietary to them.

Inform them that you‚Äôre looking for a communication module (or gateway) that will enable the asset to interface with MQTT, OPC-UA, or possibly MTConnect.

This type of changes would cause the processor to stop and therefore be careful that this does not have any negative effects to your production. 

If you still want a Siemens-based solution without the need to modify your S7-300 configuration and plan downtime, you could use the ""SIMATIC CloudConnect"" CC712 or CC716 (depending on how many S7 devices and protocol) device as an IoT gateway.

CP343 seems like a sensible option.  If you can get the native S7 messaging protocol (""RFC1006"") coming off the PLC as this does, you will have a ton of connectivity options.  There exist many gateways and platforms that natively support this protocol.  Keep in mind that S7 is a ""polling"" protocol.  If you need publish/subscribe architecture, you'll want an MQTT gateway to reside at or near the edge.

As Taylor mentioned, it would be helpful to learn more about your goals.  There are a lot of ways to connect to an S7.  Here are a few potential options:

[S7-300] < S7 protocol > [KepServerEx] < OPC-UA > [HighByte] <MQTT SpB> [MQTT Broker]
[S7-300] < S7 protocol > [KepServerEx] < MQTT > [MQTT Broker]
[S7-300] < S7 protocol -or- PROFIBUS > [CloudConnect7] < MQTT > [MQTT Broker]
[S7-300] < S7 protocol > [Ignition]
[S7-300] < S7 protocol > [FactoryStudio]

These options mostly assume you will be using the S7 protocol.  It's also possible to get access to the controller's data via the fieldbus (e.g., PROFIBUS, PROFINET).  Similar to the S7 protocol, there exist gateways for this.  Depending on your environment and the data you're looking move, this can work quite well.","","üî• (4)"

As kind of an internship, I need to research the required IIoT infrastructure at a manufacturing company and advice on how they should implement it. This also involves describing the best way to connect legacy edge devices (S7-313 without RJ45 connection) to the infrastructure. The first purpose of this connection should be calculating the OEE, but this mostly serves as a proof concept for the IIoT network.  

So in short, I am not limited to a specific protocol, other than PLC that is currently be√Øng used. There also is no Scada system in place at this moment so obviously no infrastructure for a scada system. 

@LuisN Stopping the machine would not be any problem, as long as it can go back online within a few hours. There are about 9 of the same machines, with their own PLC's individually performing their own task. However, thank you for suggesting the SIMATIC CloudConnect. This is definitely an option that I should consider.

@js Thank you for the suggestions! this gives me a lot to research! Two of the options consist of connecting the S7-300 via the S7-protocol directly to Ignition or FactoryStudio. Is that possible when the S7-300 does not have any Ethernet connection possibilities?

They'll require the S7-300 to have an Ethernet module on the backplane (e.g., CP343) or gateway on the fieldbus (Helmholz NETLink Pro, IBH Link S7++, CloudConnect 7).

[S7-300] < backplane > [CP343] < S7 protocol > [...]

[S7-300] < PROFIBUS> [HMS Anybus Edge Gateway] < MQTT or OPC-UA > [...]

I would say the best bet is probably a CP343.  This gets you direct on the backplane and enables you interact with the processor in the most ""pure"" way.  It also opens up the broadest set of driver and gateway options available.

The profibus gateways (e.g., Helmholz, IBH, HMS) can be cost-effective and viable alternatives.  Some have IoT protocol support (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA) which would enable you to bypass S7 protocol all together.

Here are some useful questions to ask internally:

Could anything else make use of the CP343?  Do you need to program the S7 over the LAN?

Is the PROFIBUS interface currently in use?  Would it be an issue adding a gateway onto the existing network?

What kind of asset is it and where is it?  Is it in a factory with ample network resources or is it somewhere remote?

Where do you plan to host the software communicating with this asset?

Do you have space on the backplane of the S7-300 for a CP343?","","üíØ (1)"

To anwser the questions: At this point, nothing else has to make use of the CP343, actually, the IT department does not appreciate programming over LAN. They have a quite primitive but strict way of handling security, eg, no switches in the manufacturing area, every MAC gets blocked unless it is whitelisted.

I think only an HMI is and some IO connected to the PLC but I would have to check whether it is connected via the PROFIBUS connection. Thank you for the suggestion!

It is for nine stand-alone production machines inside the manufacturing factory. We have the possibility to create a decent physical network for it.

We plan to host the software on the company servers that are in the same building but on a different floor. (I would guess at most 200m distance). Hosting it in the cloud could also be an option that I consider. This is unclear at the moment but I have the freedom to choose what I think is best.

Yes, are you familiar with ZEEK?
https://zeek.org/

It's an open source network monitoring platform - super capable.
What's cool is you can write custom protocol modules - so now I direct you over to Amazon's github repo:
https://github.com/amzn?q=zeek&type=&language=&sort=
do a search on ""zeek"" if it doesn't come up.

Or you can goto the Zeek repo: https://packages.zeek.org/packages?q=amzn

Short story is Amazon Fulfillment Technologies created and maintains Zeek adapters for Profinet, S7Comm, EthernetIP, BacNet, and TDS (sql). They are used in-house so they stay current.","","ismile (1)"

Where is the difference between the two when it comes to extending IEC 61131 with these languages? 
Are they both the same approach, or is Phoenix doing something fundamentally different?

There are many ways to use C#/C++ code with PLCnext so I will only mention use cases for when used inside the IEC61131 real-time environment. PLCnext Engineer enables you to use C++ code as a complete program. Data is exchanged with the IEC61131 environment through IN/OUT ports. C# is handled a little differently as it cannot be used as a complete program but rather as a Function called by IEC61131 program.

A few years ago, my colleagues were in a similar situation with AB SLC processors.  They were able to find a bunch of second-hand, higher-end processors with Ethernet.  It ended up being more economical and performant than using a serial gateway.  This enabled connectivity and bought time for the assets to be modernized.

While the acquisition cost of those third-party gateways is appealing, there may be some hidden engineering or performance costs.  In my experience, not all gateways support native memory addressing over the serial connection (e.g., poll bit with address M36.1).  Generally, with fieldbuses, the relevant tags must by ""mapped"" into a contiguous block within the memory.  The gateway will not see this as a natively addressed tag, but a mere sequence of bytes on the fieldbus.  The gateway will need the payload defined.  Additionally, depending on how much data is being moved, there might be performance constraints.

If you know exactly what memory in the PLC you're after, it's not a big deal.  If you're less sure and need to be agile, this can add some friction getting access to data and adapting to changes.

Different scenarios:
1)  Controller has embedded support of an IIoT protocol (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA).  No gateway required.
2)  Controller supports addressing, browsing, and auto tag generation over its native protocol.  Gateway required, but easy setup.
3)  Controller supports addressing over its native protocol.  Requires gateway and knowledge of PLC's ""namespace"".
4)  Controller supports moving data over a field protocol.  Requires gateway, knowledge of PLC's ""namespace"", and new logic for all data consumed.

Order of preference:  1 > 2 > 3 > 4.  In practice, all will benefit from new logic.  But, the later scenarios will be more work.","","üíØ (2),üî• (1)"

How is the development environment?  Beyond I/O, what else in the field can interface with?  Can they handle safety and motion?

It appears that the next-gen controllers have great connectivity and economics but don't necessarily handle all automation disciplines.  Even with connectivity tradeoffs, there are significant benefits of leveraging multi-discipline controllers (e.g., i/o, safety, motion, field communications, alarms, CNC, robotics).  All around, it's a much more flexible architecture.  It can accommodate changes.  It keeps the data in one place.  It's easy to integrate ""vertically"" (machine-to-software) as well as ""horizontally"" (machine-to-machine).

After standardizing on multi-discipline controllers, I can't really imagine going back.  It's not ideal to consume data from assets with disparate controllers exchanging discrete i/o that are barely aware of each other.  It's a nightmare to construct IIoT architecture around this.  It's so much easier to have one ""clean"" control scheme orchestrating everything.  For these reasons and others, we've standardized around offerings from the traditional players (e.g., Rockwell, Siemens, Fanuc).  Fortunately, with Kepware's drivers, connectivity has not been a major problem.

Is anyone else encountering this when they explore these newer IIoT-friendly edge devices?","","üëèüèª (1),üëè (1),üëç (1)"

They are geared towards consumer, and stand-alone sensor/system IoT. They do some things around the IIoT space but I don't think it's a main target for them. They *do* try to push you towards their cloud/console, which is a really great console for fleet management if you want to build a product line on their platform.

The things Iike about OPC-UA are the idea of the companion specs.  They have more than 29 (last time I counted).  The two that stuck out to me were AutoID (barcode, RFID, OCR, etc), and Machine Vision. The analogy of a companion spec is like a device driver on a computer.  There used to be a time when the comptuer didn't know how to handle a mouse connected by comm-port.  Now, every operating system understands the companion spec of the USBmouse: left, right, middle clicks, wheel, and 2D movement.  Of course, there are companies that expand this companion spec to add extra buttons, or more axis for games, and those then require proprietary drivers, but the base function of all mice work the same no matter the vendor.

As a developer of applications, we would benefit from these OPC-UA companion specs, where all my application needs to know about the device is the IPaddress and it already has the AutoID driver built in, so it's plug and play (plug-and-work for the Germans lol).  Now, my application is immune to vendor lock (presuming multiple vendors support the standard).  AutoID is the best case I've seen of market adoption of a companion spec.  Turck, Siemens, SICK have products meeting this.

SparkplugB is really a basic companion spec on transferring data. It really doesn't solve the problem of how you model a piece of equipment.  If Sparkplug started releasing standards on types of SparkplugTemplates, that would help.  Then, vendors can include templates out of the box, which would put less strain on integrators to create the model in applications like HighByte Intelligence Hub.","","üëè (3)"
"794020366536146977","mparris","2021-03-24T01:04:22.9280000+08:00","I also like in OPC-UA that I can browse methods by connecting to a UA Server.  If an application is exposing methods to allow a client to manipulate it, it becomes intuitive for the human.  The parameters of the methods are advertised and can include descriptions of what is expected.  Without much up-front knowledge, it's possible to command an application that is transparent.

SparkplugB doesn't have a good solution for this. Again, it's relying on the developers to bake in what the possible commands are; there isn't a standard way to browse that and then make use of it.  It's also a challenge if multiple devices are calling the same method, and the Sparkplug topic is common betweeen them where the two clients are subscribed to the same response topic.  There's ways around this, but it would be nice for Sparkplug to standardize this to keep the market from going in many different directions.","","üëç (2)"

I have used both MDT and AB AssetCentre.

I like asset center, but like most rockwell products, the licensing got out of control.

I used MDT Autosave while working on contract at GM for years and it worked awesome. It uses Server - Client (each programming computer needs the client installed to monitor changes)

It supports: (this list is not exhaustive, I am sure there are some that I am missing)
- Robots (Fanuc,ABB,etc) 
- PLC's (AllenBradley, Seimens, etc)
- HMIs (AllenBradley, Seimens, etc)
 
It had scheduled intervals to reach into the PLC and copy the program. Autosave compares and records the new most recent version (if a non-autosave user makes changes).

When you want to open a version, Autosave even opens the respective launcher. It monitors the running program editor and if you make a change, when you save, it prompts you for version comments.


You can roll-back changes as well, but there is no text view of changes because of so many different manufacturers file types, but there are other programs that can do that.

This is the most recent video I have seen for using version control as a method for development using the dev->staging->production model.

Because it uses version control, multiple developers can modify and pull request, allowing it to move to stage testing without affecting production.

We recently purchased an Edge device that runs Windows 10 Pro OS and I am trying to test the reliability in the event of a power failure.  

Areas of concern are:
1. OS corruption
2. Database corruption (MS SQL)
3. Project application corruption (Ignition)

What are your thoughts on what to consider or add to the design to ensure robust restarting of the system after a power failure? How to protect the OS, database, and project?

I am thinking UPS with surge protected outlet. UPS can signal the edge system that a power event occurred and shutdown sequence can start from there.

Thanks in advance","",""

This problem space extends well beyond the industrial space.  Because Ignition runs a service, it's pretty resilient to be stopped by the OS.  Likewise, for SQL Server, it's configured by default to wait for stored procedures and perform database checkpoints.  It will figure out what to commit or roll back.  Preventing corruption is a key feature of SQL Server.

Eaton has an elaborate system that can gracefully pause/shutdown VMs and sequence everything.  Probably overkill for a one-off Edge device, but it works well a facility-wide solution.  APC PowerChute is another established data center centric product.

It's really showed up on legacy or lower-volume components for automation and electrical.  Think controllers, actuators, and interface modules that can't be easily substituted.  Items that once took a day or two now take months.  Many of these products have limited inventory and their replenishment are tied to just-in-time contract manufacturing.  The problem with contract manufacturing is that not all batches can be produced at the same time.  The capacity must be shared.  Mainstream, higher-volume automation products have not been as bad.  I believe these are produced in larger batches and warehoused (and priced) to avoid shortages and lifecycle issues.  Beyond that, the semi-conductor shortage has induced purchases to horde spares as well as hedge further price increases.  Another factor is how manufacturers in the affected sectors are handling their shut down plants or reduced capacity.  Many are taking advantage of it by pulling ahead planned maintenance or overhaul projects.  It's further driving consumption.  Some manufactures are trying to just catch up from last year.  The shutdowns (and recoveries) hit Asia, Europe, and North America at different times.  This put a lot of stress on global supply chains and created pent-up demand independent of consumer electronics.","","üëç (2)"

However, that downturn didn‚Äôt materialise at all (in some sectors) or wasn‚Äôt as bad as anticipated (in other sectors). It‚Äôs taking chip manufacturers some time to come back on stream.

If the PLC initiates communications then the firewall will pass any response from the UNS back to the PLC. However, you would not be able to connect to the PLC from outside. So, let's say a setpoint is changed in the UNS. The PLC will only get that update when it pulls it from the UNS, the UNS cannot push it to the PLC.

It's no different to your home internet connection. Most home firewalls have all inbound ports closed but you can still access the internet.

There are some things that make sense to be on the internet (IIoT), and others where it's not appropriate.  With IIoT, you are creating an Internet. Not everything should have access to it or live on the internet directly.

Not everything will satisfy the requirements of an IIoT Ecosystem, and that's ok, even for a greenfield project.  The purpose of the IIoT Ecosystem is to connect the higher-level things together, or disparate systems together.

All the field bus protocols will continue to exist and that is a good thing.  IIoT is not out to replace them.  That's similar to IT saying that they will replace all your plant's Network Architectures, security risk reviews, certificate authorities, etc with their processes. It isn't appropriate, and it won't work.

 IIoT does not live at the field bus level; It's intended to be at a higher level than that.  So keep using OPC-UA, Ethernet IP, Profinet, EtherCAT, modbus, bacnet, etc without regretüòÉ  IIoT comes into play as you move outside the fieldbus world and connecting to different applications and systems.

I have not encountered any standalone safety controllers with IIoT protocol interfaces.  Just fieldbus communications.  I've personally observed it's more effective and practical to globally buy/build automation with a PLC that is *safe* than it is to make a safety controller *smart*.

**Integrated Safety**
Wherever possible, use a multi-discipline controller with integrated safety (and motion).  Yes, the processor and i/o will often cost more, but it lowers the total cost of ownership.  Having everything in one control plane does wonders for engineering, data accessibility, maintenance, and flexibility.  Need to add another robot, conveyor, gate, safety zone, etc?  Just plug it in and update the program.  The resulting changes are made available to the HMI(s) and IIoT infrastructure.  With a standalone safety controller, it's too easy for data to get stranded or lose context.  Everything must be explicitly mapped to a fieldbus or contacts and then deciphered on the other end.  It creates friction.

Siemens:  SINUMERIK 840D SL, S7-1500
Fanuc:  R-30iB Plus w/ DCS, Series 32i-B w/ DCS

**Standalone Safety**
It's not always an option to use integrated safety controllers.  You know the drill... brownfield, unique/disparate controllers, lazy machine builders, etc.  ABB Pluto series is flexible and cost effective.  They have a lot of accessories.  It's a CAN bus safety network with various fieldbus gateways for monitoring.  The software is on par with the market... it's old and ugly.  Rockwell has a programmable safety relay based on the Micro 820 series.  It can be programmed using CCW or embedded into a Studio 5000 project.

Integrated safety PLCs are like two separate controllers in one.  The safety module has its own compute and memory resources.  It has an independent scanning sequence, routines and specialized instruction sets.  There are limitations in how the safety and standard tags can be used.  It's a much more prescriptive and restrictive development environment.  It actually can trip up old school programmers accustomed to traditional safety relays and MCRs.  Initially, they're likely to struggle grasping all the safeguards to get their program to simply run.  It forces one to account for not just logic, but also tampering (e.g., jumping, latching).  Everything can be signed and locked down.  Safety and non-safety roles can be segmented.

As Jon mentioned, one is much more likely to lock up their PLC than introduce unsafe conditions.  They're inherently safe.  One of the largest lessons learned after settling on an integrated safety architecture and piloting it is training.  While conceptually similar to a standard PLC, there do exist key differences.  Getting familiar with the prescribed ways to achieve safety objectives can take a moment.  Fortunately, a lot of the manuals for these products written in an application-oriented way.  The applications engineers and training programs at distributors are good resources.","","üëç (1)"

In another channel, @Durga Kolli posted a link that IFM appears to now publish Ignition templates / UDTs.  Previously, IFM only maintained libraries for major PLC platforms for their products.  This meant that one had to manually parse/decipher payloads if they were bypassing the PLC communications and instead leveraging MQTT.  This appears to no longer be the case.

I really must applaud IFM's approach of providing open *and* turn-key integrations for their products.  Maintaining an integration to a leading product like Ignition (in a non-exclusive way) does a lot more for the industry than endorsing theoretical industry standards that no one is adopting in a meaningful way.  #WinTheResultsWar

Arduino and Rasp Pi get a bad raps in professional circles because their initial target was education and makers/hobbyists, but their underlying core is state of the art micro-controllers like STMs. It's all about the hardening of the circuits. Both companies have made more and more hardened devices, like Portenta for Arduino and the Compute Modules for Raspberry Pi

They don't hold your hand like a PLC does when you're programming it and I think that is actually going to be the biggest thing keeping them from wide adoptance in manufacturing. It's easy to solve the MTBF problem, add better hardware. It's harder to solve the skill upgrade problem that programming in C/C++ vs ladder require.

The tradeoff is your Arduino or micro-controller based machine controls are way more powerful and flexible for the price. For $40 you can buy a RAMPS kit, which is an Arduino and the necessary hardware to control a 3D printer. That's 4+ stepper motor drives (high speed outputs), motion control, tons of analog inputs, relay outputs, and several PID loops running simultaneously on what is considered outdated micro-controller tech at this point.

Would I use that grade of hardware in a professional environment? Hell no! It's not rugged enough. But don't discount the reliability of any controller just because it's Arduino or Pi under the hood.","","üíØ (2)"

For instance, every component (analog and digital inputs and outputs, specific sensors, stepper motor drivers, ...) would have its class that would perform necessary tasks.
There would be, as I imagined, set of virtual components (filters, integrators, voting components (2-out-of-3), signal processors in general) that would accept 1 or more other components (digital or analog) on input and send results of processing to 1 or more outputs which could again be inputs to other blocks etc.
There would be a ""master"" class (I call it component manager) that would initialize all components on startup, read all hw inputs and write them to component raw input data on start of the cycle and write all the component output data to hw output pins.

In other words, one could accomplish ""manual operation"" by configuring hardware in Excel or such, export it to CSV or something, include that in your program and there you go, your MCU reads, filters and process all the inputs, and is writing (or is ready to) all the outputs.
Components would be easy to modify or extend (inheritance) and it would be also easy to add new ones (new class, inherited from some super or abstract class).

Another thing that changed with V3 is that you can specify how many bytes/characters you are passing by setting the ""PubMessageCnt"" to the amount of bytes/characters to pass (no longer limited to 800 characters). In the application example, they are passing a message ""HELLO WORLD"" as the payload. The ""pubMessageCnt"" parameter is therefore set to 11...

Add the possibility to easily build multiple topics and payloads and set the block input to publish a set of payloads and topics. Currently I'd have to build this myself, as well as manage the iteration of topic publishing. Not very hard to do if you're well experienced PLC programming - but I would argue it should still be even easier. Bosch rexroth have a payload structure add method that even checks if value changed in order to decide to publish or not within the cycle. The publish method also handles the queueing, so for every cycle I can push all the structs to the publish block, without having to consider if the block is finished with the previous publish or not. FYI I've only read the documentation and briefly tried it with Tia Portal. I guess my question is - have I understood the docs correctly if I assume that in order to publish to multiple topics, I'd have to send each one separately and wait for the .done feedback to push the next?","",""

The initial impression of the library is that it would require too much time to make use of the library, because it doesn't inherently invoke the functionality to publish loads of topics and payloads, so in short: Make it easier to set up with multiple payloads and topics. Even doing some of the string conversion necessary a part of the library, rather than leave it up to the user, would also make this easier. I don't even know if this is possible on a siemens  PLC, but say supply with a json-library, that can convert a value based on data type, and build json payloads with timestamp, value and data type. It don't even have to support passing complex types, but further down the line, this is an obvious further improvement, including Report By Exception. So I'd just have to call the json value converter for the values I'd like to publish, add each value to an array of payload/topics that I could pass to the MQTT block. Anyone else have any thoughts on what they would like to see to make the LMQTT library even better?","","ü§ù (1)"

IO-Link is a serial-based protocol for sensors governed by PROFINET International.  It can work with actuators too, but vast majority of products on the market are sensors.  I've encountered pneumatic valve manifolds and servo motors with it.  Because these types of actuators were ""big"" and ""smart"" enough to have Ethernet-based fieldbuses, offering IO-Link interfaces was not much of a challenge. Sensors, on the other hand, are much more mixed world.

**[IO-Link benefits on ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúbig‚Äù sensors]**
Some sensors are ""big"" and expensive while others are ""small"" and low cost.  The ""big"" sensors can be critical instrumentation for the process industry.  They cost thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars.  Think Endress+Hauser.  These often have enough compute to support an Ethernet-based fieldbus.  The ""small"" sensors, by comparison, are much more simple.  They can cost tens or hundreds of dollars.  Think IFM.  They might have no compute at all or just enough to pass a basic 24VDC or 4-20mA electrical signal over a basic M12 cable.  Much of the intelligence is derived by a PLC interpreting discrete or analog signals coming off the sensor.

IO-Link exposes much more intelligence and context in sensors.  It's not just an unscaled process value (e.g., 4-20mA scaled to temp) or switching signal (e.g., 24VDC when below temperature set point).  It can exchange multiple process values natively, units of measure, configuration, product info, diagnostics, etc.  And it does so in standardized way with required documentation.","",""

IO-Link also simplifies the physical interfacing.  It leverages standard, unshielded M12 field wiring manufacturers are already accustomed to for control power and low-voltage field devices.  Single-pair ethernet is becoming available for longer and more complex cable runs.

While IO-Link can benefit both ‚Äúbig‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù sensors, it‚Äôs most beneficial for ‚Äúsmall‚Äù sensors.  These smaller sensors could take the form of a low-cost level or pressure switch.  Today, these don‚Äôt provide much intelligence.  They only are used for basic process control (i.e., good state, bad state).  But, tomorrow they could provide much more information and context.  Unfortunately, replacing these sensors to become IP-based nodes could be cost prohibitive and impractical.  Supporting things like TCP or UDP is a step-up in device and infrastructure complexity.  This is where the simplicity of IO-Link excels.  It‚Äôs lightweight and simple enough to run on smaller sensors.","",""

**[IO-Link Support]**
An IO-Link connection consists of IO-Link Master and IO-Link device.  The IO-Link Master functions as the ‚Äúclient‚Äù node.  It manages all the IO-Link configurations and connections.  Sometimes the IO-Link Master is an interface module on a PLC backplane.  More often, it‚Äôs a gateway with various forms of Ethernet fieldbus connectivity to connect to a PLC‚Äôs fieldbus network.  All the data from the IO-Link Master (and the devices connected to it) get mapped into the PLC‚Äôs memory.  

Some IO-Link Masters have IIoT interfaces (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA, HTTP) that enable standalone use without a PLC.  Some even allow simultaneous PLC fieldbus and IIoT connectivity.  This provides the flexibility of determining whether to consume sensor data from the control layer and any associated context -or- directly from the sensor itself.

Any IO-Link Master can connect to any IO-Link device.  The IO-Link spec requires all devices to have a defined payload in what‚Äôs referred to as an IO Device Description (IODD).  Each device has an IODD file.  This is an XML document which functions as a driver of sorts.  Most IO-Link configuration software or software libraries can import the IODD files.  This informs the application of what the IO-Link devices are and what data can be exchanged with them.

Leveraging an IO-Link Masters and devices of the same brand with a mainstream PLC (e.g., Rockwell, Siemens) typically yields the best experience.  The larger sensor companies, especially IFM, have done an incredible job at building out PLC software libraries (e.g., AOI, FB) that map in the IODD data structures from their IO-Link products.  They maintain libraries for virtually every mainstream PLC platform.  IFM has even built out libraries and visualizations for Ignition.  This frees the user from having to build out UDTs for each sensor they want to connect.","",""

Without these slick libraries automatically transforming and mapping the data structures for you, setting up IO-Link can feel like programming a fieldbus.  It involves reading the IODD and parsing out the payload accordingly.  The IO-Link standard defines the payload, but it does not define what each application should do with it.  As a result, leveraging products that do this work for you end-to-end can pay off. 

**[IO-Link Masters + sensors without IO-Link?]**
As for whether any sensor can be connected to an IO-Link Master, the short answer is no.  The long and somewhat brand-specific answer is yes.  Strictly speaking, the IO-Link spec defines a protocol between IO-Link Masters and IO-Link devices.  But, there‚Äôs no reason why an IO-Link device itself can‚Äôt be I/O.  

Some IO-Link Masters have configurable ports for IO-Link devices or discrete I/O.  Some models even have high-current outputs for larger actuators.  A 0/24VDC sensor could be connected a port configured as a discrete input.

There exist IO-Link devices called hubs.  They‚Äôre basically remote i/o.  They connect to an IO-Link Master and provide both discrete and analog I/O.  Connecting multiple hubs to a single master can create staggering volumes of I/O.  There are even standalone devices that convert an analog input into IO-Link.  A 0/24VDC or 4-20mA sensor could be connected to any of this I/O.","",""

The only people I've met that had strong opinions on Kepware were those that were unfamiliar with it or the technology in general.  They usually were accustomed to using something else (e.g., RSLinx, InGear) for a very narrow purpose.  They almost always prefer it after being enlightened.

I'm assuming this is in Europe.  Might be mis-priced or an issue with the local distributor?  Reach out to Ole Borgbjerg at Kepware for assistance.  Super friendly and helpful guy.

I left the LMQTT approach in favor of a OPC UA-> Mqtt gateway (opto 22 RIO with Ignition onboard for instance). My immediate thinking is that if your plc has more than a handful of datapoints you want to send with LMQTT, is to use code generation to generate the code that takes a data block, converts to json and adds time stamp etc on change. My basic code generation approach with Siemens is to first write the code for one instance of what you need in TIA, export the blocks to xml (Tia openness or Tia version control), add placeholders for the code that changes for each instance, and that‚Äôs your xml template. Then to generate code you add instances of the template and replace the placeholder for each instance of the object (data point in this case). Its actually not very time consuming if you know some C# for instance. I‚Äôm not sure on whether limitations in the LMQTT library would allow this to be done at scale though.

You could probably do something similar for programming the PLCs, then control who has access to that VLAN.

Not all EtherNet/IP connections are the same.  From my experience, learning this can be painful and time consuming.  It's not always obvious in product documentation.

Most SCADA/HMI/Gateway drivers are designed to interface with a PLC and not necessarily field devices.

Most scales are treated like field devices (e.g., drives, valves, remote i/o) and their EtherNet/IP interfaces are implemented as such.  That is, they are EtherNet/IP Adapters.  They serve up data cyclically when initiated by an EtherNet/IP Scanner such as a PLC.  This is referred to as a ""Class 1"" or ""implicit messaging"" connection in the ODVA CIP spec.  Basically, it's the real-time control traffic that goes over UDP.  It's for efficiently moving I/O.

cMT-SVR has a generic EtherNet/IP driver, but it's for explicit messaging.  This is a ""Class 3"" CIP connection.  This is the non real-time traffic that goes over TCP.  Think HMI commands, parameter setting, recipe management, etc.  These benefit more from a stateful connection (e.g., handshaking, acknowledgement) than they do speed.

I would strongly recommend researching the EtherNet/IP interface on those scales.  Most drivers and gateways don't function as a typical EtherNet/IP Scanner found on a PLC.  The ones that do are much more specialized and rare.

For this reason and others, I've found it can make a lot of sense using PLCs as gateways.  Many field devices are designed with the assumption that they only connect to PLCs.  They're also sufficiently ""dumb"" without a PLC.  The effort to connect to and contextualize some field devices without a PLC can exceed the cost of leveraging a PLC.

If PLCs are already present, I would leverage those.  With most off-the-shelf products, it's easier to connect to a PLC than it is to a scale.  Either way, the data can still be published via MQTT from the edge.  Coming straight off the scale may not be the most efficient way.","","üëçüèª (1)"

From an industrial cyber security perspective, this is more clear. 

To answer your question as to ""relevancy of OPC UA at the edge"" - OPC UA, as shown in the diagram provided, is great for the OT space where you have to communicate to an edge gateway or controller or horizontally to other PLCs/machines or SCADA systems. Anything above the PLC/SCADA, MQTT is recommended because it is ultimately more scalable than OPC UA","","üëç (2)"

The idea of a safety controller is that you program it like a PLC, but just for the safety functions. So it isolates your safety function. People like to go with the safety PLC (all in one), because many times the same IO being used for safety is needed for general logic, and creating a remote IO interface between the general PLC and the Safety Controller may be too cumbersome, compared to a safety PLC, which allows access to both safety and non safety IO all in one place.","",""

This looks somewhat similar to Honeywell / Tridium‚Äôs Niagara framework.  Niagara, like JC ADS, is a building management SCADA.  They have edge devices, called JACE controllers, that function as remote I/O and protocol gateways for legacy field devices (e.g., compressors, air handlers).  These appear to be similar to JC SNE devices.

If Niagara was relegated as brownfield and the context in it didn‚Äôt matter, an instance of Kepware would be stood up to talk to field devices directly.  If context in Niagara mattered, data would get pulled from it.  Typically, the HTTP or OPC client drivers would get used to write to an external server.  In more recent versions, OPC-UA Server and MQTT client drivers were added.  This is preferable.

The only difference is that this JC system seems much more ‚Äúsolution-centered‚Äù.  There appears to be a lot of ways to get data into the system from the field, but not many ways to get it out.

It looks like JC ADS has a client interface for the SNE devices over its own, presumably, proprietary protocol.  It also appears to natively connect to BACnet/IP devices.  What I don‚Äôt see is a way to expose the SNE or ADS software as a ‚Äúserver‚Äù for an external system to connect to.  I only see third-party protocol support on the ‚Äúfield‚Äù side of the SNE.  It‚Äôs not clear what the SNE can connect to ‚Äúupwards‚Äù other than the JC ADS software.","",""

First, decide how much of the JC system matters.  If the JC software does not play an important role, consider bypassing it.  Decoupling the field devices from the JC application with a more open gateway (e.g., Kepware, Maple Systems) could provide more flexibility.  The SNEs are ‚Äústranding‚Äù field data into a silo.  With an alternative gateway, all the field devices could be publishing and subscribing to a broker.  The JC ADS and other applications (e.g., Ignition, Canary) could connect to this.  It‚Äôs much more preferable to build context in a ‚Äúhub‚Äù (i.e., UNS) than in a spoke (i.e., JC ADS).

If the field devices are tightly coupled with the JC system and this cannot change, you‚Äôll need to find a way to get data out of the software.  Inquire if there is a way to expose the application as an OPC-UA Server or an MQTT client.  If not, you may need to take the context and publish ‚Äúdown‚Äù through one the SNE interfaces (e.g., OPC-UA Client, BACnet/IP) to a ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù field device.  The SNE could write to memory tags exposed as a OPC-UA Server from something like Ignition or Kepware.  Or, work with a protocol gateway company like RTA to develop a specific solution.

In short, figure out what level of context you need from these devices.  If you‚Äôre pulling from the SNE gateways or BACnet/IP layer, there won‚Äôt be a ton of context.  This is okay if there are bigger and better plans beyond the JC ADS and you plan to rearchitect.  If you simply need some existing building management data published into your IIoT infrastructure, look for a way to connect to the JC ADS software.  This is where the context is.","",""

The machine builders typically have their own proprietary controls.  They assume that plants are homogenous with one brand and series of machines.  They base their approach to software and connectivity around this.  At the same time, they're very active in Euromap and OPC Foundation.  Euromap, in general, is puzzling to me.  It's cool the machine builders coalesce around a standard, but they standardize things in weird ways.  

Euromap 67 is a not really a protocol, but a machine-to-machine discrete i/o implementation.  It's like integrating an injection molding machine with an old robot without a fieldbus.  It's basically a standardized handshake over dry contacts.  Because it's for machine tending robot applications (e.g., load, unload), the intelligence it will provide is limited.  With some interpreting logic, you could possibly derive availability (e.g., machine not ready) and utilization (e.g., cycling) information.

Euromap 63 is a file-based protocol.  I like to think of it as the ""What if injection molding professionals tried to build a ""data hub"" (e.g., OPC Server, Broker) in Excel?"" protocol.  The machines and apps read/write to a text file on a server.  In contrast to other protocols (e.g., HTTP, OPC, MQTT, E/IP, S7), Euromap 63 is perplexing.  Why use files?  I'm sure there is some reason and history behind it.  Perhaps it was originally intended for program transfers (think like direct numerical control on CNCs) and it blossomed into data collection?

Anyways, if you can get access to the machine builder's OPC-UA Server, use it.  Some machine builders actually create decent OPC-UA interfaces for their products.  It's much easier than setting up FTP connections, learning the nuances of the machine builder's Euromap implementation, and then mapping text fields into OPC tags. 
 Another option is to ask if they have a fieldbus interface.","",""

[Fanuc Robot] <- GE-SRTP -> [KEPServerEx] <- OPC-UA -> [HighByte] <- MQTT SpB -> [MQTT Broker]

Yes, it's best to keep move the native protocols to the edge of network.  This keeps the poll/response and unsecured traffic away from everything else.  This is accomplished by leveraging a gateway.  Ignition Edge is an option.  I believe this might be able to be licensed for just connectivity (e.g., drivers, MQTT transmitter) not necessarily as a local SCADA/HMI.  You could also use HighByte Intelligence Hub, Maple Systems cMT-SVR, etc.  Edge does not necessarily mean it has to be a physical gateway residing in a panel.  It could be on a centralized server.  The point is to avoid native protocols and OPC-UA client/server traversing rest of the network.  Past this point, the IIoT ecosystem can exchange intelligence with security pub/sub and discoverability.

Personally, I'm a fan of a segmentation.  I typically opt to put every operation (i.e., group of machines) or machine (i.e., group of devices) in its own VLAN.  First, this minimizes the broadcast domain for field traffic.  Second, it simplifies troubleshooting, management and security.  If an operation needs to reach another operation or be exposed to an centralized protocol gateway, it gets issued a role associated with a policy to do so.  By segmenting and identifying everything, the infrastructure can be intent-based and self-aware.

The purdue security model implementations typically involve standing up rigid DMZs at each level of the ISA95 stack.  This is well-intentioned, but doesn't scale well in most environments.  Many orgs don't know what's on their industrial network and what the traffic should be.  They just know when something is down.  Combine this with manually administering DMZs explicitly rule-by-rule and appliance-by-appliance, and it does not serve anyone well.  It's also not particularly effective against internal breaches within a layer.","","üëç (2)"

The Kepware MQTT interface, however, requires additional licensing which can cost almost as much as HighByte.  And HighByte does a lot more than publish large JSON payloads to a topic.  In addition to sparkplug, it also has ""vanilla"" MQTT interfaces.  I acknowledge that using two gateways can appear counterintuitive.  The modeling, above everything else, is the reason to pair the two.  The Kepware plugins, such as Advanced Tags or Scheduler, can't come close.

Most Fanuc-based assets aren't all that contextual off-the-wire anyways.  They still have old-school, register-based addressing and no memory structures.  The implementations, especially on CNCs, vary wildly.  They almost always require extensive modeling work to make their data useful.","",""

My worry is that unless an Report by Exception event occurred (on the edge device)the Control/Setpoint would not move out to the edge until the edge made contact.

And the implementation of request/response in MQTT 5 is an ugly hack IMO - it needs to be done correctly or at least a better pattern on top of ""plain"" MQTT.  If we want to implement event-driven apps, a better path would have been to have both response and error topics.  But there's so much that needs fixing with request/response (which DCMD doesn't really fix), that some major surgery is needed or a completely different invocation path.  

Topic aliases aren't really topic aliases - MQTT would benefit hugely from true topic aliases which would allow multiple projections of topic namespaces/UNS's optimized for different purposes (e.g. devices could publish into a device-centric namespace, which could be mapped transparently into an asset or other organizational namespace - kinda like symlinks).  

Topics should have optional metadata (durable attributes of a topic), and creating child topics is a crappy way to do this (leads to topic bloat).  This metadata would be useful for a number of things, including providing search parameters for discovery APIs and for enabling far better kinds of wildcard subscriptions.

I've heard the argument repeatedly that ""you can still use plain MQTT in parallel"" - which of course you can, but this requires a ton of additional work and mapping.  The antithesis of the supposed plug-and-play nature of Sparkplug, which is basically a super generic entity model rather than knowing that X is a pump, Y is a storage tank, Z is a case packer, etc...

I have some concerns about base data types as well :  I'm not sure why they chose coarse grained timestamps (milliseconds aren't enough in some applications), not sure why there aren't richer concepts around device types or reusable models, and there are some similar odd semantics around Template(s), very little control over subscription/notification granularity (e.g. no deadbanding or time boxing), lack of common IoT data types in the base type model (location being a glaring omission, no blob type, etc), and so on.

-Support for both general and motion instructions.  Sometimes its nice to program a drive as axis of motion and other times it's not.  Sometimes, motion control is not even an option on some controllers.  Having options makes one flexible.

-PLC software libraries (e.g., Add-On-Instruction/Profiles, Function Blocks) for programming and setup

-Dynamic UDTs that expose all data but ""hide"" what's not being used.  It's annoying sorting through ""null"" parameters tied to features not being used.

-Reference projects and libraries for major platforms to consume these UDTs (e.g., Ignition Perspective, AWS, Canary).

-Technical marketing collateral on how to implement predictive maintenance practices and leverage the intelligence coming off the drive.  They should be showing how to orchestrate this in third-party platforms and CMMS/EAM apps.

-Available companion accessories (e.g., line reactor/filters, resistance breaks, encoders)

-""Modular"" commissioning software.  Ideally, something that doesn't require downloading every version of every product.  There should be easy way to install/update for just what's needed.  After finally creating an account to login and locate what software is needed, there's nothing worse than installing a massive application to simply run a setup procedure or set a few parameters.  In other words, make it easy, but don't make it bloated.

-Perhaps some sort of CLI or HTTP console to avoid installing software and all the lifecycling headaches that comes with that?

It's surprisingly non-trivial to figure out what is optimal.  It's almost as bad as Microsoft, Cisco, or even Oracle.  And it's not just Rockwell.  Siemens, Fanuc, and others are a pain too.

All licenses should be transferable.  There should be some license file residing on the machine.  You would use the FactoryTalk Activation Manager utility to ""re-host"" the license.  This can be downloaded from the Rockwell portal.  Basically, you would check in the license to your Rockwell account using the utility and then check it out to ""host"" it on the new workstation.  It will be helpful to know the customer no, serial no, product key, etc.

If you want to bypass the licensing transfer debacle, take a look into the new subscription licensing.  You could purchase the software for just a year.  Unfortunately, because you're using CompactLogix and MicroLogix, they each require a different development environment to program.  CompactLogix are programmed with Studio 5000 (aka RSLogix 5000 for older firmware levels).  MicroLogix 1500 is programmed with RSLogix 500.  Check out the Studio 5000 Legacy Edition bundles.  This will include both development environments and everything else for the old architecture (e.g., SLC, MicroLogix) and the new (e.g., CompactLogix, ControlLogix).

If I recall, there might be a 30-day grace period for activation.  This might allow you to make the small changes on your own workstations without messing with the legacy Windows XP deployment.","",""

SIMATIC, as a brand, has technically been around since the 1950s.  It had a solid foot in industry before the Modicon 084 PLC came out in the late 60s.  Between this period and the advent of PROFIBUS in the early 90s, there were all sorts of early serial protocols (e.g., AS511 in the S5 era).

I would say another contributing factor is Germany's natural resources.  Germany is much more likely to import oil and gas than produce it.  Hoppe is far less likely to see what Nipper has seen in the American-Southwest.  I suspect that industrial assets in the energy sector make up the lion's share of legacy nodes.  Anecdotally, I hear of all sorts of ancient Modicon and Allen-Bradley controllers still chugging along in this sector.

Personally, I have not encountered much Modbus in discrete manufacturing.  But that's because I'm generally working with Rockwell, Fanuc, and Siemens.  Regardless, Modbus is almost always an interface option.  It's easier to find a Modbus interface than it is OPC-UA or MQTT.  Fieldbus (and protocols in general) adoption has always been function of automation brand than consumer choice.  If one has spent their career around Siemens or Beckhoff, they're only seeing a slice of the global automation market.","","üíØ (2)"

Present are EtherCAT, EtherNet/IP, IO-Link, CANopen, PROFINET, POWERLINK, CC-Link, and SERCOS.  To the OPC Foundation's credit, the ""owner"" of modbus, Schneider Electric is present in the FLC initiative.  But, Schneider's ""byzantine empire"" of a portfolio also has preferential support for EtherNet/IP, SRTP, etc.  It's just odd that a company can be working on Modbus/TLS and OPC-UA FLC/TSN in parallel.  It's confusing for the consumer.  Perhaps Schneider is bearish on OPC-UA (beyond basic Client/Server Data Access) and hedging it by enhancing good-old Modbus with security?

In terms of fostering adoption, I must call into question any strategy that prioritizes POWERLINK and SERCOS nodes over Modbus.  There are probably more Modbus nodes produced each year than B&R or Bosch-Rexroth have produced in a decade or even a lifetime.  Sure, Modbus is just register-value pairs.  But, in practice, are other fieldbuses much more?  For example, most EtherNet/IP nodes barely scratch the surface of what the ODVA CIP spec is capable of.  If one is serious about adoption, wouldn't there be a ""seamlessly map your modbus registers into an information model today"" marketing campaign?","",""

You will need to aggregate it to a more powerful piece of hardware. Coupled to security concerns as you mentioned, there will most certainly always be a gateway. So this begs the question if it's worth the monumental task to standardize on a common protocol at the device level.

Should the link between the PLC and SCADA be solved? That seems to already be covered by software like Kepware.

So the real value is above SCADA and into MES and above.

So definitely confused by the enthusiasm for FLC of having all the PLCs talk the same language.  If it's real, it will be nice, but there's a good chance that these companies are all playing lip-service to appear to be cooperative and progressive.

It's there and useful, but it's little context.  Machine control technology is too rigid and limited to gather context at scale.  Industrial HMIs suck more than ERP or MES interfaces.  Why do we think this will elicit more context?

You're spot on about SCADA/DCS should be the gateway to the brownfield intelligence.  But, none of the technology standards focus on this in a meaningful way.  It's all about collecting data from the edge to relay to the cloud for monetized compute and processing.  It's the most lazy ""fleet"" use cases.  Every cloud provider or telecom company wants to provide low-context data collection and analytics for the low-low price of x per y per z.  Any org with sufficient scale and homogeneity in assets is going to eventually elect to do this themselves for less.  If we were serious about SCADA/DCS as gateway, we would see more than the basic OPC-UA-DA or HTTP interfaces.  For example, why aren't there OPC-UA information models with reference architectures for FactoryTalk, WinCC, DeltaV, Wonderware, Ignition etc?

I am very much interested in the discussions of problems being solved and what products are available to make it happen.

After experiencing the work required to integrate hundreds of OPC UA servers and experiencing the ease of integrating hundreds of SparkplugB devices, the benefits cannot be overstated.

In the scope of data access, OPC UA and Sparkplug are both tools to do the job, but at some point one must ask if it's worth chiseling letters into stone vs writing them on paper. As you would say, it depends on the requirements, so if ""the writing shall survive rain"" then stone is an option, but know that there are other quicker options.

The kick in the teeth is that OPC UA could have implemented the concepts of Sparkplug, but they didn't. Sparkplug was commercially available 2 years prior to the release of the OPC UA pub/sub spec, and even then they failed to spec out the ability to discover other devices (topic standardization).

It could be the case that end users still prefer implementing the""Kepware"" strategy which is to connect directly to devices over their native protocol, then it's a question of what protocol to use for the next hop.

While the transport and payloads are different, the namespace is logically the same.  The same tag structure will show up in the ItemIDs when the client browses the server.

If you can, I would advise ditching FTLinx and using Kepware (e.g., Allen-Bradley Suite, Manufacturing Suite) instead.  It's a far more polished and intuitive product.   Rockwell actually embeds some of Kepware's own native drivers into one of the FTLinx versions (""KEPServer Enterprise"").  I would only recommend sticking with FTLinx if there is across-the-board Rockwell investment as well as some of the security and device management features are in use.

As @Richard Shaw and @RickBullotta mentioned, the benefits are cross platform support and security.

**IIoT Connectivity for AB PLCs**
When you say existing OPC-DA servers, I'm assuming you mean a software gateway like RSLinx Classic?  In that case, yes, I would replace it.  This is an especially good idea if you no longer have an OPC Classic application nodes (""OPC-DA Clients"").  Why bother converting to OPC Classic if it's eventually converted to something else?

As you can see, you have many options of the adapting native AB protocols.  You can use OPC-UA or you can bypass it all together.  It really depends on what other nodes and protocols you work with.  I personally prefer a Kepware + HighByte approach.  I like Kepware's wide selection of native drivers and I like HighByte to cleanse/organize the data coming through those drivers.

[AB PLC] <- E/IP or PCCC -> [Kepware] <- OPC-UA -> [HighByte] <- MQTT / SpB -> [Broker]
[AB PLC] <- E/IP or PCCC -> [Kepware w/ IoT GW] <- MQTT -> [Broker]
[AB PLC] <- E/IP or PCCC -> [Ignition w/ MQTT Transmitter] <- MQTT / SpB -> [Broker]
[AB PLC] <- E/IP or PCCC -> [RTA 460ETCQT] <- MQTT -> [Broker]

**Adapting OPC Classic Nodes**
If you still have some legacy nodes running OPC Classic, it's best to leave it at the edge and ""tunnel"" with OPC-UA.  For example, if there is a legacy app with only an OPC-DA Client interface, you can install a software gateway locally.  On one end of the gateway, the application would connect to OPC-DA Server interface.  On the other end, the gateway's OPC-UA Client interface would connect to an OPC-UA Server across the network.

The name Euromap can be misleading because sometimes it's one of many OPC-UA specs (e.g., 83, 77, 79) , other times it's a flat text file protocol (e.g., 63), and other times it's multi-conductor ""dry contact"" connection (e.g., 67).

Euromap 15 is like an old-school fieldbus spec for injection molding focused MES apps to communicate with machines.  It uses BITBUS for transport.  BITBUS is an RS-485 fieldbus based on ancient IBM networking technology (SDLC).  In other words, it couldn't be anything further from Ethernet or TCP/IP.  You'll need some sort of gateway.

It looks like HARTING offers a Euromap 15 gateway.  Unfortunately, it's not compatible with any of the protocols you cited (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA).  It has a REST server interface.  This makes sense as Euromap 15 is more of a ""method-based"" protocol consisting of request/response telegram messages for specific purposes (e.g., ""What's the job?, ""What's the status?"").  It's not like a ""data access"" style protocol used for the SCADA or telemetry applications often associated with MQTT or OPC-UA.  You could use the HTTP client interface (e.g., ""REST"", ""Web Services"") on something like Ignition, HighByte or Kepware's IoT Gateway to execute calls against the HARTING gateway's REST interface.  The nice part about this approach is that you don't have to bother learning all the Euromap 15 commands and structure.

The other option is to roll your own.  This will require some knowledge of the Euromap 15 structure.  You could purchase an serial gateway device from Real Time Automation or HMS Networks.  These products can be configured basically create your own serial driver.  For example, you might define the structure of a telegram (e.g., header, line feed, carriage return) and then the gateway will parse out the payload for you.  If you already have Windows PCs with serial connections, look into Kepware's U-CON driver.","",""

That's good it's at least encapsulated over TCP/IP.  Serial interfaces are especially a pain with a lot of machines.  Beyond this, if you know the Euromap 15 commands you're after, it should be pretty straightforward.

A proper software gateway (e.g., Kepware) implementation is just as reliable as dedicated hardware gateway.  I would even make the argument that it's even more reliable because it's easier to maintain and lifecycle.  Kepware is a service and should be deployed on a server.  A server will be stable and managed as such.  It's not going to be a GPO guinea pig or break after patch Tuesday.  Policies designed for the laptop of the gullible employee opening emails from Nigerian princes are going to be different than for a server.  I'd recommend discussing this distinction with your IT department.

Do you need broad protocol support?  Software gateways tend to have more drivers.  Hardware gateways tend to focus on only the very most popular devices (e.g., Rockwell, Siemens, Modbus).  Maple Systems is a notable exception to this.

Do you have a lot of devices?  Software gateways tend to scale up much easier.  The cost of hardware gateways adds up quickly.  A handful of premium hardware gateways can cost about the same as Kepware deployment with a driver suite, plugins, etc.  This doesn't include the cost of installing hardware gateways.  At a certain point, it comes very obvious where the cost advantage is.

What does of edge of network mean to you?  Is the edge 1-2 hops from a network core with multi-gig uplinks?  Or, is it traversing a constrained WAN or cellular network?  If there is a constrained network or lack of network, a hardware gateway with pub/sub may work out best.  On the other hand, bigger plants to tend to have network infrastructure in place.  In these plants, the term ""edge"" may be more a physical than a topological or performance distinction.  For example, there may not be significant difference in performance between deploying a gateway in a machine panel next a PLC vs on a central server.  Both scenarios may handle a 100ms poll/response just fine.","","üëç (3)"

The manufacturing suite, which includes drives for nearly any PLC, is about $4k.  This is low enough that it would make it hard to justify processor updates solely for protocol support.  It would be worthwhile if it were part of a holistic modernization strategy that would involve rebuilding the programs in TIA Portal to enable other outcomes.

Kepware does not support PROFINET or PROFIBUS because these are not ""vanilla"" Ethernet or Serial protocols.  That is, they require special hardware with an ASIC to interface with.  They bypass the typical OSI stack of technologies in TCP/IP and RS-485 based protocols.  As a result, conventional PC and networking hardware can't connect to it.  But, this shouldn't be a problem because PROFINET and PROFIBUS are generally not intended for this.  They're intended to be a deterministic fieldbus for field devices (e.g., I/O, Motion, Safety).

Generally, one is not going to use the fieldbus (e.g., PROFIBUS, PROFINET) to access the memory tables on a Siemens S7 device from a SCADA or IIoT infrastructure.  They're going to use the native S7 protocol (RFC 1006).  This is actually the underlying protocol used in Kepware's Siemens TCP/IP driver.  Basically, every S7-300 or newer with an Ethernet interface supports this.  The only issues you might have is with an S7-300 without an Ethernet port.  You can purchase an Ethernet module for it.  This will add native S7 protocol support.  Or, if you can't add an Ethernet module, you can connect an external gateway to the PROFIBUS interface that does (among other things).

Options for retrofitting an S7-300 w/o an Ethernet interface:

One of the biggest differences between using a newer S7 processor with Kepware's drivers vs other options (e.g., S7-300, Ignition's Siemens drivers) is the automatic tag generation.  This automatically pulls in the tags through the native Siemens S7 protocol.  This is preferable to maintaining a list of tag names, memory register addresses, and datatypes.

Typically, the IIoT system is seen more as the enterprise system that is there to provide a return on investment, while the SCADA system is there to handle the critical applications in the plant.  Also, having everything run through a Level 0 <-> Cloud architecture is going to end up causing issues, especially in the case that you mentioned about the stop button (even worse, what happens if the connection is down at that moment?).  Ideally, you want to have some edge-level system that can act as a filter between the decisions that need to be made on the plant floor and the information that needs to be passed along.

Right now, the EK9160 is our master exposing the data over OPC UA. Rather than going into the webGUI to configure each of the slaves for settings different than default, I'd rather have that within our own configuration file that gets backed-up and is under revision control.

It could also be a reduction in cost, as the EK1100 is cheaper than an EK9160.  I suspect that any additional Beckhoff software licensing won't save us money than what we are doing today...

I wonder why there is no USB adapter. Most EtherCAT is 100Mbps, which would handle the low-level, fast moving EtherCAT traffic (without burdening the CPU) then should be able to have some virtual UART interface for the software to get the data, which shouldn't be an issue even for USB2 at 480Mbps.  Having a USB would also alleviate the need to have low-level drivers in the OS (like WinPcap). Having a LAN adapter could be better as that would let the application reside within a docker container.

Even Hilscher has this device:

This is a big problem with industrial automation.  One can back up the program, but not necessarily the configuration.  Doing a simple update to a node on a field network requires someone in-the-know.  A GUI doesn't abstract the complexity away if one is not a subject matter expert and disciplined to track/document changes.

My understanding of TwinCAT is that the runtime is licensed, but the IDE and associated services are not.  I was curious if these EtherCAT network config settings were exposed via the ADS interface.  Or, if the IDE could manage the settings and somehow be exposed as a service to your application.

I wonder if the issue might be EtherCAT.  Because it requires an ASIC, it will drive up cost and limit its audience and even further drive up cost.  Does your application benefit from EtherCAT's performance?  Could you get away using the same kind of field devices with EtherNet/IP?  This opens up a ton of ""hardware-less"" possibilities.  

That's a good question about USB.  Throughput should be no problem.  Perhaps it's a determinism or implementation issues.  Usually, with fieldbus stuff, OEMs aren't looking for a mainstream OS like Windows.  It's more licensing cost and bloat.  It's going to be implemented for more specialized embedded systems at the firmware-level or for an RTOS.

It doesn't surprise me the Hilscher interfaces cost more than a complete product with the interfaces.  I would check if HMS Networks has anything.  I wonder if you could have RTA build something for you.","",""

The EK9160 is a fantastic device in that it is an EtherCAT master and offloads the polling of the slaves from the PC and does the polling as fast as it is able.  Since EtherCAT is a poll/response architecture, that is a lot of processing for not much benefit if the values are not changing.  Then the EK9160 is also an OPC UA server that allows subscribing to only the data of interest, setting up the desired publish rate, setting up deadbands on analog values, and all this over TCP/IP which is typical for operating systems (no special low-level Ethernet drivers required).

A USB EtherCAT adapter could do something similar, and not require the PC to have a dedicated Ethernet port for EtherCAT.  I assume the LAN adapter from Hilscher is for the same purpose.

All the benefits I listed above for the EK9160 is why a USB EtherCAT would be better than a generic USB Ethernet dongle. It offloads the full poll/response stack from the application/PC, and the application can subscribe to a stream of exactly the data that it wants, each of which would have filters on it like deadbands, rather than getting all the EtherCAT data and having to filter thorough it itself.

All of this together keeps the bandwidth/processing minimized for the application, and would not require a special licensed EtherCAT Master software with special Ethernet drivers to allow applications to bypass the TCP/IP stack typical of Windows. The cost of the hardware would be the license.

One of the issues with power monitoring is that it can require A LOT of analog inputs.  Most IO gateway products on the market severely lack analog inputs.  And, with PLCs, analog input cards can be quite costly.  Beckhoff is a good solution because the backplane modules are universal across their portfolio and there are few limitations in their use.  This allows one to build a ""dense"" gateway full of analog inputs or power monitoring modules.  This is preferable to buying more gateways based on the inputs that are available.  Also, using an IoT ""bus coupler"" instead of a processor designed for machine control can help reduce cost.

Another solution is to use IO-Link.  IFM offers an analog input modules, DP2200 and DP1222, that can be connected to an IO-Link Master.  These can be quite economical relative to traditional analog input cards.  These input modules can be connected to widely-available analog current/voltage sensors.  By converting the analog signal to IO-Link, it provides quite a bit of flexibility.  IO-Link works over unshielded M12 cables.  This reduces the amount of interference and shielded cables.  It allows the gateway (aka IO-Link Master) to be located further away from the sensors.  This can be particularly useful for monitoring dispersed power infrastructure (e.g., switch gear, bus bar) or brownfield assets where 24VDC or PoE may not be present.

IFM's IO-Link Masters have MQTT and various fieldbus interfaces.  For MQTT, data comes in as basic JSON payloads.  This will likely require the use of some form of ""DataOps"" to build structure and context (e.g., three phase, units of measure, asset, area).  While it may sound like nuisance to introduce a PLC and fieldbus into this, IFM maintains a really nice set of programming libraries (e.g., Function Block, AOI) to decode the IO-Link payloads.  Using a central PLC as gateway to decode IO-Link and build context could be an option as well.","","üëç (1)"

When integrating machines into our Industry 4.0 platform, we often need variable lists from unknown S7-300/400 PLCs. This information is buried in the STEP 7 project file - which is often only available to the machine manufacturer and not shared with the customer. Furthermore, STEP 7 has no 1-click way of just exporting a variable list to CSV.

To solve these problems, we have written the ENLYZE S7-Project-Explorer. It's a standalone tool to open a STEP 7 (.s7p) project file, browse through all variables from symbol lists and data blocks, and save a complete list as a CSV file. No STEP 7 installation or license is required for that!
This tool has been successfully used at ENLYZE and our partners for the past 2 years. We made the experience that machine manufacturers gladly use it and send us CSV files, even when they are reluctant to provide the .s7p project file.

In order to make this frequent problem a no-brainer for even more people, we have just released the S7-Project-Explorer as a free download, including the full source code on GitHub.
We hope the tool is as useful to you as it is to us! üôÇ

IO-Link solves the analog and rtd module problem well.  Most of the major sensor manufacturers have already had some sort of transducer and basic signal processing embedding into their sensors for years.  They were converting that to a ""dumb"" digital (e.g., 0-24VDC) or analog (e.g., 4-20mA, 0-10VDC) signal for a PLC to consume.  With IO-Link, it's like hooking up a serial connection over a standard cable to that ""brain"" inside the sensor.  It negates the need for input cards, backplanes, panel space, shielded cables, scaling, etc.

Even if you can't find a thermal sensor with IO-Link your application, you'll likely achieve higher input density and better economics using a conventional sensor with an analog-to-IOL interface.

For clarity I have roughly 225 tanks with temperature controls. 150 are only cooled, and 75 have heating and cooling. Almost all the temperature controllers are ancient omron E5CN controllers with no connectivity. Even if they did have pins for RS485 comms the proprietary software for these old controllers isn‚Äôt available. From what I read the 485rtu protocol doesn‚Äôt play nice either‚Ä¶ Each tank has a PT100  rtd. There aren‚Äôt currently any temperature sensors on the sub-loops that pick up groups of tanks for a given area. The boilers (4) work together to feed the heating loop but only measure temperature coming out of and into the skid. The chillers (3) work independently to cool 3 separate loops throughout the facility, but again only capture temperature data immediately coming and going from each chiller respectively. I would like to capture temperature data on the supply and return of all the sub-loops so that I can actuate the bypass valve on any given sub-loop. That way dormant loops aren‚Äôt falling way out of spec. Say for example a cellar hand fills a tank with red grapes to start a fermentation. If the loop temperature has normalized to room temperature due to not running, the boilers are taxed for no good reason because the return water is coming back at 10-20 degrees Celsius instead of 70+. Right now the SCADA that runs the boilers and chillers it totally disconnected from everything they are heating and chilling. Step one is a plan to collect and map all the cellar data, then create a new SCADA that encompasses all the data.","",""

Each machine network is a flat VLAN, typically on a 192.168 subnet. Also, there is the strong possibility that these 192.168 subnets have overlaps. So its not feasible to connect all these machine networks together through a managed switch.

You could try where each machine network is a separate VLAN on the switch, but don't know how a switch would handle a multi-VLAN access port for the PC wanting to talk to the machines, especially with the potential for overlapping subnets.

So the next idea is to use a double-NAT device, one per machine network, which would translate the local machine network to a common subnet that the PC would use to avoid any duplicates on the machine network. For a small number of machine networks, this could be ok, but it doesn't scale well.

So, my idea is to have a 24-port managed switch with a single-VLAN access port assigned for each machine network. One of the ports will be a trunk port to the FlexEdge. The FlexEdge can configure virtual IPs for each VLAN.

Equipment vendors embed 100's of man-years of valuable development (Bottom Up) within their equipment, dictate to you about 1 of 4 network proliferations (from what I've assessed) that you have to harmonize w/ site (Top Down).

In imperfect attempts to solve, I've been involved w $50 Edge Routers (i.e. NAT), to abandoning 1/2 the data w/ OPC UA DA, to the dreaded OSI Pi tunneller app, to flattening network, forcing  vendor to take on a L2/L3 Cisco Industrial Switch retrofitted in field for enterprise management of such, to forcing their OT Equipment (in production) to be Patched in a security hardening dance (add 30 weeks to and 2 lawyers to that dance).  

Although IMO, what you have looks like more of a top down approach vs. bottom up.  While I'm definitely biased towards bottoms up / subsidiarity in technology, business, and society, I like the thought process.  I have NFI what FlexEdge is - need to get smarter on it - thx for introducing.  I also wonder is there a edge convergence play possible to solve the equipment harmonization.

That L2NAT can then provide the L3 switch a new VLAN which has all the devices on the same network (avoiding duplicate IPs).

- Weidmuller IE-CS-2TX-1RS232/485, Serial to Ethernet converter, I used python libraries: pyserial (rs232) and pymodbus (rs485), this worked well, as I could have 1 master computer connect to multiple of these converters, only downside was it was not self-contained, and I could not get Ignition Ethernet/Modbus to collect data from through it, perhaps Serial/Modbus would work with Ignition Edge, but didn't test it.
- OMRON CP2E, small PLC, worked very well with both RS232/RS485, only challenges are you will needed to build the logic to run the serial sequencies, I was not however parsing the data in the PLC, more of using it as a remote interigator, data can be collected from the device in many way, e.g. openly through OMRON TCP/FINS protocal, Ignition and Kepware both have this driver, also there are several free libraries you could use if you wanted to write some code.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1),üëç (2)"

We would like to deploy (probably) label printers for the shop floor that spits out the same thing when the operator presses a button. The use case is that they are working on a confection line and putting the produced stuff into boxes. We need the labels for the boxes with basic info like item name, measures and how many pieces of stuff is in there. The products might be changing multiple times a day, so we would like to publish the data (new label content) to the printer as well. 

We don't know the solution yet, but we are looking at many options currently. We might buy a printer with ethernet connection, plus we need a server (mqtt client, printer driver running in the same linux environment and some ""gateway"" app that can transform the data to a print file(?) that the printer could use, than we hope the printer has some functionality to retain the print file until a new one is given)

How would you solve that in terms of technology and architecture? I'm open to any suggestions.","",""

For some background, I downloaded Node-RED onto my Raspberry Pi yesterday. This was my first experience with it I am also getting used to using SSH and a headless Linux.


About 10 years ago, I integrated the Ion 7650 power meter into a Siemens S7-1200 PLC many times, so  I am familiar with that Modbus map. I downloaded the Modbus map pdf. I pasted the Modbus map into Chat GPT and asked for a JSON output to allow me to create a Node-RED flow that could read from Modbus and publish to a MQTT broker. I then imported the JSON.

I encountered a few issue that required debugging.  I did have to ask Chat GPT how to use the debugger. Here's what we had to address:

1) I needed to add the Modbus modules to Node-RED. Chat GPT guided me through this process.
2) The JSON created a Modbus block that was looking for register 40010 using FC4. I had to change it to use FC3 and start at 0010. My modbus knowledge helped here, but I was able to get good advise by posing the hexadecimal communication messages from ModbusSlave.
3) The scaling block operates directly on the msg.payload.data object within Node-RED. However, we discovered that your msg.payload didn't include this data. I asked Chat GPT for advice on what to do, which involved pasting the message from the debugger. and the data was in the msg.payload object . I'm not 100% sure what that last bit means, but Chat GPT gave me a new script to cut and paste into node red.

It took me about 3 hours of work, and that included downloading ModbusSlave from WinTech to simulate my Power meter.

Without chat GPT, I'd still be reading the manual, or watching some videos, and probably know less about node-red","","üî• (2),üëç (2)"

In the Allen Bradley Logix platform, there is a way to access the controller model and firmware version information programmatically and store it in a tag. This can be achieved using the Controller Properties and System Tags.
To access the controller model, you can use the Controller Properties, specifically the ""CatalogNumber"" property. This property contains the model number of the controller. You can read this property and store the value in a tag of your choice.
Here's an example ladder logic code snippet in RSLogix 5000 programming software:
1. Add an ""XIC"" (Examine If Closed) instruction and enter ""System.CatalogNumber"" as the tag to monitor.
2. Connect the ""XIC"" instruction to an ""OTL"" (Output Latch) instruction and specify the tag where you want to store the controller model information.
3. After executing the code, the tag you specified in the ""OTL"" instruction will contain the model number of the controller.
Similarly, to retrieve the firmware version information, you can use the System Tags. The firmware version is available in the ""System.FirmwareVersion"" tag. You can read this tag and store the value in a separate tag.
Remember to create the appropriate tags and configure the ladder logic to read the Controller Properties and System Tags. Additionally, the specific syntax and available tags may vary depending on the Logix PLC model and the version of the programming software you are using. It's always recommended to consult the product documentation and programming software's user manual for precise details.","",""

I don't blame our marketing team they are great people. It is difficult to convey being all things to all people. 

I joined this group because I think most people don't really understand SIE. If you take more than a passing glance to understand what it is, you wouldn't compare it to Ignition Edge, or SCADA. They aren't the same thing. You install Ignition Edge (or if you want better WinCC OA IOT Suite) on SIE. Factory floors are alive and constantly change. Think about SIE as the devops tool for the OT world. Control your system through scripting with IECTL Manage users/roles by connecting your IEM to your MS-AD. Use the relay server to connect to devices across your network. Use Siemens apps if you wish, or bring/build your own. A fan of Node-Red. It runs natively on SIE.

As a large facility operator, SIE should be what you require your contract engineering companies to develop on. The basis of your playground when you are trying to test. Consider trying to install ML/AI across your factory but not slow cloud AI that has high latency. Want a vision system inspecting my PCBs before I solder them, use SIE. Want a python script to do some work, use SIE. Found an opensource docker app tested it and need to deploy 500 copies use SIE. How many black boxes do you need? How are you going to support and maintain them? Don't want physical black boxes but need something simpler than K8s, run the virtual edge device on your ESXi server.

As I said, Siemens tries to be all things to all people, in this case it forced SIE to be broken down into small pieces. This means that you can tailor an edge device to solve a multitude of single scenarios or group apps and solve several scenarios with a single device. 

It can be helpful to think of scenarios, but don't lock into the scenarios because at the end of the day, SIE is there for you to bring the power of docker on the edge device. The documentation is there for you to tie your apps to the Siemens apps if you want or ignore them completely. You're not stuck using just prebuilt apps or devices.

1) Collect, organize, store and/or forward data.
      S7, EI/P, Modbus, SQL, etc. allow you to collect data from a multitude of systems. This data can be sent into the application we call Industrial Information Hub(IIH).
      The IIH essentials allows you to aggregate the data and makes this aggregation of data available via RestAPI and forward the data from a child edge device to a parent or into our applications Insights Hub or Senseye. At this time Azure requires pushing the data to MQTT before going to the cloud breaking the feature to update the asset model in the cloud from the                 edge device. (We are working on a better solution). For AWS, Snowflake runs on SIE.
      The IIH Semantics allows you to build an asset model and publish the live data to the OPC Server and a GraphQL interface. You can use a free tool such as SIOME to create an OPC UA Namespace or you can roll your own with the built in editor. Once the model exists, connect your data or create equations from multiple tags.

Add applications like Performance Insights, Energy Manager or Machine Monitor and quickly create dashboards/reports/notifications for things like OEE, Sankey diagrams and lifetime cycle counts. If you want to ensure your line is running optimally, take the time to build out Performance Analytics inside of performance insights and zero in on where your line has unnecessary stoppage.
3) ML monitoring motor torque.
      Using the app Drive System Framework, you can extract high(8khz)/low speed(100msec) torque data from your Siemens S120 drive This data can be fed across MQTT to the application named Anomaly Detection where you have the ability to monitor the stream of data for errors.
4) AI vision - connect IP cameras to the vision connector to stream into the AI inference server (take your created AI model using your favorite AI framework such as Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe, Amesim, PyTorch and run it inside the inference server directly on the edge device)
5) Execute a digital twin. An engineer built a model in Matlab to simulate a process, why leave it in the lab. Run in directly on the edge device with live data from the PLC.
6) The Virtual PLC is a 1517 PLC that I can run on a virtual edge device on my ESXi server. I get that you might think of that as a strange use case, but when I turn on the fault tolerance capabilities of vSphere, maybe I just created an invincible PLC using IT tools? (Currently we don't support technology objects, and safety is coming too.)
7) Want Low Code... Use Mendix. https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-app-on-industrial-edge/

Because their TAM is larger and extends beyond a SCADA market, I would imagine they have larger labs and teams to work on this stuff than others.

I can see why SI- and OT-type personas prefer monolithic solutions and to limit the number of line items in a project though.  They're more price sensitive and need every bit of margin.  I still think there is a lot of value to decoupling device connectivity / protocol conversion in architecture.  This is something that, in my opinion, is more stable and should not need to be upgraded as frequently as data infrastructure and application nodes.","",""

Aside from the lack of a Fanuc Focas driver, the hard part of switching to ignition for me would be that I have to manually configure everything in Ignition. 

Going down the ignition route, I would rather configure everything programmatically in Kepware and connect Kepware to Ignition.

It also the reason I stick with Rockwell. I can generate a PLC import file and accompanying tag import file in under 30 seconds and have that downloaded to the PLC in minutes.

I never here anyone proposing HighByte--[OPC-UA]-->Kepware--[OPC-UA] -->PLC

 and of course there are cases where Kepware makes sense,Yes I can connect to more things, with Kepware, and it is more performant, and if it is needed to support certain usecases absolutly go for it,. But I think for a lot of manufacturing plants it is not worth the additional cost.

In a Hub and Spoke approach Kepware can function as that Central Hub.

[ Ignition ] - [ PLC ]
[ [Perspective] - [Tag Namespace] - [OPC UA Client] - [OPC UA Server] - [Core Drivers] ] -- [ PLC ]

While it's one thing to buy and one thing to install, it's not exactly one thing to maintain and troubleshoot. It's like SAP. It's not just one application or service.  What one thinks they're upgrading could have an impact to other things. There are nuances.

In practice, I would say it's a greater risk concentrating all of the solutions into one component set. For example, does one want to disturb and validate all the connections coming into the Core Drivers module when they really just need to patch the Perspective module?  I think the money is well spent to have architectural flexibility to decouple connectivity and application nodes. But, if an SI is working on point solutions for an individual plant, this added cost and complexity may not be beneficial. The buyer may be less interested in architecture than solving a specific problem.  They may not care about these features.

I have actually seen versions of what you described with HighByte. I've seen it done to normalize data collection among both native and OPC UA based PLCs. Sometimes this is done because a SCADA may have been on a separate network and it was desirable to limit the number of connections traversing networks. It's been done to leave OPC classic nodes on the edge. I've also seen people aggregate connections into one hub and securely publish out via MQTT to another hub on a different network. Additionally, sometimes it's more productive to scale data acquisition within a single, aggregated OPC UA namespace. For example, one could leverage a pattern in the ERP or CMMS to drive a parameterized subset within OPC UA identifiers (e.g., Asset_ID).

At some point, when solutions are running production critical workloads, they'll be running on managed infrastructure. Whether on one host or many, it should not impact availability.","","üëç (1)"

I used a similar approach with Maria DB with stored procedures to store and then pull from above, not push. Worked well but crazy handling of data. Then started to use Kafka.

It sounds like you started on the wedge approach already. There is data acquisition solved with a keyboard wedge or serial interface. They either collect data continously or with a trigger (e.g., foot switch, button). The major gauge vendors (e.g., Mitutoyo, Mahr, Starett) will have their own and there are vendor solutions like ASDQMS. These solve the data acquisition problem, but not the transaction problem. They don't account for state, metadata, human error, intent, etc. They just blindly capture data. These need some front end or application to facilitate a transaction. This will decouple acquiring data vs logging the data as transaction. Some QMS or SPC apps will have some functionality for logging inspection results. It will often consist of a form with the inspection content or even instructions. The data can collected into that form, verified it was collected correctly (and any other business logic), and then submitted to be logged. Alternatively, you could build something like this in a platform like Tulip or Mendix. So, by having an app, this solve the transactional problem and will enforce data quality.","",""

The software part varies by industry and what you're seeking to measure. Sometimes it's called gage, testing, or lab software. Since you appear to be doing metrology, something like Orbit Gauge Software (fka GageSoft) would probably work. DataMyte, Marposs, National Instruments, etc have solutions as well. These apps will have a front end to facilitate the transaction but also will have drivers for measurement instrumentation (e.g., LVDT probes, transducers). They also have the capable of performing calculations (e.g., runout, flatness, least squares) for more sophisticated readings. They have their own backend database and reporting. They also can produce text files or will have some communication protocols support to interface with other systems. Sometimes the software is used as standalone testing solution and other times it is used apart of a broader automated inspection solution with PLCs. Other use cases may be less demanding from a metrology/math standpoint and can be a PLC without the software. The probes will be connected to the PLC‚Äôs fieldbus or analog inputs. These are typically used in custom built fixtures and gages. A metrology lab or gage manufacturing shop can produce turn key systems.

The key takeaway should be that blindly collecting data will lead to problems. There needs to be some amount of intelligence on the edge whether that is a software, PLC, or a front end interface to enforce the business process and ‚Äúgatekeep‚Äù the noise.","",""

This takes a ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù approach to data collection which is generally not desirable for inspection transactions. Unless the destination system is like enforcing a FMEA / Control Plan and is expecting inspection results (on an event or time interval basis), it‚Äôs leaving a lot to chance. Having error handling and a process to guarantee the data was read in and logged correctly is really important.

A good CMM program will have prompts for operator to choose options to determine the metadata about what's being inspected. These might be read in through a script or fixed values in the program. In the past, I've built simple console applications to process the resulting text files and publish the data to an API endpoint. Usually, CMM's text files had enough data to create a ""healthy"" transaction.

With gaging, if it's manual or semi-automated process, humans can be a major factor. Thsi is often overlooked. Having a front end is pretty important. A well-programmed automated solution will typically have states (e.g., production mode, debug mode, calibration mode) that help filter ""noise"". 

CMMs are more precise, can measure more sophisticated features, can calculate measurements for sophisticated GD&T callouts (e.g., concentricity), and generally used to ""certify"" more low-volume, bespoke products (e.g., tooling, gage, aerospace component). CMMs are generally in a metrology lab.

Gages are generally less precise, but far lower cost and can generally inspect in greater volume. They're commonly used as ""relative"" feedback about a process and where to target it. Gages can be in a metrology lab and/or used apart of the production process.

Sometimes CMMs can be used as a additional inspection layer for gages. They function as a secondary check ensure there is correlation.","","üôè (1),üëç (1)"

A good machine with a native communication protocol is better than a bad machine with an IIoT protocol. Use integrated safety and motion wherever possible. Use mainstream control platforms your org is familiar with, can hire/train for, can source equipment with, etc. Northbound connectivity should be secondary criteria to this. It's not hard to add gateways later. It's much harder to fix automation shortcomings later.

Suppose there are two choices. The first is a Groov EPIC with Ignition Edge running on it, but there is a separate safety relay and motors are controlled with discrete i/o. The second is a Compact GuardLogix with CIP Motion and CIP Safety peripherals implemented. I'll take the second option every time. The alternative, if lucky, is connecting to and managing data silos across 3+ controllers. If not lucky, the data is vague or missing all together. This is not to say the Groov EPIC is bad by any means. I think it's a great solution. Personally, I'd rather compromise on out-of-box IIoT support than automation. Having a proper fieldbus and a holistic approach to control and alarming makes all the difference. Downstream, the data will be so much easier to use and create value with.

""Door 4 opened during cycle"" is better than ""MCR_FAULT""
""Conveyor 3 VFD at 7.6A load and 50 RPM"" is better than ""CONVEYOR_ON""
""Braking transistor/chopper circuit failure"" is better than ""MOTOR_FAULT""
""Encoder overspeed at position x = 900.3"" is better than ""SERVO_FAULT""

It's hard to do useful analysis or predictions on vague booleans.

If a safety event occurs in the factory where you need to prove that your safety system has not changed, you may be SOL.

With their GuardLogix design, Rockwell has clearly favored Integrators over end users, as the likelihood of the safety signature changing for a non-safety reason is high, thus all but eliminating any liability from system integrators. 

A better architecture is to separate safety and process, such as adding a Pilz or Sick safety controller connected to the PLC using a fieldbus of your choice. These devices are better at managing the safety signature, even sometimes having safety signatures for different modules in the code. 

 It's more effort up front to not have it all in one device, but if you are ever deposed by lawyers you'll be glad you have safety signatures you can depend on.","","üëç (4),üî• (1)"

I am struggling on how to approach this data modeling problem so maybe someone who has much more experience can help me understand how to overcome this. So i have a couple of edge nodes where i run different containers like ignition where i am simulating different machines and al of this is for learning purposes. Now i am simulating different machines just as you would have on the production floor and all of these machines have different amount of tags available so for the sake of complexity each machine is different in one way or the other.

Quickly i found out that i probably need some common data model for all my assets because it can become overly complicated to maintain otherwise and maybe then i could built additional UDTs on top of that model, right? Just brainstorming haha.

How would this common data model look like if i want to model data at the edge?
Is data modeling at the edge something that we will see more in the future and is this decentrialized architecture good or bad? 
Do we have any exemples or does ignition exchange can provide any exemple projects?
Is it best to have mqtt broker at each edge node and then send data to the plant level broker and then cloud or what are you running at the edge?

Maybe i am overcomplicating this but it would be interesting to see how are you or even if are you doing any edge modeling/computing?","",""

In long - the Enron driver has a customizable address range table where register sizes, data types and function codes can be assigned to given register ranges. The available range is 0 thru 65535. You can mix types and function codes and sizes as long as your assigned ranges don‚Äôt overlap.

This may be more info than you need, but some additional context: A classic Modbus driver from Kepware with a ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù model selected actually supports 1/2/3/4/5 digit Modbus addresses from 0 to 65535 with the additional digit - for us at least - always a leading digit and just a means to convey the Modbus memory type, like 465535 where 4 indicates Holding Register memory. The Enron driver‚Äôs flexibility comes in because 1) the classic Modbus drivers‚Äô generic model register sizes are fixed at 16 bits rather than Enron/Daniels native of 32 bits, and 2) because the classic Modbus drivers‚Äô sub models like Daniels, while they support 32 bit single registers, have small fixed address ranges well below 65535. These are ranges typical in early Daniel devices and once we added the Enron driver and built it out with features, it put downward pressure on us to greatly enhance these sub models for the other Modbus drivers.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

This is the Setup,

I pull data from a windfarm using a PLC to PLC connection. (The windfarm has S7 PLC's connected to Modbus TCP Power meters and Modbus Serial Protection realys)
and that turn the Beacon on an off to indicate that cheap power is available
There is also a Intessis OCPP to Modbus converter to pull data from the Charging Station.

There are then three different routes done for testing 
1- the CC716 can pull data via Modbus, S7 or OPCUA and make it available on an OPCUA server or publishing to a MQTT Broker( I would have to check the Sparkplug capabilities(no Modbus RTU)
2. The Wago PLC can communicate to the  three Devices Via Modbus 
3, the IIoT 2050 can pull the data directly from the three devices two.( Support Modbus RTU as well 

the CC716 provides really great segregation between the Device Layer and the ""Cloud Layer""( Here the Cloud layer is VLAN 2) If I was connecting from site to the Cloud directly that would be my choice, especially as I deal with a lot of siemens, but no onsite compute of visualisation. And it is a bit pricey

the WAGO is nice and light for situations where I need some IO and some Modbus comms, it's a nice solution. If I was better with Codesys, it could be really great. I would love to get this working a bit better

But the IOT 2050 is the winner for this use case as I need to provide the Dashboards locally on site, and I have all the data being logged to Timescale

We plan to look up an API to get the live power data.

and the Client can subscribe to the Broker to log any data to their PI system

Going forward the plan is to get the telemetry data from the Vessel( a high speed electric ferry) that the Charger is powering.

If we look at additional site, it will probably be just the IOT2050,","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336217580765245/1374356413031120907/image.png?ex=68df1267&is=68ddc0e7&hm=ad629b3a907f2a2ec19394d3784c0eccb342f9f8842cc4f9f71c03068b7f65c5&","üî• (2)"

I'm working in the company that is slowly implementing UNS in one of our customers. I'm currently on IIot Pro. I watched the Edge Workshop from Trent Christoper but I still got some puzzles missing.

I still have some (probably stupid) questions.

We have following setup: 
- EMQX broker in the main company server room
- one instance of Ignition in the main server room for dataops and hosting MES system

We want to connect to the legacy equipment and send data to broker.

Initially I wanted to go with following setup:
- one industrial PC per line (MOXA DRP-C100) with installed Ignition Edge. This will talk to all PLC's on line and send data to broker via SparkplugB.

But than comes KEPServerEX...

Is only difference between KEPServerEX and Ignition Edge list of drivers? I can see that KEPServerEX has Telemecanique Uni-Telway driver while Ignition don't.

Is it good idea to use one KepserverEX per line to collect data from devices and then fetch it using OpcUA by Ignition Edge and send it to broker? Maybe one KepserverEX per multiple lines? Or initial setup is fine and Telemecanique Uni-Telway can be handeled in different way.","",""

I tend to favour the concept of a Production Network ,which includes the PLCS et but also the servers that host the MES etc. good governance at a network level in relation to Segmentation and VLAN in in particular, as well as managing open ports, but really I am more concerned about managing the security to keep the outside world away from the production. so using MQTT from Production out to the Corporate or Cloud network . then I see that security advantage come into play. massively.

I am not sure the securing the Edge to Server connection in a Plant where I am responsible for both is a massive security risk.  I am much more concerned in managing how data connects to the Production Network. Also if I want to connect form the Edge to the Cloud I would favour MQTT( with TLS).

Opening Port 102 from your Server to the PLC, Is that really a material risk. You will probably want to open it to allow access to program the PLC or Screens for changes anyway.

As for scalability, if your machines at the edge are all homogenous then having a edge device that you can use as a pattern an add to each machine is great. so if you have a fleet management solutions that works, If you need to map all the S7 Datablocks to OPC anyway, I don't thing there is that much of a scalability issue to be honest.","","üëç (1)"

Depending on the controller, the application, the other tags communicating, and possibly the scan ti.e requirements 14,700 words may or may not be a heavy load. That said, when I did it, it was PLC logic to package everything into a clean data structure (usually in an AB Control or Compact Logix - into an Array of  UDTs nested into another UDT that had the handler tags) with a Boolean Trigger set by the PLC and Reset by the Data Gateway. Later versions added some more tags for troubleshooting like string representations of timestamps and such.

Over different projects and requirements, the data gateway was Ignition, Node-Red, and Factory Talk View SE. 

Having the data split between multiple PLCs puts a bit of a wrench, but depending on more specifics, I could see that being PLC to PLC or both PLCs to Data Gateway.... Likely both as you have drawn but I try to limit the number of different connections to PLCs when possible.

Also depends on how linked things are and if timestamps could be reconciled later or not... If we have shared IDs between PLCs or not and things like that.

The only real identifier for the data is the serial number....which comes from a different PLC than the data, of course you could use time....but then you have to assume a time stamp window to pair the data together.

We discussed just using the existing Ethernet/IP link to bring all of the data together into one plc....passing the SN over, for a single source device.  However, in many real world applications, we may not have access to modify these links and add more code. Also noting that the effort that is required is a barrier to accomplishing the goal and moving quickly....because these types of things are secondary to production....and once you edit code, you own the whole thing....are reasons that engineers resist taking on these changes.

Also in your example, you assumed that you have the ability to identify the length of data to be moved to the DB based on the data block, looking for the first 0 perhaps.....but in my application there is an allocated ""stack"" of 14700 words that never gets cleared...only overwritten....and the only way to identify the size for certain, is to read the qty from the PLC managing the ""stack"" of data.

Never did get into Omron PLCs at all myself yet. 

And yeah, that serial number being in a PLC, especially a separate PLC complicates things for sure.

In my examples, we built in the ways to identify when we buffered the data in the PLC.  Sometimes 0s sometimes incremental integer IDs (that rolled over), sometimes clearing between batches. Etc.

We always added code when it got this complex, but it was always separate and on top of the existing production code in a way that ensured it was read only not write, the concern was really about affecting scan times for processes that were already pretty tight.

we are looking for a scalable modern edge solution that can scale to over a 100 sites .

Our requirements are 

- southwards OPCUA, MQTT, Modbus TCP, Siemens stack, Beckhoff ADS 
- transform messages to certain structure
- northwards publish via MQTT to a central Broker
- mangaged centrally (RBAC, Config..)
- already somewhat proven in industrial setups


Deployment architecture should be modern ‚Äì either bare metal and containerized setups (linux).

The challenge is that we dont have a lot of datapoints per plant (average 100 but will grow in future ) and to get proper pricing to start can be very difficult. 

We are currently looking at 2 different products  : 

- Litmus (looks best) but pricing is very high as we can not seem to find the right pricing structure for us
- Kepware incl Kepware+ -> still in middleage with its architecture / but is promising linux availabality for most of our drivers next year / pricing is good

We also looked at other stuff like  OPCRouter, Siemens Edge, Edgecentral (EdgexFoundry), German Edge, Node Red (Flowfuse), hivemqedge but all of them were not satisfying

Does anyone have any other suggestions of products that we might have missed?

Thanks, Cheers","",""

Prosys OPC UA Forge conforms to all your requirements: https://prosysopc.com/products/opc-ua-forge/ .
I am assuming that RBAC is Role Based Access Control. Forge supports built-in users or integration with LDAP.  Then address space and Read/Write can be configured for access depending on what user is connected.  In terms of configuration, web-based GUI can be accessed remotely. Configuration can be done also via REST API. So hopefully can conform to this requirement too.

It has flexible licensing: perpetual or subscription based. 
You can stack instances of it in layers - install on eash site, and an aggreator instance in the cloud for central access to all sites.
There is a use case with one of the setups: https://prosysopc.com/cases/from-mtconnect-to-opc-ua-cnc-data-collection-with-forge/
My company is Prosys OPC partner in North America. 
We can also help with hardware/software to install and infrastructure to manage/control all 100 sites remotely.
