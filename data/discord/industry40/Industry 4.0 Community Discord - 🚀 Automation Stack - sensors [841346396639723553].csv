I am working with a client that would like to know when a roller on a conveyor is turning (to detect product movement). They would like to know speed, but state may suffice. The client suggested an encoder which I am working with P+F on, but these require PLC configuration, which I am not familiar with. 

Curious if anyone has any suggestions. I thought about getting some kind of small gear that could be mounted to the roller and they use a photo eye to detect movement/speed. Something that output a current of voltage signal would be preferred. Thoughts?","","üî• (1)"

Another option is to use a photoelectric distance sensor.  You could count the ""jumps"" in displacement.  If the product is length is uniform or there is some indicator mark on the conveyor, it could be used like an encoder.

It needs a bit of standardization and manufacturers need to make it easier to get all the non-process data into your PLC. I think that will come, a lot of vendors already have function blocks for AB, it will just take time for that to make its way to the other PLCs.

A few downsides:
- It's a star topology, you cant daisy-chain sensors. This makes sense for standard analog sensors but not for a digital, sensor. No reason a bus couldn't be have been designed, but IO-Link was originally created for sensor manufacturers to update their settings on their sensors so a base sensor (example proximity sensor) could be tuned to different setting and then be different SKUs
- It's not built in to any PLCs

I think a different sensor bus technology could come along and replace these things. Ideally it would be an open standard and also specify things like standardized connectors (style and pinout) so that we can get closer to having the ""USB of Industrial devices""","","üëç (2)"

It all depends on the use case. The intent of the sensors is to enhance reliability which can be accomplished in several ways. 

If all you want is the data, there are many that will accomplish this. I am most familiar with National Instruments and Erbessd. The later has a number of different sensors that integrate into their visualization package.

The next level uses sensors that incorporate machine learning. These are connected to a cloud backend that provide visualization and alerts for asset health issues. Proaxion, Nikola Labs and Symphony Industrial AI all have good technology. Symphony has the most developed asset models along with the ability to include process data for process health, as well.

There are new technologies on the market that use ML at the edge. Rather than send a bunch of data for analysis, the bulk of it is done at the edge with a backend ML/AI performing additional analysis. The cloud also provides alerts and visualization. I am quite familiar with VIE Technologies for this.

Wireless vibration has become quite popular because it eliminates the need for a vibration technician to spend 20 hours per week gather and analyzing data. The sensors do the bulk of the work which frees up the technician to perform higher value work. Hope this helps.","","üíØ (1)"

Secondly the solutions I have see  the vibration data is available through their app, only we want to integrate into the site scada, gain access to the vibration data for our own analysis, convert to images to allow deep learning etc

Finally, the cost. The scenario we are in is lots of smaller centrifugal and lobe pumps 0-10kw range. Maybe 20 per set. I feel that for a complete solution all the bases need covered give then sensors can be 100 off the shelf to 350 for bespoke installs. The cost will be too great, especially as the entire plant will be completed eventually. 

I am confident I can develop my own system using stmicroelectronics  accelerometers, and  bluetooth gateway on the edge, data then stored in influxdb server and displayed using grafana or similar.","",""

Arduinos are notorious for  s**ting the bed due to serial buffer overflows. It's been a plaguing issue for years. It most often occurs in 2 ways.
1. You're sending Serial.print() statements too quickly. You should ALWAYS be using a non-blocking timing routine for serial prints. A loop on even a crummy, Arduino Uno can still be blazingly fast compared to most PLCs (<1-2 microseconds depending on your code). Usually this acutally leads to your serial monitor on your computer crashing and not the arduino though.
2. You're doing Serial.print()s and you unplug the USB cable. You'd think Arduino would be smart enough to not try to send data over the UART when it's unplugged, but it isn't. Depending on your publish rate, this will eventually cause you to overflow the print buffer and crash the program in fun and exciting ways.

In general, be cautious with Serial prints, they're extremely useful and pretty much the only way to debug an arduino program until you move into realm of debuggers like J-Links but they're a double edged sword. They're very slow and will interfere with the timing of your program.","","üíØ (1),üëç (3)"

They use blocking code, like delay(), exorbitant Serial.print()s, and almost never use good abstraction or error handling practices. It's a good way to see how to interact with a peripheral or library, but copy-pasting the loop() code into your application is probably not going to work long term.","","üíØ (4)"

- Adding BIT/INT/FLOAT to the end of variable name. This is 100% unneeded in a proper IDE (aka, not Arduino IDE) as your editor should tell you what type it is. Worse than that, what if I decide I need to change an INT to a FLOAT? Now I have to update the variable name everywhere it's used? Sure you can use find&replace, but what if you forget or were ""just testing it"" and then get distracted and move on to something else.

- I love that the author recommends containers and separate files instead of one, big, file, but the method for implementing it is very simplistic and isn't true abstraction. It has a dangerous illusion of local variables, but actually requires way to many globals. Instead of setting bits in a container or class, use a functional interface. For example instead of pistonStartBIT, use Piston.Start() (or Piston_Start() if you aren't comfortable with C++ class syntax). True abstraction is a little more complicated than the authors method and can be intimidating for people new to text-based, object oriented languages, but IMHO, it's the only way to write large, robust controls programs.

MBP provides power over the bus safely.  This satisfies requirements in process industries.  PA and DP can adapted with segment couplers.  This is not an uncommon use case.  PI and Siemens have documentation.

PA is far less common than DP.  Regardless, if you can selectively deploy PROFINET in parallel to the existing PROFIBUS infrastructure, it will open up a ton of options.  Figure out what is there because it must be there (e.g., compliance, safety) vs what doesn't have to be there (e.g., tradition).

Most IO-Link Master products focus on IP67 and Ethernet-based fieldbuses.  Because IO-Link came out well into the PROFINET era, PROFIBUS support is somewhat limited.  Check out Balluff or Siemens.  Order soon.  The lead times on this are insane right now.  I believe I've only seen one IFM product with this.  All the more reason to use PROFINET where possible.

This is usually a symptom of the fact that the company doesn't have any proficiency in anything but 4-20mA communications, so putting something different in can be intimidating.  I've seen this with everything from Modbus to Ethernet (seriously dating myself).  Your best bet is to not approach this from a technology standpoint, but from a change management perspective.  Start by describing how awesome their life would be if they made the change, then get the first win.  This may need to  be small, and you may need to essentially give it away to get it in there, but your goal is to put it side by side with the old tech and get them to see the difference and the fact that it will be easy to use.  After that, get the person, or people, from the plant to help you to get that solution into other areas.  Just an FYI, if your blocker (the guy that just doesn't want to make the change) is in a serious place of power, then it will be difficult.  The easiest transitions always have a higher placed person that is receptive to change.

As for benefits, safety is always a big one, especially in the harsher applications (oil and gas).  Newer technologies can mean more reliable signals, and less requirements for maintenance, which means less time for the tech to be in a potentially hazardous area.  Just be ready for the pushback that the thing that is out there is tried and tested and the new tech isn't.","","üíØ (1)"

Each press has top and bottom electric heated platen, and 2 presses share a hydraulic pump which operates the hydraulic ram. 

There are two generations of presses.
The older generation do not have any intelligence. The temperature is controlled by an OMRON E5CSV signaling heating grid relays, Temperature is measured with 2 J type thermocouples, 1 in each platen.
The newer generations are using Automation Direct Productivity1000 for temperature control. It is using 6 J type thermocouples, 3 in each platen.

For the hydraulic system 2 presses share 1 hydraulic pump and reservoir. A toggle switch actuates and electrical control valve to send pressure to the left or right press. A manual directional control valve moves the ram up or down. Pressure 12kpsi

My goal is to find out the best path forward for connecting the machines and getting data out of them. I believe with pressure data I can know when the machine is in a press cycle, and how long it was in the cycle. Can also use this trend line data for pump and ram conditional monitoring for maintenance and replacement. Temperature data is important for us for troubleshooting, and processing.

For a starter kit, it would be odd that they weren't preloaded to work out of the box.  Perhaps you may need to assign a device to each port.

IO-Link sensors and actuators have IODD files to define the payload and meta data.  These get loaded into the Master.  They can obtained from the OEM's site or PI's site.  Alternatively, these can be manually programmed based off an IODD document.  Once these definitions are present, it should possible to assign the ports of the Master to a specific IO-Link Device.  From a PLC or application perspective, some brands even maintain libraries (e.g., Studio 5000 AOI, TIA Portal FB, Ignition) that parse and build out tag structures according to the IODD.

Looking through the Comtrol documentation, it looks like the IODD files need to loaded into their IOLM client.

I demo'd the Comtrol stuff a few years ago.  I liked the fact that it had OPC UA on board, but the rest of the product was kind of clunky.  I didn't like how IP addresses were managed and I also noticed that the web interface was slow.  Ironically, other manufacturers had white labeled some Comtrol models and the implementation was better.  Some of the early IFM IP20 models were physically identical, but used different browser-based software to configure.

For some reason, IO-Link tends to work better over a fieldbus with a PLC as the gateway than it does with an IIoT protocol.  There is less support for applications than PLCs.  The one exception appears to be IFM with what they built out for Ignition.  I've yet to try this though.","",""

And the wiring time savings you are referring to is really just a difference in terminals vs connector based IO (m8/m12), not iolink itself, with the exception being non binary sensors like analog, where the wiring and cabling of traditional methods being very time consuming.

The AHT20 nodes require NodeJS >= 14 and the Rio is still on 12.x, and the contrib-i2c nodes don't detect anything. I'm guessing since it's designed for the RPi that it addresses the I2C hardware directly and is not designed to read over a USB adapter?","",""

The cross-vendor interoperability of IO-Link is defined by the IO Device Description (IODD).  You can use this with any IO-Link device.  Many people actually store the config on a PLC to ""write"" to the device.  This is very useful for replacing a failed sensor without needing to program it.

There are some offerings that go beyond the IO-Link spec.  For example, if you download IFM's ""Start Up Package"" for its masters supporting PROFINET, there are function blocks that can be imported into Siemens TIA Portal to specifically interface with IFM products.  It's like having a driver for the device.  This is in contrast of mapping in and out of a generic IODD structure exchanged over PROFINET.  Additionally, IFM's LR-Device or Moneo software will have libraries, configuration menus, photos, etc of their own sensors.  It's these libraries and applications are what make IO-Link useful as a tech IMO.

It would be nice to see more elegant cross-vendor integrations, but the spec only goes so far and it takes work to maintain those libraries.  At the end of the day, IO-Link is mostly field protocol that connects to devices over a standard M12 cable.  The compute on these devices is often more primitive than what is needed to support TCP/IP Ethernet.  There isn't much room for overhead in the protocol.  It has a simple object model.

I plugged it in, it automatically spun up a WIFI access point at boot, I connected to it and accessed its web UI with a laptop, connected it to a WIFI network, gave it a DHCP static address via opnsense, turned off the access point, put in MQTT broker info, and data was being published. Less than 5 minutes including unboxing, and no mobile app or internet access required. By default it spits out data in the topic root as `shellyplugus-<device>`. I otherwise would have used something external to consume that data then publish it back to the broker where I want it in the UNS, but I was able to use the 'scripting' (javascript-ish...?) functionality to tailor topics and payloads on the device before publishing. I was able to implement RBE, do unit conversions, and add enriching information like timestamps, descriptions, and units of measure. That took about 3 hours, primarily because I don't know what the heck language it is and the documentation on scripting wasn't great. The rest of the documentation was great (especially on the APIs). The only thing I couldn't figure out and will likely be a rabbit hole is converting a unix timestamp to ISO 8601. @MRIIOT In terms of UI and user experience, it might be worth getting one and taking some notes on for the SHARC.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/841346396639723553/1229966829607452703/image.png?ex=68df26df&is=68ddd55f&hm=b05d9f0ebdf09d14fb29208cef6f1c34852691936b6c70c0c4b47795412b80ea&","üíØ (2),üëç (3)"

There is a many to many relationship between languages and compilers/interpreters, but much more limited compatibility between compilers/interpreters and frameworks/libraries. I've learned enough different languages to be comfortable in picking up any new language quickly and easily, but the time consuming part for me is learning the frameworks/libraries which are specific to a given compiler/interpreter. The issue I have with Jython is not its use of Python2, but rather how easily extensible it is since you (likely) have to extend it in a different language if a capability isn't natively provided. But, this depends on the use case, what you're trying to achieve, and available technical expertise.

I see two use cases/capability levels here: 1) Using scripting within the bounds of a device/service to interact with the device/service's API, and 2) being able to do basically whatever you want on the device. In the case of an IIoT edge device like the Shelly plug, Python/Jython would be acceptable for use case (1). But, being able to bring whatever capabilities you want via regular python libraries (or better yet containers) would offer much more capability for (2). On an edge device where I'm not expecting to do something cute like run ML, (1) is acceptable and (2) is a bonus. However, in the case of ignition for instance, having (2) is a way bigger deal because I think of ignition as an 'I can do anything' platform, and Jython (not specifically Python2) really limits capability.

On embedded devices without an OS (e.g., microcontroller), I don't think you can really deliver (2) with a great developer experience. So, expectations should be set appropriately for the hardware/firmware and ecosystem at hand.","",""

With PoE as a requirement, the options are limited.  Groov RIO in a small panel is the only thing that comes to mind.  Beckhoff EtherCAT P Box is an IP67 option.  It will carry power over the bus, but would require an IoT bus coupler somewhere to convert to MQTT.  This might not be a problem if the bus will be scaled out for each coupler.

There are IP67 IFM IO-Link Masters that can be used with IO-Link devices or DI/DO.  Some models have an MQTT and REST interface.  With the hubs, they can scale out to a lot of I/O.  Only the master would need 24VDC and Ethernet, but all the sensors could be M12 runs.  They won't count products, but probably could can be configured to publish the rising edge with a timestamp.  You would need sophisticated client to make sense of and tally the messages.

It's worth mentioning that if the process is fast and really needs to reliable, it might be better off looking into a low cost PLC.  What might seem like higher cost to start with may scale quite well with low cost DI to proximity sensors and photoeyes.","","üíØ (1)"

it is a all in one box solution, where you can Connect any IO-Link Sensor of any vendor to one of the 4 Ports. The device Collects all the Sensor data by its self automatically, Stores the data in an on board influx DB. And generates automatically the basic Grafana Dashboards. 
In additon it comes with the Docker engine preinstalled, so you can spinn up any additional docker container of your choice. Node Red is the one most users use. 
The data is also published on an internal MQTT broker, so you can connect any other collection system to the internal data backbone.

This is browser code, running on your smart phone, to control the BLE radio built-in to your smart phone to talk to other BLE devices near your smart phone. Results of this communication can be returned to the browser for further use in the app. Given that many smart phone apps are written in browser-based, cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, I'd guess that most of them interact with off-board BLE devices in this way.

If you are looking for ways to network a number of wireless sensors within your plant, you want to look at [BLE Mesh](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/feature-enhancements/mesh/) technology.

""It's perhaps a misnomer to talk about HTTP over Bluetooth. That's not what's happening here. This is a three tier architecture, with very lightweight Bluetooth LE communication between (1) a Bluetooth device and a (2) dual technology Bluetooth and TCP/IP device, acting as a proxy, which then communicates the Bluetooth encoded request that it has configured within it, to a (3) remote HTTP server over TCP/IP.""

This seems similar to [6LoWPAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-6lowpan/) in that it *appears* to give each BLE or other constrained wireless device an IP address, while acknowledging that these constrained devices and networks are not suitable for full TCP/IP implementation. BLE has the ""HPS Server"" and 6LoWPAN has the ""edge router"" to bridge the gap. Not knowing your intended application, maybe this has utility, maybe not.","","üôè (1)"

So if I have 100 Identical Modbus devices, especially one like a power meter where there are a lot of signals. I can take a lot of time to map the first one.
But once you have that done, the second is really quick. So If I came to site with no work done before hand,  to connect to 10 devices, Day 1 might be all bout connect in. on Day 2 might be connecting to the fist unit, and creating the dashboards and graphics. Day 3 - I might get most of the other 9 all collecting data and displaying it and storing to the historian, and Day 4 might be doing soe tidying up and validating.


So if I have a modern device that can save time, it works really well on one Device, but as I increase devices that relative saving drops.

Also, I was proposing this where there is already a Platform( SCADA typically) that can already connect to a Modbus devices. I can publish to my UNS from the SCADA, essentially using it as a IIOT Gateway. If I have to go and get a platform the strategy might change.

I also like to have a power meter that I can look at the front and see what the value is, and use that for validation.","","üíØ (1)"

my point was this
using the opto and SPB lets say it takes 1 hours to configure and get it running, and the subsequent devices take 1 hours. and it takes me 30 minutes to do my validation. 

Using a cheaper Modbus device( lets say $300), it takes me 10 hours.
so there is a clear advantage in using the Opto I have saved 8.5 hours  do the cost difference of $700 is worth it. ( assuming a hour cost of >$80 an hour)

when I go to 10 devices,  the Otto still takes me an hour and  half for each one. so 15  hours.
the Modbus first one still takes me 10 hours, but the subsequent ones  take me an hour and a half too. 
now the additional $7000  I am only saving 8.5 hours.

Lets say I am putting in 100 energy meters now.
Saving the 8.5 hours for a cost of $70,000 might not be worth it, I can think of a lot of thing I could do with that
Of course that also need an integrators who is skilled enough to create reusable templates,

Those figures are out of my hat, and of course the Opto's can do other things, so it comes down to ""It Depends""","",""

"693309801589112862","_dyland","2025-07-01T21:24:22.1240000+08:00","Honestly, For me, having ordered one early and gotten another maybe a year ago, it's a combination of price and UX. On price, I rarely want just one or two sensors and when we talk multiple SHARCs we get into competition with the Opto 22 Grov RIO... Which wins out with features and UX. 

Adding to the cost is the need for POE, one of the biggest constraints for so many things in manufacturing is the lack of controls networks (at all) let alone POE Switches on the plant floor. So while I would love to fix this on a macro level a product that doesn't offer an immediate solution has already segmented its market to those that have.

After the price, my experience setting these up hasn't been the promised two minute install. Maybe that's user error and maybe it's room for improvement in the setup and configuration workflow flow? 

After that, it's marketing, brand, trust, etc. while I know otherwise and deeply respect the engineering that went into it, it does ""Feel"" cheap compared to other industrial components.

A technical side of trust, with any component like this, is how to do mass firmware updates? Visibility and maintainability of a fleet of SHARCs?

Above all, from the outside, I see it as a marketing and fit problem more than anything. Why use the SHARC over an IO link adapter or a platform like IFM Moneo? 

Again, all of this is my opinion based on my observations from the sidelines. I could very well be wrong.","","üëç (2)"

I recommend looking onto Dylan's point.

I just recently stopped working for a sensor manufacturer; now at an AI startup.  If I was still there, I'd be pushing to add MCP server capability to networked devices.
The effort to add a couple of basic MCP tools is quite low.  If they're read-only, you could skip some of security aspects for now.

However, I really can't say if or when that would turn into a measurable increase in sales.  You'd need to find people with pain points for which this is _the_ solution.  At the moment, MCP for sensors seems more ""nice to have"" - but I believe that will change.  Maybe you can ride the AI wave instead it washing you away.  Other sensor OEMs will be slower on this.","",""

This is about complex devices with lots of settings, which are non-trivial for humans to work with.  Each device is different too.  MCP would allow for AI support for configuration or (in my startup's case) autonomous remediation.

It's not as much of a joke as one might think, either.  There isn't really a standard for REST yet either, but I've seen devices placing a retained message in the UNS containing the base REST URL.  Could we not do that for MCP?

you say ""a probe that could be on a fitting and inserted into a pipe of the fluid as it transfers through""  my brain is saying, yes a Thermowell, a very common way of measuring temperature of liquids in pipes. you do want to make sure that the thermocouple is making good contact with the end of the thermowell so make sure you size them together,

1. A molten tank of wax. It's churning a pretty decent amount, but an analog temperature probe is showing about 5-10 degrees different than a Banner S15S series IR sensor. I actually attribute this to the fact that the probe is reading _within_ the tank and the sensor is reading the top layer of wax. (NOTE: A bigger risk here is the sensor getting covered in wax, imho)

2. A water tank. Same line as the wax tank, just filled with cool water. Again, not sure how much issue there may be with splashing for how close these sensors should be to their target (~300mm).

3. A chill roller that is chrome-plated (see: very shiny). There are cutouts in the shaft of the cylinder for analog temp probes so having a probe that can fit in and measure would be ideal. We have to do some more testing with a bearing temperature probe to compare surface temp to the IR reading.

In each of these cases, having a probe to ""dip"" into the thing I am measuing would be helpful. I have a Banner DXMR90-1XE which does modbus from M12 connections, and they also have a converter (S15C-I) which can convert 4-20mA signals to some scaled reading. 

I'm trying to figure out if there's something pretty simple I can hook to this device to read better.
