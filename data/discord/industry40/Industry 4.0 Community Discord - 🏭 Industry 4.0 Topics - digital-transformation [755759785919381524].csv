Spent some time in airpor baggage handling as well and about 5 years in Lithium Ion battery manufacturing as well. I think the biggest hurdle to automotive is fear. There’s such a strong mentality of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. A lot of legacy systems and software as well that are so heavily intertwined to operations, it would be a massive cost to replace/remove.","","💯 (3),👍 (2)"

Yes. I've been in the Semiconductor industry since 79: AMD, Signetics, National Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products, Linear Technologies, etc.... My career has been spent performing troubleshooting, repair, death by preventive maintenance procedure, modification, upgrading, keeping the calm, writing / improving procedures and specs, leading teams, and many meetings. I train, mentor, assign tasks, push agendas, and console team mates grieving from life's many hardships. I get my pick of any tough, exotic problems that come up, and I love it.

What do you think was their biggest hurdles to digital transformation? 
First off, a full transformation hasn’t been achieved where I work. Additionally, no one has thrown down from the top of the pyramid I live in, that it is a hardcore mandate, and corporate priority. 
Secondly, if it was a top priority, you already spelled out the primary obstacle: Ignorance. Managers have no idea how. 
And why is that? Hardly anyone knows what digital transformation means. Many have never even heard of Industry 4.0. The term is still young in the collective consciousness. Plus, even if they have heard of it, it's similar to what happens if you ask 500 people what heaven is like, you get 500 answers, and likely none of them are 100% right. The full definition can mean a lot of different things to different people. 
Because the answer can be somewhat nebulous, so is the roadmap to it. 
It's a question that leads people to fantasize, or their pupils to dilate to the size of a pinhead, and stare out the window like a confused chicken. Transformation can be a very long journey. It is a living, moving target, like a piece of software: perhaps never completed.","","👍 (3)"

@Walker Reynolds Yes. Out of school, I worked at a PCB assembly shop. Programming and Operating pick and place machines. When I took over my line, there were conveyors between each work cell (screen printer, pick and place, reflow oven) but none were operational. By the time I left there, I had them all connected and working together. Once I had a job up and running I spent the rest of my time researching my next job. As an engineer, I worked at a medical manufacturer for 3 years before moving to my current job. I'm no longer production support but I build and design machines for the floor.

At all previous employers, the biggest hurdle to digital transformation was lack of ambition. The PCB assembler and medical manufacturer did not forward think at all. Capital expenditure was rare. My current company is 100% on board. The only questions we have left are how. We are having a digital roadmap meeting this Friday! 😄","","🆒 (2)"

In my opinion the biggest problem is a wrong understanding of what the technologies on the market do and how they help. I've seen many people saying they need a SCADA or Historian as if it was a magical thing that would automatically solve the problem by working in an autonomous way. I've seen people trying add control logic on SCADA to save on PLC. I've seen people expecting Historian performance on SCADA without being commited to the same price tag. I've seen people require a SCADA and Oracle and then expect the SCADA to be a DBA managing the Oracle with the excuse that PLCs don't need maintenance so the database of OT should also not need.  The possibilities are immense and I could stay here for hours writing, but in short is to not know what to buy, how to specify a RFQ and lack of internal and qualified team to manage projects, use all the system can deliver and maintain it.","","👍 (1)"

Biggest issue to transformation: initially, lack of vision/understanding from upper management and thus lack of budget.  Later a changing of the guard for some upper management, but then they were tied to former vendors who didn't really understand or have experience with the transformation, or understand well what real-time data could buy them besides a possible ""I used to have this phone app at my old plant"" - but they didn't see value in things like alerts for changes outside of expected parameters, such as when Joe turns a knob at 3am just because he thinks it helps or his notes suggest that's the right # to run at, despite the fact it's been running great all day.  So lack of Vision and Lack of Understanding, leading to a lack of budget and resources.

As an employee and consultant for other companies in the Industrial space around the world I've been fortunate to work with vendors/companies that were working on improving their business by bringing in more real-time data and/or analytics.

But as it's written elsewhere, it's the same here imo - the largest issue is lack of vision/understanding.  This has been an age old issue.  Here's a quote from long ago ""My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge"" (Approx. 720 - 780 BC)","","👍 (3),🙌 (1)"

It's viewed more like a necessary evil: ""We'll only get as much as we absolutely need and no more, and don't expect me to understand what it does or evaluate the trade-offs myself. That's what I have you for. But in the end, I'm not really going to listen to any of that analysis because you aren't high enough in the organization to discuss business strategy."" <Pardon the rant> My takeaway is that engineers who want to have sway in these decisions need to understand the business.

@Walker Reynolds I don't have experience working in manufacturing, however, I did work as a control systems engineer at a large fulfillment center.

@Mario Ishikawa that's an interesting perspective. I was thinking the opposite was true, especially for middle managers responsible for stretching the budget as far as it will go.

@Josh Eastburn yes, it all depends of the kind of customer/plant. If it is a plant with 4 lines and there is no more room for a 5th line, the investment to move or build another building, not to mention the machinery cost, can be prohibitive and it is better to work on cost reduction. On the other hand, what some colleagues mention is that when you sell something that makes your customer to make more money you are their happy agenda. It does not need to be necessarily a new machine but maybe an upgrade on it that will make it produce faster. But to simplify we can think of it as CAPEX. Something they buy to just get started. When you sell something to reduce costs, you are usually on the problem agenda of them, and as it is something already running, it is OPEX, usually with several budget limitations. As a friend of mine selling technology for grocery stores to save on energy, he says: it is hard to convince the customer to invest to save when he can use the same budget to buy more refrigerators and then increase food sales. It is possible, of course. But harder to get on their agenda for active sales, meaning, you want to show by your numbers what they can do but that is not what they are worried about. But if the manager already have this in mind than it is easier as you said. They will look for the vendor.","",""

@Walker Reynolds Price point is my biggest sticking point with Industry in general. I can buy a $20 micro that has multiple digital and analog inputs, a wifi card and antenna, and easy to use, built-in libraries for writing programs, including MQTT. To get something like that in PLC form is $500+ for a ""low-cost"" option.

Choosing which one to use in a specific application is all dependent on the problem, the value of the process it is running and the minimum requirements for reliability.  You have some end-users that don't use low end hardware because it is 'cheap' or its 'hobbyist' and you have some end-users who want to turn away from high end hardware because its too expensive or its overkill.

If your org is certified to any industry standards (e.g., quality, environmental, security, financial), there's a good chance you might have something.  These invariable have some component of managing awareness and competence across the work force.

What does your company use for an HCM?  Many HCM suites have training modules.  You can roll this into or synthesize with existing training programs.  This software usually have canned-reports you can leverage.  Additionally, many of these have SQL backends, so you can do quite a bit of customization for reporting.

We use our a training module in our ERP today.  The skills are centered around operations, quality, and product development.  They basically state ""Employee X must have Skill Y to perform Process Z.""  It works well for the day-to-day and auditors love this.  It helps determine training requirements.  It doesn't necessarily facilitate planning, though.  We're looking to formalize aspects of this into formal workforce planning on an HCM.  A lot of training matrices enable one to take stock of the supply and demand of skills, but not necessarily how to change it.  I think a lot of that is driven by the potential of employees.  Too often, we all think about our workforce in terms of what they're capable of doing today, but not tomorrow.","",""

I finally had a chance to watch this video. I can easily see how Quality Assurance has put a stranglehold on drug manufacturing. In a discussion with my ER/UC Nurse wife, who piloted COVID-SARS-2 testing in our county, drug companies came by the oversight honestly due to past instances of unsanitary conditions, and cases of corner cutting due to sheer greed. https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/cders-efforts-help-improve-quality-drug-compounding-include-ongoing-focus-insanitary-conditions
That said I can see that QA may have gone overboard in their quest of the Holy QA grail. And it sounds like an area of that got overwhelmed with over- the-top regulation is electrical signal validation. I'm certainly not an expert in this area, but I can see how this could happen. I applaud Walker and Team for trying to cut through the bullshit and wind it back down to something reasonable.

We have digitally transformed most of the plant and supporting operations over the past 2.5 years, the maintenance department is looking to tap into our Unified Namespace  data to drive PM activities over time, incorporate the  maintenance schedule  into the production schedule, receive work requests directly from the MES, and move all the standard maintenance functionality to a modern system.

If it isn't written in a comment, it didn't happen. Historical searches are the real meat and potatoes .  CMMS have drastically matured and changed over the years. Just about every manufacturer out there has dabbled in their own home brewed version.  The ability to perform pareto analysis on equipment failures is the only way an organization can  be easily engaged in continuous improvement. Without that ability, the Maintenance department is crippled. Fiix was well engineered. Our facilities department uses it, but EM didn't adopt it due to subscription cost bleed. I would love it if Intellic wrote their own CMMS, and made it 4.0 friendly. I think that would be an awesome product. @DavidSchultz great comments. TY","","👍 (5)"

The integration with the non-maintenance modules (e.g., purchasing, inventory, asset list) is nice, but it has the ""afterthoughtness"" of many ERP modules.  Functionality and user experience are definitely not best-in-class.  There has been under-investment in this product area and most buyers in the ERP-realm lack domain expertise in maintenance or even an appreciation for it..

Infor EMM and UpKeep are new to me.  Is Infor EMM an evolution of MP2?  Anyone using IBM's Maximo these days?  They seem to brand as something new (e.g., ""Watson"", ""AI""), but I have not cut through the marketing.

There are some less-traditional options I've pondered:  ServiceMax and ServiceNow.  Service Max is a field service SaaS app built on the Salesforce platform and was recently acquired by GE Digital.  ServiceNow is a IT service management platform that has become somewhat of the premier workflow cloud and jack-of-all-trades for service management.

Any Integrators in the New England area on here that subscribe in to the IIoT structure as @Walker Reynolds/4.0 Solutions suggests?

I'd like to work with you.

I'm an engineer at small/medium manufacturer in New Hampshire that makes pulleys for the OPE market (and developing new products). We are starting our journey in Digital Transformation which is why I joined Mastermind and Mentorship program. However, I am not ready yet to lead a Digital Transformation project and we are wanting to get started sooner than later.

We are actively looking for Integrators to partner with but I'm having trouble identifying those that are technology driven and not solution driven.

We have a firm coming in from Boston on Friday to present their vision. My background research on them looks like they push PTC ThingWorx. I don't know much about ThingWorx but it doesn't look open to me. If we can't find alternatives firms though, we will end up with them or someone similar. We're too small and lean to manage a massive project like this without outside help.

We'd like to have someone local-ish but are open to others.

As Zack says. OPC UA can absolutely be used to connect to PLCs, but only because a specific PLC doesn't come with an IoT protocol built in (edge driven, report by exception, light weight, open).","","🔥 (1),💯 (2)"

I don't believe that Microsoft thinks MQTT is proprietary.  They actually leverage MQTT (as well as AMQP) as transport in their own platform.  If I recall correctly, many Azure products even ""strip out"" OPC-UA along the way and exchange data in simple JSON form.  In general, I believe Microsoft and the OPC Foundation's have the right intentions, but they're not truly addressing the problem.  It feels good to everyone selling, but it's not helping those deploying and using (e.g., manufacturers, machine builders, system integrators).

Personally, I have not had issues with the relative ""openness"" of OPC-UA or how heavy it is.  I've generally had the luxury of performant networks and don't perceive the barriers to entry as significant or prohibitive.  But, I recognize this is definitely not a universal experience.  My biggest critique is the adoption of the standard.  It tries to be everything to everyone and makes it all optional.  It's like a non-binding UN agreement without any real ""teeth"" (e.g., substance, accountability).  It's more symbolic than substantive.  We still can't buy assets, applications, or platforms that are intelligently aware of each other.  Specifying OPC-UA does not change this.  The vast majority of OPC-UA implementations are still exchanging information in the same way it has been done for 30 years with OPC Classic.  This is not helping manufacturers digitally transform.","","💯 (2),📢 (1),👍 (1)"

OPC-UA has been interesting to explore the non DA functions. For example, in the AutoID spec, there is a tag that represents the LastScanData. A client can also subscribe to the event of the scan coming in, which includes the scan data and other metadata. The tag will give you the data at the negotiated scan rate, whereas the event subscription fires immediately (0 lag in data). I don't know if any Sparkplug client-devices allow this function: segregating some data for publishing immediately and others at a rate. Obviously something like ignition it HighByte could do this, but don't know if devices are set up this way. So OPC has great features.","","👍 (1)"

It gets complicated in OPC-UA. You need an OPC-UA client/server aggregator, then you need a way for that aggregator to discover the new server, and initiate it's connection, then the aggregator needs to insert the equipment in it's address space so it makes sense (data modeling) then the devices in the ecosystem need to detect the change in the address space of the aggregator and then the devices need to create their subscriptions to the new equipment.

I don't even think this functionality even exists in the market (I've looked) and likely is at least five years out.","",""

You could move sensors around the line, to different cells (rectifiers and ph sensors were the big ones) and the SCADA application would self discover that the sensor was moved in the namespace and it would automatically move to the correct cell in the visualization.  It worked great for deploying new lines with different configurations of sensors... the only limitation was that you needed to integrate a new faceplate or visual object each time you created a new type of sensor... but after that, fully self-aware.  The device drove the visuals, no server side work at all.","","👍 (1)"

Here's the short, unqualified answer:  .NET, Java, Python, SQL

In general, .NET and Java are the most prevalent languages in enterprise software.  In recent years, the adoption of Python has grown considerably.  These combined with SQL for databases cover many needs.  These tools should be capable of solving most integration problems.

It's worth mentioning that the manufacturing and industrial space is no stranger to legacy technologies.  You will invariably encounter legacy applications that exist because an organization's culture rewards stability and, hence, complacency.  Don't be surprised to see VB or IBM mainframe tech.  You may need to coexist with or migrate from these systems.  While I would not advise directly learning this tech, I believe it's important to be capable of working with people who have.

Ignition and Factory Studio are popular platforms among this community and its founders.  These solutions are built on Java and .NET, respectively.  Both have support for scripting with Python.

Useful technical skills for system integration involving MES:

  -A foundation in object-oriented programming (e.g., .NET, Java)
  -Scripting with a higher-level general purpose language (e.g., Python)
  -Programming relational databases (e.g., T-SQL, PL/pgSQL, PL/SQL, MySQL)
  -Working with APIs (e.g., HTTP/S, REST, SOAP)
  -Working with IoT and field protocols (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET)","","ismile (4),💯 (3)"

**Digital Factory**
<Company> has started a pilot program and initiative for digitally transforming the entire way we manufacture our <Widgets>. Over the next few years, every piece of equipment, machinery and process will be plugged into our network, enabling real-time information access and predictive analytics to your products as we produce them.

This process will bring manufacturing information, in real-time:
- To our operators and maintenance staff on plant floor - enabling them to make better, decisions, faster so your parts arrive on-time, and at the highest quality
- To our engineers and planners - so they can design the best possible processes, reducing lead times and predicting issues before they happen
- To our quality department - providing deeper insights for root cause analysis and lot tracing as events occur
- To the environment - by minimizing waste and running our equipment more efficiently
- To our customers - allowing you to plan and better predict your own manufacturing by providing up-to-the-minute status reports and accurate delivery predictions in addition to higher quality

This is an exciting process for us and we look forward to sharing more as we progress.","","💯 (2),plcnext (1),🔥 (1)"

BI tools tend to only address reporting needs for large periods of time with processed data rollups.  One tool I like for reporting outside the historian is Flow Software.  They do a great job at combining multiple historians, sql dbs, and scada solutions to a single data bucket that can show resolution down to one minute processed data.

Digitization (the act of taking something manual or paper and making it digital) is a sub-set of Digital Transformation (a strategy for changing the way manufacturers operate their businesses by leveraging real-time digital data and information to drive decision making).  Digitization is the easy stuff -- there's nothing special about taking a paper traveler and turning it into a digital visualization (it takes hours to do).  Digital Transformation is hard, very hard, because it requires a level of vision and strategy that most organizations are simply not accustomed to exercising.  Digital Transformation is about exponentially increasing the collective knowledge of an organization -- Digitization is simply taking a physical or manual thing and making it digital (something you can make many virtual copies of).  RE: Digital Transformation, if what we want (use case) is a function of what we know, and DT is about exponentially increasing the collective knowledge of an organization, then what we know will change exponentially across the organization as a function of DT.  You must implement a strategy FIRST that accounts for this scaling knowledge -- because what you want will scale at the same rate.  This is why organizations fail in DT -- they start with the wrong strategy, technology or partners... and then they can't scale their digital solutions with their collective knowledge.  

I spend most of my time re-wiring the ways companies think -- so they can implement the right strategy, use the right technology and avoid the wrong partners.  This community is all about creating an army of professionals who take the same approach.

In addition to other things, I've got a few ""general comments"" that I thought might help though. If anyone has other thoughts/suggestions, all input is appreciated:  

* Data and Pretty Dashboards don’t provide value. Actions from information that can be unlocked from data we collect is where we see value. Insights provide no value, actions from insights do.

* Our operators, technicians, etc… often know what problems they have and have ideas about what they need to solve those problems. 

* Information NOW, not tomorrow!

* No matter how pretty, I’ve never seen a dashboard run a machine. I have, however, seen dashboards and systems help PEOPLE to run machines more efficiently, decrease costs, improve quality, increase customer satisfaction, help with safety, etc…

* Digital Transformation is about making data collection, and using that data, easier. It is about giving users what they need and letting them act on that instead of spending as much time with collection/processing. Digital Transformation isn’t about eliminating jobs through automation. If anything, it can create jobs by providing more information and improving the business allowing us to create more positions.","",""

I love this top-level overview from a CESMII presentation for several reasons. 
1. It's circular, not linear. The nested loops within the bigger one allow you to talk about the levels of DT benefits--- local data to machine, real-time integrated plant status, enterprise level analysis, ML... 

2. It's completely divorced from software, devices, platforms and whether something is done on the edge, on-prem or in the cloud, which are all distractions to the big picture. 

3. It makes it obvious that DT is a strategy for *leveraging data* that requires a data architecture that can enable it.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/834885217713782784/SmartManufacturingOverview_CESMII.PNG?ex=68df8633&is=68de34b3&hm=5b926bd1e3b67ae7a0f65bfd49b96f97ea4467346a1a39ec0be95441e368a31b&","🙏 (2),highbyte (2),hivemq (2),👍 (2),flow (1)"

1. Data are the ingredients and information is the meal.  We turn ingredients into meals for sustenance.  Raw data (ingredients) is valuable only to the extent that it can be transformed into information (meal)  that can be analyzed and acted upon.  Most folks agree with this statement -- the piece that most are missing is that what we want to cook (design or develop a capability) is a function of what ingredients we have available to us.  The value we place on a specific ingredient is a function of value we have realized from turning that ingredient into a meal.  Dashboards don't provide value per se, but they do provide an entry-point into the real value... which is turning data into information that we can act on -- over and over again, iteratively.

2. The smartest people in the org are on the plant floor -- they can save us millions if we listen to and enable them.  Digital Transformation is, in part, all about enabling them to unlock potential on the plant floor.

3. Make decisions today based on data we collect today and compare to data we collected yesterday (or last week or last month etc)

4. Dashboards are simply a pane of glass through which we enter in order to turn data into information that we can act on.

5. Digital Transformation is about taking the data all around you, that you likely don't even know is there, and begin to collect it in real-time, in a unified way, in order to turn that data into information to drive decisions in real-time.  I often like to ask plant managers to forget everything they know about technology, about what's possible, about what is practical and ask them to work with me to whiteboard the perfect operation -- what would it look like if EVERYTHING were possible AND we have unlimited time and money?  I then take their dreams and draw a straight line from today to the realization of their perfect operation.  That is DT.

Nice work.","",""

I christen today’s excellent Q&A with the title *Discussion on Digital Transformation as creating an ecosystem of value exchange, and the best approach to effect that change in manufacturing*.

@Mario Ishikawa Mario made a great comment that the difference between Walker and Luke was largely a difference in sales approach. Walker’s is an inside-out approach (starting with manufacturing operations) vs. Luke’s outside-in approach (knocking down the firewalls separating company and supply chain, company and consumers). 

Is it more effective to talk to executives about trends in increased value from data-driven plant operations, or from bringing suppliers and customers into the ecosystem? Is the 4.0 Product Manager a data analyst or an MVP (minimum viable product) designer defining value needs of end users? Listening, it seems the answer is some of both.

Luke’s statement--- “To revolutionize manufacturing, yes, we have to get the tech right, but also, we must alter a company’s business model.” 

I want to say …AND we have to openly acknowledge culture and company values, how these determine the way technology is applied, to empower people or against them. Consumer and employee trust in the business intent is important. Hence Luke’s story about (perversely) using sensor data to revoke machine warranty coverage. Walker once mentioned executives who view plant floor personnel as expendable. 

I do believe we 4.0 proponents need to be experts in helping companies identify and create value, how to align with values and incentivize the right things, how to avoid bad design and poor implementation. I’m not so convinced we can help those with entrenched shortsightedness and values coming from the Ferengi school of business.","","💯 (6),💙 (1),👽 (1)"

You don’t get that from business analytics alone. You get it from listening to people where they work or having done their job yourself. (You get info about customer behavior from analytics but not their motivations, pain points for value creation.)

The prevailing MVP approach is a two-edged sword---a way to continuously create value, or pressure to start developing “solutions” without validating what problems are to be solved.  Few companies actually do the work of customer development---creating, demonstrating, verifying real-world value in an operational setting, and testing value propositions in the specific targeted communities. The point is to develop what people need but may not have even envisioned yet, not what your business wants to sell.

There’s a conversation I think is related to this starting here https://discord.com/channels/738470295056416930/738470295056416934/830411769628852226 with @Daniel_H. Daniel’s lament about non-substantive product offerings…

I know from my university, for example, that Siemens supports many industrial research projects at the chairs. Perhaps this disconnect is deliberate or the teaching has a bias because of the funders. That's how you come into contact with these closed systems at an early stage. 

My critical attitude only results from the fact that my father is familiar with this area and knows the dominance of Siemens (as a example), for example on the PLC side, and what problems it brings for the automation landscape in companies.

Speaking of the automation landscape. As a young engineer, you enter the companies and experience this dominance.

Having a startup, I see tons of people who are interested in this kind of company, usually attracted not only by innovation but a different culture, and a feeling of more control on their tasks and lives. Even with automation, operators have their time dictated by machines. Machines are expensive and if they are available and need operators, operators have to adjust to their time and not the opposite. I once was talking to a plant owner that mentioned he got a coffee machine to make his operator lives better. But then he noticed some people were bringing their own mugs from home. I really did not understand what was the problem with bringing their own mug and he mentioned that the machine could provide a small plastic cup, but with their own mug they would fill with more coffee and stay more time away from the machine. So, this is the type of mentality that in my opinion need to change and it is not only cultural. Technology should be applied to improve that.","","👍 (1)"

An organization’s Industry 3.0 mindset, as a function of recruiting and developing the manufacturing employee of the future is a leading indicator that an organization will have greater difficulty in recruiting and developing the technologists needed to build the work force of the future.  This is a measurable fact — one that shows up in every demographic and industry survey and report I have read or worked on in the last decade.  Technologists, especially those from Gen Z, are looking for 2 things in an organization — a common mission that transcends business and society AND a commitment to leveraging and working with bleeding edge technology.

GE was once the gold-standard in industry and now they are quickly approaching punchline status.  When one considers the power of the brand, the advocacy from Buffett et al within capital markets, and the tribal and formalized industrial knowledge and expertise extending out of the legacy businesses — it it quite difficult to comprehend how GE could have been so wrong.  Luke — you correctly highlight many of the things that GE has done right after 2000 that should have positioned them to take over a market vulnerable to attack (Rockwell is the least respected, appreciated, valued player in the industrial solutions market — one with 75% market share in the U.S.).  At the end of the day, GE simply did not leverage all of their advantages because their strategy was flat-out wrong.  As MP likes to point out, do you want to be stuck in AOLs platform for internet access or would you rather use a web-browser?  GE, as a player in the I 4.0 market, is running out of time... and I see no indication they have even changed tacks, let alone are pointed in the right direction.  For all of the advantages they started with... and the ‘right’ decisions they have actually made... they simply do not have the results to show for it.  Immelt is to blame for that — his hubris passed on down through the organization and it is demonstrated in the products, services and distribution strategies they employ.  I hope GE turns it around, I do... but until such a time, they are an example of what not to do in this space.

I've worked on a couple of projects where we used discovery tools (eg Cisco CyberVision) to identify what was connected to the OT network and then push that data into a network admission tool (eg Cisco Identity Services Engine) to define/apply the right policy. That is then pushed back down into the network to provide appropriate segmentation etc. Using OT specific discovery tools allows a far greater level of granularity in that segmentation - for example by manufacturer or device type. This works with network switching and firewalls. We developed pxGrid specifically to enable this and a number of other vendors have enabled the capability. This blogpost is a couple of years old but outlines the intent and lists some of the OT vendors: https://blogs.cisco.com/security/how-alliances-strengthen-your-cybersecurity-defenses. Here is another blog, written before we had CyberVision, based on Industrial Network Director: https://blogs.cisco.com/digital/ot-intent-based-security-policies.

In addition, we are seeing more SDA capabilities being integrated into OT networking kit. 

I will acknowledge that none of this has been without teething troubles but the technology will improve rapidly.

The challenge for anyone wanting to automate plantfloor networks is that it requires a certain level of 'intelligence' in that network. Flat, layer 2 networks, composed of unmanaged switches will need a serious upgrade.","","👍 (1),🧡 (1)"

At the Canary Roadshow last week, @Jeff@Flow asked for input on functions needed to take the app to the enterprise level and this was my first thought. After watching how to truncate sets of tag names (hiding the hierarchy) and create alias view names in Canary, followed by the Tatsoft demo seamlessly importing object tags, calculated tags, fr disparate sources to build visualizations that may not indicate the data model, quality and rules change history in the UI, and thinking--- with all this exciting flexibility comes the unmanageable complexity. 

Does it not matter to be able to trace or standardize at which level, in what app, what parameters, what rules? Add in Ignition, Flow, OSI PI, BI, analysis tools... to the mix. I don't see that any one historian or control automation software could/should manage the whole fit-for-purpose industrial data structure.  Highbyte may be in a the best position to address it.

At the time, it was the wild west. There were no standards taking hold yet and it was up for grabs. 

It makes sense that GE followed AOL's playbook: be the go-to place for business insight, build it from scratch and leverage its huge amount of industry knowledge.

I remember helping a customer in Boston that was a home contractor. There was an issue with GE circuit breaker nusiance tripping GE Appliances. I, helping the design of the circuit breakers, traveled there with designers of the appliances to troubleshoot on-site.  What other company could provide such end-to-end system service for a customer? Their breadth was unmatched.

I believe that Immelt et al. may have even believed that GE had an obligation to drive this, given how large its influence was and no one else would be able to do it; , and of course profit along the way.

Building a platform when there is nothing is hard enough. Sorting through what technology is going to be accepted by the market is also tough.

The one mistake I will fault them for was any effort to be the AOL of industry.  Building an architecture defined by common, available interfaces is the right architecture. Before those interfaces exist, however, there will always be the forerunners like AOL that build something from nothing.  How proprietary they are is the likelihood they won't last.","",""

There must be an asset strategy and a plan which guides the decision making around assets and technology. From there it can be incorporated into other aspects of reliability, namely technical activities (engineering, condition management and work execution). It is then incumbent on leadership to ensure compliance with the strategy and plan. This is why the DX strategy is so critical (and nothing should happen until its done).

Taking a page out of the ISO 55000 playbook, the strategy and plan will guide the technical activities. It will help determine how say a UNS will be built and how the various solutions will interact with it. As you note, there are many solutions that will consume and publish data to the UNS, just like there are to manage asset condition. The decision will be a function of the problem to be solved.

Lastly, GE failed to recognize that DT is a strategy driven by technology, not a project driven by a solution.  They couldn't have possibly been more wrong with their approach.

The financial crisis in 2008 and its prolonged recovery heightened awareness of myriad long-term trends of de-industrialization and competitiveness in high-wage economies.  There became a bigger appreciation of the economic stability and associated employment that a thriving industrial base provides.

Hannover Messe was, without question, the awareness catalyst in the industrial / tech community.  That show has really grown in popularity.  2016 was a huge year with US as the partner country.  The image of Angela Merkel and Barack Obama in attendance meeting with the automation companies was a pretty big deal.  It became fashionable for all the major heads of state to back high-profile industrial initiatives (e.g., Smart Manufacturing, China Manufacturing 2025, Usine du Futur, Produktion 2030, Innovate UK, Manufacturing Innovation 3.0, Made in India).  Before this, the term ""I4.0"" arguably could have been written off as a marketing term.  Outside the industrial world, the Klaus Schwab (World Economic Forum) book on the fourth industrial revolution in 2015 really brought the term into the mainstream and investor communities.  For the following year or two, it seemed like every keynote presentation at every conference included a history lesson on the industrial revolution.  At the very least, the world at-large became vaguely familiar with the concept.","",""

This signified formal policy making and investment in industrial tech under the banner of I4.0.  This is when the high-profile programs in North Rhine-Westphalia really took off.  Some of the most influential applied engineering research of the decade came out of the *Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries* and *Intelligent Technical Systems OstWestfalenLippe (its OWL)* clusters.

Informally, Industry 4.0 is the norm for younger firms (<20 years) – whether they realize it or not.  Organizations that were conceived during the internet age simply do not have the baggage that their elder peers do.  They’re not inhibited by long investment cycles, legacy technology and “old school” culture.  These firms, all these equal, have a considerable advantage.  They are not distracted and spooked by sunk costs.   Their plants never had paper and everything was digitized by default.  Transforming into a smart plant is just a natural extension of this.  For them, Industry 4.0 is just the natural thing to do.  They don’t know anything else.  One could make an argument that these firms were doing Industry 4.0 long before anyone uttered the term in Hannover or Davos.","","💡 (2),👍 (6)"

I have been working for a few companies in a global organization and the same trend is clear... the traditional IT OT organizations and procedures are not being changed and it’s a constant battle between those departments, both from global and local perspectives.... Typical hot topics: who manages Kepserver, IT in one factory, OT in another... Want a change when IT manages?? -> response is open a ticket... this for me is absolutely crazy... Then there are discussions on who should drive DT in manufacturing, IT or OT???? I still feel a dedicated department should be established which is driving the DT home and really bridging the gap between IT and OT and of course the business... would be great to get some feedback on experience of what has worked and what has failed from this group and hopefully @Walker Reynolds  has some input from his side... thanks!!!!!","","🙌 (5)"

They are much closer to the OT side than regular IT but a big problem for them is that the team is currently too small to handle everything from PLC connectivity through production systems to cloud connectivity, data analytics and machine learning. At the same time they need to know IT processes like the procurement process for external software development partners which makes it even more difficult. And we still have the discussion about who manages the KEPServer 🙂 Still there certainly are advantages. For example they are specifying requirements for new machines looking at it from a DT perspective (like the vendor must provide certain documentation on the data the machines produce and what the documentation should include or that the machines must support certain protocols).

I am recently looking into the metrics measurement and as what Walker has mentioned in some of his past videos, OEE is frequently used to compute for the performance. I get the most parts except when it comes to the computation of Performance where we divide 'ideal run rate' by the actual run rate. The question is, whether the ideal run rate can be something subjective, in which case the OEE outcome would rely on the assumption about the ideal run rate and therefore turning the OEE to be something only meaningful for the company itself, and it is incomparable within the industry as the standard can hardly be unified. (A quick example I am thinking of is a coca-cola line to a pepsi line and will there be some 'ideal run rate' as the guardrail for both of them?) The reason I am asking is because I did see some papers talking about the industrial standards for some products. Hope someone can help. If it turns out that ideal run rate can be something deterministic in real life, would love to know the way in computing it. Thanks!","",""

I think some standards for a certain products have an ideal run rate based on a limitation of physics… like pills can literally only be so fast and bottles can only fill so fast. So in theory there is a theoretical Max run wait that goes beyond the OEM… assuming the production machine has everything serialized… but what if the Pepsi bottling line has three fillers in line whereas the Coke bottling line only has two?

For existing systems you generally put in a gateway (hardware or software). In most cases the existing PLCs don’t support MQTT so you can use gateway from native protocol or OPC UA to MQTT. This is also why your architecture probably need an IoT hub of sorts (the main software you use to build a UNS), like Factory Studio, Ignition, canary labs, Highbyte. They can connect to many different data sources, model/structure the data and connect it all to a UNS. For SCADA/MES layer it may be necessary to replace, but this depends.

Before PTC acquired ThingWorx, most would use Kepware (or similar) to acquire data from Rockwell PLCs (or similar).  They would use OPC-UA or HTTP.  

After PTC acquired ThingWorx in 2013, users still largely relied on third-party industrial driver suites like Kepware.  

After PTC acquired Kepware in 2016, a native ThingWorx ""AlwaysOn"" protocol interface was added.  ThingWorx had better luck using this WebSocket technology than HTTP and OPC-UA.  It was more performant and stateful over constrained connections (e.g., WAN, internet).  By and large, PTC was still relying on Kepware to expose OPC tags to the ThingWorx platform

After Rockwell invested in PTC in 2018, as I understand it, Rockwell productized its PLC and FactoryTalk software portfolio with PTC's ThingWorx under the ""Innovation Suite"" bundle.  There are some connectors that expose select FactoryTalk MES objects to ThingWorx.  They do exchange asset structure in ISA95 style fashion.  But, beyond this, Rockwell and PTC still rely on Kepware to more-or-less connect everything.

While there's nothing wrong with Kepware, I do believe the way Rockwell and PTC have opted to integrate their products is quite telling.  After investing a few billion dollars, they're still using the same third-party technology that system integrators would have nearly a decade ago.  It speaks well to the power of Kepware.  It speaks poorly to the integration capabilities and general openness of Rockwell and PTC.  This level of investment and lack of anything to show for it makes it clear that said deal was not about improving product, but marketing and selling.  Apparently, that's good enough for customers and investors.  It's remarkable that one can claim market share by reselling a partners' solution and deploying Kepware.","","👍 (2),😆 (2)"

I'm not coming from the automation world but rather from top floor software development.

In general - you'll find that the world of PLCs/HMI and automation are years behind this type of technology and even thinking, compared to the ""normal"" software development world. My thoughts is that this is partly due to the fact that PLC/HMI software (mostly) operates on vendor specific purpose built hardware and operating systems, not like in IT where it's mostly general purpose hardware and operating systems. PLCs have AT LEAST 15+ years of expected lifetime. This means that in most cases you are dealing with legacy systems. PLC programming languages are also mostly visual and sometimes vendor specific, and even though there exists one standard that most vendors use, it still doesn't mean the source code is kept in an open format that can be used by any other PLC (sometimes even encrypted source code). The PLCs I've come across does have a way to export programs to an open format, but it's still vendor specific, and not very human readable due to the visual nature of the languages. PLCs also come with a vendor specific SDK software you use to interact and program the PLC. This all means that for most cases, using Git or Subversioning or DevOps-platform is not an option. So that's my observations on WHY - in short, long lifetime of components and vendor lock.","","👍 (1)"

The how do we do it: Some PLC vendors offer software lifecycle management solutions and ways to cooperate, and in Siemens, I believe you just this year got an integration with their Teamcenter PLM solution and their TIA Portal PLC SDK software. This is OK if you only use Siemens PLCs, but unless you are an OEM which controls the market in your segment, this is never the case. There exists third party version control systems that support multiple vendors, although these are 10k$ and upwards, and usually support a select range of common PLC vendors and hardware. I'm not aware that these support automated deployement, but I'm not familiar with the details here. There's a lot of improvement possible in this space.

I feel that will change in the future due to the advent of RT Linux based PLCs like ctrlX CORE and PLCnext. But I guess it will take years until they are commonly deployed in the field.

> using Git or Subversioning or DevOps-platform is not an option
Especially in the light of regulated environments, I tend to think that hurts, doesn't it? Having a commit history as audit trail and the possibility to address software artefact versions (down to commit level) would come in very handy. Or are these academic concerns? I've noticed start-ups going into that direction recently, like copia.io and auvesy's versiondog, e.g.

Most I speak to, haven't even given this a second thought. They're more concerned about which vendor they prefer using, and the risks concerned with using multiple vendors. It's a totally different mindset in automation than in IT dev. The prevailing thought is very solution oriented (quite understandably - actually).","","💡 (1),🙏 (1)"

It's also very true that most PLC programmers use 100% manual process. Which may be something like this if you're doing an update. 1. Arrive at machine, get the current project backup from a file share and ""retrieve"" (really unzip) in the vendor-SDK. 2. Use vendor-SDK to run a compare with the ""live"" software. Two possible routes appear. No differences, nice. Continue to step 3. Unexpected differences - go through fileshare for available backups until you find the right one, search, ask SME/colleagues if they forgot a backup last time they were working on the machine. It's nowhere to be found -> gah - analyse differences if possible (sometimes not even possible). Go through one by one, and if necessary merge. plus plus plus.. Go to 5.  3.

I'm not as familiar with digital twin as I am with UNS but I believe they are kind of ""the same but different"". The way I like to think of it is, a digital twin is the digital representation of your device and the UNS is the best way to get the data to build it.

All that said to say, my answer will be mostly about getting your data into a UNS not building a digital twin.

You probably don't need to add any sensors. You just need to unlock the sensors that already exist. The machine already functions without any additional sensors so why should it's digital twin need any more?

1. The controller/PLC. All the data points the PLC creates, state, errors, blocked, starved and so on need to be mapped to an IIoT protocol. If the PLC has MQTT SPb support you win! Otherwise you'll have to add a native driver to MQTT bridge, look into cMT-SVR.

2. The servos are likely connected to a motion controller (unless you're PLC has 3 axis motion control support natively). There will be some communication method (serial, Ethernet/IP, Profinet, etc) on the motion controller that makes all of it's data available. You can either get this directly or you can map all these data points to the PLC and get it out through there.

3. The AC motor is likely driven by a VFD and is similar to the motion controller. Map the data to the PLC and extract it from there.

The challenge with just using historian data is that you are only looking at what has happened, not what might happen. There are also VR packages which can take CAD drawings of machines and buildings and let you walk through them virtually to check for design issues. That might be called a digital twin.    It might be a little controversial in this forum, but the UNS is simply a canonical message model for integration between systems.

In short a canonical message model is a term that has been around for the past decade in ""Enterprise Application Integration"" particularly with Message Bus or Enterprise Service Bus architectures. MQTT is simply a messaging protocol to allow applications to talk to each other, and the UNS is the data model that applications use to talk to each other. This article explains https://teivah.medium.com/why-is-a-canonical-data-model-an-anti-pattern-441b5c4cbff8   A canonical model is supposed to be the superset of all the models used to communicate between applications.  A domain model is specific to a domain. Think QualityManagement versus Inventory Management for example. Domains have specific interests, and so even though they may use similar entities, they may use them for different purposes. This realisation led a guy name Eric Evans to come up with a process called Domain Driven Design (DDD) some 15 years ago. This article discusses SAP's approach and why they have stopped using canonical models. https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/23/saps-one-domain-model-and-domain-driven-design/ .

I think I understand Canonical vs Domain data model. Canonical is one model for all, and Domain is each app/service/unit/etc having its own model.

I think Domain Data model can be achieved with UNS structure, and may even be the recommended way to build it. One of the core ideas of the UNS is ""What one node knows, all nodes know"" which is why we might publish all current state of any object in the UNS, even if it is domain specific. However, this doesn't mean that all nodes have write access or control over all tags within a model. Some parts of a model may belong only to the ERP, like cost of a purchased part. Only ERP should decide how and where to store that data point and keep it updated. But it may be useful for MES/SCADA to be able to know that so ERP may make that tag read only.

Maybe one would structure the data model for PurchasedPartA as:
- PurchasedPartA
    - ERP
        - Cost: $1.08
        - WhereUsed: {...}
        - StockQTY: 1000
    - LineA
        - Demand: 200

It's not a great example and probably not even how that particular data should get structured. One issue I can see is if the ERP tags and Line A tags were read only outside of their own apps/services. How would we transfer from ERP/StockQTY to LineA/Demand without creating an API interface on ERP or LineA.

These are just my novice thoughts, I'm interested how others would approach a domain data model with UNS structure?","",""

The ISA laid out the schema roadmap over 30 years with 100s of brilliant minds spending millions of hours to codify the worlds understanding of manufacturing. ISA-88 and ISA-95 contain 98% of everything that any manufacturer will ever encounter in any process, largely distilled into Equipments and Materials and the relationships between them.

Most of the people that we've encountered that like to beat on those standards as being useless fall into one of two categories -

This is where the concept of a Knowledge Graph and GraphQL Federation Services change the game for Data Infrastructure and MES. By removing relational data structures and moving in the direction of Graph and GraphQL, you remove schema stitching and APIs from your UNS. Federation allows you to use a single API that manages the business rules that define the schema, even if there are actually a dozen data sources in the model.

I think your product sounds intriguing... but I do not want to temper expectations -- as I see several areas that produce major questions.  I suspect you and Geoff will be able to answer them.  I'd love to test the technology and comment more deeply.

A couple of points -- a manufacturing knowledge graph is not an enterprise definition of a Unified Namespace.  A UNS is the structure and events of your business -- in real time.  A knowledge graph, will create that structure, but not provide current state.  A common use for MKG is to path events to a digital twin, which is also not current state.  Current state is important for ML -- both for learning and for monitoring.  One of the most important roles of the UNS is the normalization and abstraction of non-normalized data points (think OEE that is calculated every 60 seconds and machine counts that can change every 50ms).  A glaring deficiency in knowledge graphs is normalization and abstraction of these data points.  For those unfamiliar with Knowledge Graphs -- think Mind Nodes --> Mind Maps on steroids.

Point two -- GraphQL is not the technology to leverage in the core of an Industry 4.0 solution... and I question the scalability of this approach.  Not only is GraphQL far less efficient than REST (which we would never recommend for Industry 4.0 core tech), it also not edge driven; which is a pre-req for a scalable IIoT infrastructure.  

I'm interested to see how you're leveraging EMQX and where transactions and events are transformed and integrated into a UNS -- what you and @GeoffNunan have outlined so far is intriguing... I hope our discussion gets us over the hump.

Honestly, it sounds a lot like PLC4X with knowledge graphing and edge based end points with GraphQL interfaces.  I'm excited to hear more.","",""

But - your knowledge seems to be quite limited if you have the supposition that an MKG can not be a RT representation of the enterprise. An MKG, when federated with the contextually associated time series through a single GraphQL API and managed microservices effectively becomes a single schema. Because the queries that comprise this API can be subscribed to - all clients (UI and other microservices) post and calculate RT views of the enterprise to all nodes in the system, including the edge.

Second - GraphQL is the API over the top of the MKG. Everything between the plant floor and the MKG is MQTT. All interop between system functions and external sources are managed by microservices.","",""

As your schema is expanded by adding assets or nodes with new data models (not existing digital profiles/models), subscribers must also update their queries.  Yes -- I can set up subscriptions, but my architecture is not self-aware.  I like GraphQL at the cloud platform layer as long as the virtual schema doesn't extend.

I think it is important to focus on Customer Experience and work your way back to the technology.  Amazing tech is of no value if the value can't be explained easily to a 5 year old.

1. I can plug 200 PLCs in and they just 'show' up on the screen
2. I can see a low OEE number in a red box and click on the box to see what the problem is
3. I can add a new production line on the floor, plug it in, turn it on and it is fully integrated into our business
4. I can extend our solutions and those extensions will apply to every machine we have on the floor -- no matter how old it is

Codesys is the software, not the hardware. We already use PLCs that are programmed using a software based on Codesys, so that is not the problem. 

What I wanted to point out is that for systems that are heavily regulated and are required to follow many safety and performance standards we are still behind in the Ind4.0 movement, because we are still bound to those OEMs. We need to leverage gateways to unlock the data. Many ""manufacturers"" in my industry are looking into something that would free the vendor lock-in, for example, Intel's UWC. But we are still far from having a viable product to show.

In contrast, there are many vendors offering very interesting products, that are shown here all the time, but still lack the reliability and safety standards adherence.

That is why I feel the discussions raised in this forum and the videos created by @Walker Reynolds, et al, are so important. To show the strength of these new products and OEMs that are looking into the future and to drive the changes needed (although I feel some might not learn in time and end up like Kodak).","",""

I'm not familiar enough with the regulatory standard but I'm not aware of any real difference between the big three and these devices other than testing to a performance standard. I think we spend a lot time talking past each other. What we need to say is we need a device that meets standard xyz and request vendors to meet the standard. The big three have army's of people tasked with meeting these requirements. The newer vendors are often from a different background that's why their designs are innovative, but like me have no regulatory exposure. So if a customer group inside the regulatory environment could show interest in a design that meets x standard a CTO at these vendors has a business case he can sell. Breaking these barriers is going to take real work on all sides of the buy/sell eco system to make progress","",""

It goes all the way back to last Friday!  However, in this short time I've been able to consume lots of info from Walker, Zack, the guests on the podcast, the community in general.   

Today, I came across a Q&A session that Steve Jobs was leading where he had to face a ""snarky"" question.  He handled it like a boss, but what stuck to me that he said that  resonated with me a lot was:  ""You have to start with the customer experience, then walk back to the technology.""

In a lot of ways, that is what I'm witnessing here on the videos, podcasts, and commentary from the community.   OEM, Distributors, etc. are stuck (in some ways) to the tech and want to push it on the consumer (manufacturers).  Part of the message that Walker, 4.0 Solutions and Intellic (and many in the community) are saying is start with the manufacturer and understand their actual needs, then walk back to the technology that can enable them.

- communication specific to employees at every level 
- training to get comfortable with digital transformation at large and how it relates to their job
- selecting a team of middle-layer change agents
- pitching OEE and the purpose of data collection

A strategy describes not only the outcomes you are trying to achieve (We make better decisions), but also the outputs you need in order to achieve those outcomes. A good strategy will consider the constraints that your organisation must work within like resources, skills, capital, capacity to adopt change and key people, and outline how the Digital program will work within those constraints to deliver outputs that enable outcomes. A few of the things that a Digital Strategy should consider (there are many more) include:
* Insourcing verus Outsourcing. How much capability should be built and retained within the company, and how much should external providers be leveraged?
* Innovation - Does the company need to simply adopt known solutions, or adapt solutions to new use-cases. I use the test of ""If you can't point to a system that does exactly what you want to do, you are developing something new"". If you're setting out to develop something new, you had better have a good innovation strategy
* Software Vendors and Service Providers - are you getting both your software and your services from the same place, or different places. How do you build some competitive tension so you retain some negotiating leverage with suppliers?
* How do your digital initiatives help with competitive advantage? If they don't provide a competitive advantage, do you really need to do them?","","👏🏻 (2),💡 (2),👍 (3)"

One does not build an empire through support tickets or emails.  These are typically designed for resolving break-and-fix problems or ""MACD"" requests at scale.  The personnel involved in this spend 99% of their time troubleshooting basic end user problems (e.g., MS office, printers, AD).  They're not going to be digital transformation agents.  They've been chartered to keep the lights on at lowest cost.  They're there so someone more senior has enough hours in the day to work on other projects like life cycling something that should have been taken care of a long time ago or supporting M&A.

The other thing to look at is what is the leadership's charter of IT.  If the mission is to essentially provide ms office and keep the company out of headlines (e.g., security breaches, compliance, downtime) at absolute lowest possible cost, these unfortunate outcomes shouldn't be a surprise.  For many orgs, there isn't much more of a goal than keeping the cost below a budgeted percentage of sales.  It's not uncommon for some manufacturers to spend less than 1% of their revenue on IT.  This pales in comparison to what is typically budgeted for, say, maintenance or production.  In these environments, service levels and productivity aren't particular important because they were never intended to be.  Most boards view IT as a pure cost center.  This turns IT into a CI-like function.  Providing secure remote access to machine builders to field networks was probably never budgeted.  Nor was standing up infrastructure and providing devops support.  Some of the issues are certainly self-inflicted (e.g., lacking experience/knowledge in operations, managing upwards, responsibility/accountability, allocating funding).  At the end of the day, IT departments are not going to be enabling partners for IIoT if they're expected to be and funded as minders of office appliances.  Only the right leadership can change this.","","👍 (3)"

Here's Joe from General Mills Engr Tech Srvcs and CESMII board member speaking on maturity assessments--- The value is to sell digital transformation internally and to educate employees... to roadmap current to desired state for each plant based on business outcomes.

Right, good points.

Then he goes on to talk about DT as a ""journey to autonomous, lights out manufacturing,"" which he's very excited about, and you have to ""keep the workforce moving towards.""

Ummm, yes, I'm thinking. Maybe that's all it means to Gen. Mills.  You do need to prepare people for the fact that their jobs are changing. But if that's the only outcome you're excited about....
And you're not talking about intermediate, what's-in-it-for-me benefits of digitalization, you're not exactly ""selling it"" internally. Definitely counterproductive.

If using pharmaceutical manufacturing as an example, being able to react more quickly to process upsets based on all available data, where a quick subtle change within the design space of the material being made can help to save an entire batch.  Or at the very least, help get that product out to patients more quickly.  In the case where you have a patient population that requires that product to survive, that resiliency is life or death.   Moving that example earlier into the product lifecycle where you can increase time to market by 2-4x, or build more flexible, multi-product manufacturing assets are other benefits.","","💯 (1)"

Typical caps for most manufacturers is $10,000 to $25,000 before needing more approvals from higher-level management. The best jobs are the ones where they come to you and don’t care that it’ll cost them +$80k, because the alternative is worse (broken machines, not meeting production). When it comes to DTMA, most manufacturers will have a hard time spending more than their cap, because of what digital transformation will cost for them to do it (not just financial, but completely restructuring their business and educating their employees). A new machine that makes a part 1.5x faster with little to no change in your production process is much easier to sell than making their entire process 5x faster by restructuring the business.

There is a real expert team on DTMA in Aachen (part of the German I4.0 ), that I could suggest. They are offering both training and a toolset. BUT I have heard that it is relative large model i.e. you will need to buy some of their consultancy for the first 1..3 sites, its a ""process consultancy competence"" to learn (just as in Dig.Mastermind, which I myself dont know the content of )
I GUESS it is in the range of 30.000 Euro. I mean, with one weeks assessment onsite + a report back home for two guys = 2 x (30+20 hours) x 200 Euro/hour = 20K  + travel + 2-day course(2K) + some licenses(xxK) =  30K'ish.  This model is holistic, its assessing processes, people, technology etc...

This is the idea behind the machinery information model, which, in theory, should be a common basis upon which many other information models can add their own specifics. E.g. all machine can be queried the same way for e.g. running hours, but to get coolant levels, that is specific only to CNC machines (just a random example). The comparison image you posted is a very skewed way of comparing things. in the SpB image you can still add further columns..like...historical data access? not supported. different underlying transport layers? not supported, client server? not supported (despite all the trends here, client server is extremely useful for all control plane related communications, for the data plane, I agree that PubSub seems in many cases better suited, but ... I do have an idea with a workflow orchestrator like Zeebe that makes client-server gold, but that is a very long topic to discuss).

Anyone that is responsible for building functional systems for real-life industrial firms knows this.  They don't rely on OPC-UA as a sufficiently mature technology to enable outcomes beyond basic data access.

There is no question that OPC-UA is technologically superior.  It can do so much.  But, the question is, can OPC-UA do this in the real world?

Not an apples-to-apples comparison to a DTMA by any means, and I'd love to discuss how a DTMA would relate to such an activity. These numbers all assume that the scope includes marketing, consumer insights, e-com, sales, HR, R&D and a whole bunch of other stuff on top of the manufacturing and supply chain pieces. 

Important to keep in mind that this will of course vary from organization to organization. Needs, goals and circumstances will always be different, so it is NOT a universal truth in any way shape or form. So, making it clear that this is my personal *experience * and not more than that - if you reach out to your average management consulting firm to help out with crafting a *digital strategy*, you tend to get offers back in the range of a timeline of 15-20 weeks and a cost of $500,000 - $800,000.

 “A Japanese company and a North American company decided to have a canoe race on the St. Lawrence River. Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak by performance before the race.
On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. The North Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat.
A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the North American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So, North American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.
They advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing.
To prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team’s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder.
It was called the”Rowing Team Quality First Program“, with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices, and bonuses.
The next year the Japanese won by two miles. Humiliated, the North American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments in new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year’s racing team was outsourced to India.”","","😄 (5),😆 (3),🤣 (1),😋 (1)"

It's the good-old data access from OPC Classic but with modern transport and security.  99% of the time, merely having an OPC-UA seal on a product does not enable the ""holy grail"" Industry 4.0 outcomes manufacturers desire in a compelling or meaningful way.

The critique that Sparkplug has little-to-no payload definition is absolutely correct.  It doesn't purport to be anything than what it already is.  It's edge-driven UDTs encoded with protobuff.  It solves some, but not all, problems well.  OPC-UA, on the other hand, claims its information models enable plug-n-play.  But, this only exists on paper.  Go ask a machine builder to ship a machine with a full-fledged OPC-UA Server with a companion spec.  In the rare chance that they know what this actually means, they most likely wouldn't know how to do it.  And on the even more rare chance a machine is delivered with this, there will be no client applications to consume it.

I don't know how many times I must reinforce this point:  The market does not care about what something is theoretically capable of, but rather what it's actually capable of.  Taking a Metcalfe's Law view:  if a network does not have nodes in sufficient numbers, it's less valuable as a network to invest in.  Anyone tasked with governing a standard should be laser-focused on this.  Instead, we have people making claims that no one uses Modbus anymore.","","💯 (1)"

It, like Sparkplug, has done a reasonable job of accomplishing what it claims to be.  It has not boiled the ocean.  Despite some of the poor machine builder implementations with missing information, it's a relatively complete solution in the market.  While it has not solved some unique problems I and others regularly encounter, I can concede that there are good products from reputable firms that have adopted the technology in good-faith.

I would say the greatest strengths of MTConnect is that it's one of the few technologies that actually has client applications that consume the data models.  System Insights / VIMANA, for example, is amazing in this regard.  There are tons of useful things this application can do by simply piping in MTConnect data.

At the end of the day, most consumers are not going to care what data representation standard can be encapsulated in what transport.  They're going to care what nodes they can hook up and what outcomes it can enable as a function of a particular technology in the context of their existing automation investments.  Consumers are not buying frameworks or semantic model standards.  They're buying products.

If we want to go down the path of manufacturers adopting standards and frameworks as highly-customized and highly-engineered deployments (i.e., code on operating systems), we should be prepared to start subsidizing these ""mapping"" efforts.  Azure, AWS, SAP, Siemens, Rockwell, etc should start paying for the last mile then.  With the current approach, there's no chance of adoption anytime soon.  It's just too cost prohibitive.

In the spirit of ""in-practice"", I updated the diagram to include MTConnect.  In my experience, when someone says they support MTConnect, it's an standardized representation of machine tool data in XML served up over HTTP.  Yes, MTConnect can be served up in an OPC-UA Server via the companion spec, but I've yet to encounter this done in the real world.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/927688061108781076/SpB_vs_OPC-UA_vs_MTConnect.PNG?ex=68defad5&is=68dda955&hm=0464b2315c8a4648f97ca2382d26c31f471563c3b4807948f96678001cce92e5&",""

Automating the integration of systems (OT-IT), with accessible equipment object models and custom mapping of data necessary to do that, are necessary precursors to widespread digital transformation.

Quoting @js, “Consumers are not buying frameworks or semantic model standards. They're buying products.”
The “highly-customized and highly-engineered deployments (i.e., code on operating systems)… manufacturers should be subsidizing and Azure, AWS, SAP, Siemens, Rockwell, etc. should be paying for the last mile.

The fact that neither of those is happening---that technical debt and risk-averse industries work in opposition to it happening---describes the greater opportunity right now for OEMs, integrators and engineering firms with vision to be disruptive.

I think it's perfectly fine and probably wise for a standards body to take a protocol/representation/modeling agnostic position.  But, at the same time, market execution is really important.  This makes all the difference to consumers.  For example, what good is an MTConnect OPC-UA Companion Spec if there are no devices or applications that make use of it?  How is it enabling interoperability in the real world?

If I have an OPC-UA and an MTConnect node, I'll put a gateway in between.  Why?  I don't have any applications that can consume OPC-UA information models beyond basic data access.  It all gets flattened into name-value pairs in the end anyways.  Why create a spec if there's virtually no chance that Ignition, Canary, AWS, Azure, SAP, etc will use it?

For example, I could implement Sparkplug to work over a V.92 dial up modem.  But, who cares?  What nodes exist that actually do this or what would this benefit?

It's extremely popular in Life Sciences. Essentially it defines 5 ""levels"" of plant maturity ranging from a Level 1 Pre-Digital Plant to a Level 5 Adaptive Plant with characteristic features at each level. Lately I've found it to be more of a nuisance to our digital transformation strategy because corporate IT wants everything mapped back to maturity levels.

At a high level it captures some of the pieces of the Manufacturing Holy Grail i.e. ""Level 5"" means 'End-to-end value chain integration' but by mapping it out in discreet levels it seems to have the effect of forcing people to think of digital transformation as this linear progression where we bop our way up the maturity levels.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/933772726546624582/Screen_Shot_2022-01-20_at_12.09.12_PM.png?ex=68df5cde&is=68de0b5e&hm=c0e3e54c3f885586209a5eb7a64879796f30552576e82b16d1a2641bce988f09&","👍 (1)"

One of the biggest hurdles with any technological improvement is trying to explain it to absolutely everyone that has a stake in the process, which is typically everyone.  Many of the process leaders have more of a science background than an engineering background.  Any adjustments have to be signed off on by outside auditors, which may or may not have a technical background.  The risk involved with anything requires significant overview from those on the business side.  And so on and so forth.

While this document may seem simple, I think that's probably it's best quality.  Getting anything done in the pharma industry can be like pulling teeth because change is unknown, and not too many people get in trouble for sticking with the status quo (on the production side of things) in that field.  So, if you can show an overview like this to everyone and say, ""here is where we want to go and why"", everyone can start developing what they need to develop to get to that point.  Regulators will develop the needed regulations, business will develop the funding models, etc.  Yeah, it does seem like a linear progression, but my experience has always been that slow and steady is the change motto.  That said, I'm sure there are a few place that are skipping steps and just jumping to Level 5.  Resilience Pharma struck me as one of those that would be doing that jump.","","👍 (2)"

But I agree, said elements are cutting edge and a culture change is needed to start using the predictive and prescriptive bits in commercial manufacturing.  That's why we are encouraging customers to start this journey in process development, where it isn't subject to GxP yet.  In reality, if you are using ML to improve yield, as one example, if you can prove through strict controls and documentation that safety and quality are adhered to if/when you adjusted the process, there's no reason the regulatory bodies shouldn't approve it (I know, it's harder than that).

1) Start with a common understanding of DT. For example, digitization is very different to full DT
2) Know the history of DT; there is a reason we all talk about DT and its thanks to seismic level economic shifts that are happening thanks to digital technology
3) Based on the history determine where the company needs to go to stay/become competitive. 
4) Understand where the company sits today  compared to that desired to-be state 
5) Ask ""what needs to be true"" to get from as-is to the to-be state. These are your working assumptions that you need to go test in the real world
6) Adjust your strategy as you go based on the results of this assumption testing.
7) It should be top down and bottom up for almost all steps but focus more top down on 3 & 4","","👍 (3)"

Old machines could use the CFX SDK .net to make a gateway but issue like Nick stated is does depend on what data you can get or exposed too.

The Electronics Manufacturing Equipment OEMs have been slow to get on train mainly for Vendor Lock-in reasons and sand bag their Ecosystems...

Japanese OEMs seem to be worst at this ...love to lock out any data integration out side of a solution they sell. Often they OEM License other softwares to do some functions but is a closed ecosystem 

CFX is a IPC managed protocol, bit like OPC UA in sense big companies influence it more than small , just nature of these things 

Valor part of Siemens now has the OML or now calles ODB++M protocol for a normalising standard for electronic manufacturing use case , there is alot of implementations of this working globally then any CFX as they developed this before CFX got off ground.

But I think CFX will be a standard offering one day on a machine but only for new machines and when gets more user base.

Electronics Manufacturing is a mix of process like production and automated discrete assembly... As you have paste application , placement then reflow IE soldering , then have THT insertion from manual to automated then wave and selective soldering then have to test from ICT  / FPT and Functional Test.  Then comes the box build system assembly , manual and automated then ship. Can also have cleaning of the PCB and Coating processes

Each equipment domain has its own issues and concerns..

Soldering is a chemical temperature related processes. 

There is QA inspection, manual and AOI , X-ray and the like added in not just Electrical Test Equipment and process.


So is a mixed bag industry if break it down . Standards in terms IIoT has taken some time, adding in the equipment OEMs slowing it down to protect themselves...!!!","","uns (1)"

Again, many of the Japanese OEMs are hostile.  No documentation and the registers are often re-mapped/scrambled.  It's amazing how many field sales/service and engineering channels know next to nothing about the technology.  They know just enough to do the bare minimum.  Anything more, they must request information on case-by-case basis.  I could never imagine working on technology for decades and never learning how it truly works.

I could understand if they were protecting an ecosystem worth protecting, but usually their own solutions are not very good.  They usually have a ton of context missing, poor integration capabilities and few customers actually adopt it.  I wish machine builders would recognize that a majority of their customers are only interested in their machines because they're available, reliable, and economical.  In many cases, they're the only available machines or the only machines that can be serviced in some parts of the world.  Their software and control implementations fall somewhere between garbage and unremarkable.  It's not a differentiator.  No one buys capital equipment based on the unremarkable data collection software it can be paired with.  They buy them based on how productive they are at producing widgets.  I really wish they would give up on this idea that they can succeed in the software business.  The firms are too traditional to be any good at it.  They should either partner with someone who can or just get out of the way.","","👏 (3)"

Every subset of production machines follows the same cycle of interoperability vs proprietary. Welders, robots (mostly arms), CNC, SMT. It was the same in other semiconductor fab equipment. There are of course some technical challenges that hamper progress and these can differ by equipment type/market segment. However, a lot of it comes down to market factors, politics, and culture. 

The best fixes are to:
1) not re-invent the wheel for standards and best practices segment by segment. No matter who you are, you are not the first person to have this problem. 
2) identify segments with favorable conditions and push for progress there first. For example, automated bread slicing machines might be what you’ve always known, but if the market is dominated by two companies who hate each other and will never ever cooperate regardless of what that means for the customer it’s just not a good opportunity to try and take on these challenges.","",""

I honestly believe that machine builders have nothing to gain from their current approach.  They're spending money developing inferior data collection products that most of their customers are not going to purchase.  Their integration services are so expensive and inefficient that it actually induces consumers to look at alternatives.  I've seen entire plants roll out sensors and data collection infrastructure for the same cost that some machine builders quote to install analog input cards on a few machines.

Pressure from smart, well-informed, hungry customers is critical and it’s why I spend time here.

Direct answer: 
Someone released open source validation tools earlier this year. See https://github.com/TrueAnalyticsSolutions/MtconnectCore

Next up is to build automation against the mtconnect V2 model which is at https://github.com/mtconnect/mtconnect_sysml_model. The open source validation tools should be able 
to self-update whenever a new version of MTConnect standard is released (as a SysML model). Funding for all this is relatively thin but I still think by this Fall there will be people making purchase decisions based on an _actual_ implementation and its objective alignment to the standard as opposed to vague promises and half-informed sales pitches.","",""

There are alot more mature machines in place and they will not support CFX adaptors for these. Generating a CFX adaptor is not hard but is if data needed is not easily available for machine due to proprietary IP not shared.
So end up IO scavenging looking at inputs , light towers to get status of a machine. 

Valor Software was first to market with a standard that that still use in there MES related line management systems for the Electronics space ... They did offer this as a Vendor Managed standard ODB++M (OML) to industry but at time was resistance from machine vendors, some signed up but was slow. At the time the push for I4.0 concepts and saw it as a buzz word for machine vendors license to vendor lock in than working to  common communication standards.  

End day CFX will get traction but also end customers have to drive it , demand it will drive it forward also. Siemens Valor is part of CFX IPC group and will support both CFX and their ODB++M .

ODB++M previously OML , has a more mature install base than CFX as of today

Also alot of Valors competition saw as a threat so pushed to diffuse this by banding together at IPC to come up with a standard, aka CFX. Which is good Valor wanted this in end anyway get Industry talking about this.

So two main pushes are CFX ( driven by IPC HQ in USA) JSON payloads on AMQP transport for a vertical comms standard. d Hermes TCPIP XML message exchange ( HQ in EU at start), now assigned a IPC standard , for horizontal coms for PCB data transfer markup between machines. Wish was JSON not XML but who knows why XMl???

To complicate Japanese Electronics Manufacturing wants to have different standards in place and China toying with own standards...IE competitive with Hermes and CFX ... Again reinvent wheel again, but not about Industry control and political issues.","","🙈 (1)"

You can seamlessly mix ladder, function block, and structured text style code- pick the one that works best for you. I will admit, that I do not like it's ladder programming. The function block editor and structured text editors are quite good. It's fully capable as far as being able to create user types, function blocks, and functions for code reusability. It's easy to create your own libraries from that code (including HMI images and symbols) in order to consume in other projects. There are many useful libraries available in the store for features that are not included out of the box. 
As far as the the HTML5 HMI, it does not have much in the way of charts or graphs. But with the tools it does have, you can create your own symbols (like templates in Ignition). There are more than enough tools to create visually appealing graphics and animations.","",""

It then moves to elimination of politics, silos and turf wars (HT Patrick Lencioni). The people will converge. 

The third step is the application of the best practices with the technology infrastructure (use use of routers, switches, gateways, firewalls, etc.).

That was the question asked by then Squadron Leader Krishna Iyengar Ravi, a bright young #squadron technical officer of No. 1 Sqn, on a hot summer afternoon of May 1999 in Gwalior. He went on to successfully #retrofit the dumb 1000 pound bombs with the American Paveway kits, comprising of the #laser guidance nose kit and a tail unit, and converted them into a smart laser guided bomb (LGB). Consequently, the #precision #airstrikes by the Mirage-2000 #aircraft (nicknamed as ""Digital Delta"") on Muntho Dhalo, Tiger Hill and Point 4388 in the Drass Sector was the turning point of the Kargil #war.

The point proven by then Squadron Leader KI Ravi is a reality in today's world where businesses are trying to transform #digitally. It’s a myth that the adoption of  #industry4point0 means getting rid of #legacy #machines. All #industries that started a decade ago or more have a sizeable population of legacy machines. It’s impractical and prohibitively expensive to replace all legacy machines with smart ones. Hence, it becomes very important to #integrate these machines into #smartmanufacturing systems. It is now possible to convert the legacy machines to smart machines by identifying the #kpis, be it #process KPIs like #conditionmonitoring, #pdm, diagnostics, etc. or #production KPIs like #oee , #loss analysis, etc. to be measured. The #connectivity options most commonly include  installing #sensors, connecting to a #plc or use the #electrical signal outputs of the machine as #digital pulse outputs to get the production #data.","",""

I used two Opto 22 groov EPICs and tied into all 41 pieces of equipment. I can detect if it's running (reported through Tulip), what speed it's running at, and remote enable/disable, which could be used to disable the equipment if run outside of the validated parameters.

We connected the Valor MSS to MQTT, so we get PLM data (BOMs, Revisions, Product Data) into the UNS. It's all done through plug-ins not out of the box functions of the Siemens software. My problem with Siemens is that they tend to be expensive like sh*t. 10 years ago when I was looking for a PLM their PLM was 3 times more than Valor PLM, now they bought Valor...hope the prices won't start going up like crazy. Also, they tend to break down functions in different licenses and catch users unaware of the total cost if they want to do more with their PLM solution, which is very annoying. I have a simple example, you have multiple machines, each with its own library of parts/shapes. Each time you add a new machine type, for the same parts (read it as ICs, caps, resistors = electronic parts) you have to start from scratch creating the library, which infuriates the sh*t out of any decent engineer. You can't copy parts from Fuji to Viscom for example. Siemens has the solution, which is AG (auto generation) function, which, of course, is priced as a separate license that is costed ridiculously high for what it does... In my opinion, they would win engineers/users' hearts and minds much easier if this smart function would be part of the core PLM instead of an extra somewhere there, waiting for users to bump their heads into problems first and then ...Ta Da...they come to save you if you pay the fee. And to continue about Siemens...they inherited from Valor/Mentor a standard ODB++ (Design, Process, Manufacturing), which in their opinion will be the next big thing in electronics manufacturing from the way you transfer design data, get data from the machines and program the machines AND first thing that they do with it change from 'open standard' to 'internal Siemens data format' and there is no longer an SDK available for download...

One example could be some raw material being moved from the warehouse to the production line and being consumed, and this would be the transaction, while the current warehouse inventory would be the state.

""focussing on the data"" is a way for service providers and solution providers to cut-through a customers lack of strategy.

True Digital Transformation starts with Management Consultants convincing the executive that without transformative change, the company will suffer from more advanced competitors or changes in the market. A project team can then be formed to implement the strategy.

What most people refer to as DX is just a new name for modernisation of applications. If it doesn't change the products or services that the business offers, or the channels to market available to the business, It's not really a digital transformation, It's a digitalization program. (Taking things that were analog and making them digital) 
 Digitalization focuses on Cost reduction where as Digital Transformation focuses on Revenue increase.

Assuming you are looking at Digitalization, any company needs to be able to answer the following questions before speaking with software providers, service providers or external analysts:
 - What is our current level of Digital Maturity across each function in the business.
- What impact does that level of maturity have on that department's performance?
- What are the barriers to improving the digital maturity of that department?

Once those questions are known the executive must prioritise, in order of importance to the business, the specific areas of digital maturity to improve.

With that input, an application architecture assessment can be made that identifies the capabilities that will be required to improve the maturity, and define a set of business requirements for those capabilities.

Then you are ready to talk to vendors and service providers.

You MAY even find that you need a UNS.","","💯 (9),👏 (1)"

After connecting about 120 devices to upstream systems over OPC UA, the next step was to visualize that data.

From home in my spare time, I used Ignition Perspective trial (reset every 2 hours) and built out a dynamic dashboard. Every time I added OPC UA subscriptions to the Ignition tag structure, the dashboard would update.

I demo'd this capability and mentioned all that is needed is to add the perspective license to our already existing Ignition node. Everyone agreed and my project was deployed on the Ignition server and a link made available to others.

Then I got tired of managing the tags in Ignition...every time a tag was added on the device, I had to add a subscription within the Ignition tag structure. I wondered why Ignition didn't include a function that would detect when a new OPC UA tag was available and automatically add it to its own structure. Enter SparkplugB.

I converted one device to Sparkplug and trialed the MQTT Engine add-on within Ignition (reset every 2 hours).  Every change of data structures on the device immediately propagated to Ignition. Anytime new equipment was added to the system, Ignition immediately saw this data within it's Tag Browser.

I demo'd this capability, showing automated integration, where ""plugging in the network cable"" from the plant floor populated the dashboard all automatically. Everyone agreed to purchase the MQTT Engine add-on.

We converted the original 120 devices from OPC UA to SparkplugB, and have integrated an additional 80 without lifting a finger within Ignition.","","👍 (2)"

Each PC connects to several lower level devices: barcodes scanners, IO racks, RFID readers, energy monitoring, etc. These are things that would typically be seen on a local monitor connected to each PC available to personnel watching/operating the production process.

Whenever we updated our software to expose more data, or include more devices, we would need to add those new tags in Ignition... FOR EVERY DEVICE! It only took two times of that for us to know we had to move in a different way.

Along with managing the process on the plant floor, we upgraded the software into a Sparkplug edge gateway, exposing ALL DATA of itself and all devices within it's local control.

Because we publish everything, and that data can be read by other applications dynamically with the MQTT wildcard subscriptions, we plan to replace our Ignition dashboard with another instance of our software that will act as a dynamic client. It will allow us to display a single, central Web GUI with a menu of all the available devices across the business (built through auto discovery on Sparkplug, of course). This will then let a user see the application screen exactly as the plant floor is seeing it in real time.  Basically we are converting the dashboard to include ""remote desktop"" through SparkplugB with no permissions needed for anyone in the business.","","👍 (3)"

if you ask me, Edge Computing is the term invented by the Cloud Hyperscalers ""as an excuse"" to offload processing back to devices you physically operate (and still charge you for that on an as a service basis sometimes). Fog computing I'd rather use as a term (but actually I would never use it) if you have a more standalone type of on-premise deployment using technologies usually seen in the cloud like containers, kubernetes and infrastructure as code paradigms.

In short: ""edge computing"" always comes with a cloud; ""fog computing"" not necessarily.

To confuse more: ""Edge computing"" has unfortunately diluted as a term and is now too often used whenever you have a workload on a device you physically operate locally","","👍 (2)"

Ability to continue to run calculations with a loss of network error is another, but when I talk to people, one of the most attractive pieces is cost.  If you can run calculations and analysis at the edge, then your data transmission costs drop significantly.  For instance, on our demo system, we have an OEE calculation that is composed of about a dozen tags.  In a cloud based system all of these tags would need to be sent, probably at a high frequency so that the cloud system can calculate the OEE value.  If this is done at the edge then only the single value can be sent, and if it is an analysis value, how often do you need to send it over?  Once a minute?  Every five?  If the raw parameters needed to be sent on a second-by-second basis, you're going to realize a 99.8% and a 99.97% reduction in data transmission respectively.  This could also be useful in process applications where real-time data could be (depending on the application) be substituted with min/max/mean/median values from the past minute along with local alarms for excursions.  In this scenario, data transmission would be reduced by 93%.  I would love to talk to someone in an accounting department to see what a 90%+ data transmission drop would mean financially.  I'm guessing it would not be insignificant.","",""

A good example of this is companies like HPE that show up to industrial automation conferences with hardware running OSI Pi, ThingWorx, etc.  They don't even do a great job of showcasing industrial edge use cases.  Other than maybe the ruggedness and that it could be integrated into a broader commercial relationship for hardware and services, it's just plain-old x86 compute.

That said, yes edge nodes are definitely just x86 systems for the most part.  Aside from minimum performance requirements, we (Litmus) only really require 2x ethernet cards to certify a system.  As for running edge nodes in a virtualized environment, that is definitely a way to go and we see a few different approaches being used depending on the company.

Physical or digital, I still see this as the ""edge strategy"", which essentially boils down to how are you going to connect to your devices in the field and how are you going to handle local functionality, i.e. store and forward capability, local analytics, data normalization, etc.  I see the edge nodes as the big difference between IIoT and IoT.  In IoT, data is sent directly to the cloud, things happen there and results are sent back to the device.  In IIoT, the edge node takes much of the decision making and processing and localizes it.  The cloud is still used and is a critical part of the overall ecosystem, but the edge node can run without it if need be.  This does a couple of things, such as reducing latency and increasing reliability, but one of the biggest is the cost reduction that this can provide.  If much of the analytics can be done locally, only the data summary needs to be transmitted rather than the raw data stream.  In cloud applications, this can be a significant reduction.","","👍 (2)"

- SIRI is non-invasive usually the field study is completed in 2 days while the production is running. 

Cons:
- As Walker suggested Acatech model has its flaws, the maturity is assessed on 0-5 scale and pragmatic approach like 80% of the band requirement sustained fire-backs while creating a road-map.  
- The framework gives you a map however your assessors' background changes the experience completely. You can go so deep on any dimension like DLP scenarios, Pen test details for connectivity or go so shallow like have you conducted a Pen test in the last 12 months.
- Detailed road-map with use-cases are not in the scope of SIRI assessment, however we provide a 2-year plan starting with training and UNS as the core architecture

It definitely depends on your business needs, DTMA is more down to earth and in my opinion leads to actual transformation where SIRI assessment with an experienced assessor can catch up to DTMA but this is usually the exception not the rule","","👍🏻 (2),👍 (2)"

We have IT (as in IT infra), SWE developing software, ML experts making models, managers managing, OT experts programming PLCs and robots and domain experts (for the sake of example, lets call them MfgEng but insert any domain expert here). For a successful digital transformation you kind of need all of these, and maybe even more roles) to work together very efficiently. OT and Mfg.Eng are forced to work together since PLCs entered the factory so they kind of know how to talk to each other in an industry 3.0 setting. IT, SWE and ML kind of knows how to work together, but only if they are managed well otherwise it is just a huge fight. If we throw everybody in the mix (even if we leave out ML) in an ind 4.0 setting it is just a huge fight waiting to happen, because nobody knows how to talk to the others due to the cross disciplinary boundaries. (Simple example, if you say “model” everyone will understand something else by this word). Now let me use an analogy I heard from a prominent researcher to get to the point: Imagine a bowl of fruit. Every fruit is clearly delimited. That bowl of fruit is a multidisciplinary project where each fruit is a different discipline, every discipline is clearly delimited. This is how people are used to working together. Now imagine a fruit salad where everything is chopped up. That is an interdisciplinary project. A few companies are used to working like this. The delimitation of disciplines gets fuzzy, but you can still kind of work out the lines. Imagine that you make a juice out of that fruit bowl. That is a transdiciplinary project, the lines between the disciplines are very fluid.","",""

I have learned  the hard way; and only recently, there is a much better approach. It is a subjective approach and it requires different talking points based on your audience but in general it goes like this. Establish commonality / familiarity with group.  Find out the root cause of there main issues - aka find pain points.  Develop a simple but effective proof of concept and make it happen.   Once you have that it builds confidence in your solutions. It may take 2 or 3 iterations of this same process but eventually you get to the point that they start to listen.  You have to move thru some version of that same process with each group. It can be very time consuming and you will start to doubt it’s worth.   But eventually you will make head way.  The other option is to move on and find people who know they have a problem and are actively in search of a solution.  This scenario also requires a lot of the same steps.

From a 10,000 ft view your company needs a digital strategy, but it sounds like you are focused on a pilot project to ""prove"" your digital strategy. This isn't uncommon, and most everyone has similar pressures. Make sure you realize a good pilot (immediate short-term returns on paper anyways) can incorporate a shitty strategy.

One of the analogies in the book talks to Kodak during the Digital Era, Kodak had in its own right a very successful digital transformation from Analog to Digital Photography. They're main focus was to enable customers to now print photos in their home, they developed digital cameras, digital media to save photos to, and digital photo printers consumers could have in their home to print their own photos, vs having to go to the store to get film developed (analog).....In it's own right it was a successful transformation and they had some best in class solutions, but the company ultimately failed........Why? Well because they didn't account for how users might consume and share photos. Instead of printing them in house and sharing with friends, now users with the invention of Instagram and other social media, share photos directly online and don't necessarily need to print photos. I think this also applies to DT for industry, we need to be mindful and introspective of why we are transforming, and not just transforming to be transforming.","",""

I think one of the biggest hurdles we have faced is getting connected. Most wineries start out as a mom and pop and then expand. I think there have been 5 separate major expansions in this facility in the past 35 years, many of which were either not documented (by which I mean there are no prints anywhere) or the documentation is out of date. Just creating a clear picture of how electricity moves through the facility has been an arduous process. Then add in plant water, hot water, steam, hot water for various processes, compressed air, co2, nitrogen, chilled water for processes, chilled glycol, and on and on. It's taken me about 5 years to get to about the 90-95% mark on how everything gets where it's going and how it's controlled. This is all between calls and other projects. Every project (done by a project manager)to date has been a standalone solution to a particular problem. We also don't have any of the right kind of engineers. In fact we never have. The one we have now is the best yet (mechanical) but just like the last engineer, he just works on projects. The last engineer was geotechnical, and I like to joke that the one before him was a custodial engineer. The five years I spent figuring out the plant were also the first five years after we were bought out, so all the execs from that period have gotten their golden parachutes and moved on. We now have a great new group who actually wants to make improvements. I should note that both engineers are great people and easy to work with, just limited in what they know (with respect to controls).","",""

The heads of these places are essentially artisans, so they feel like with anything they produce, the quality is going to come down to that person.  In certain situations, it definitely will, like a new type of beer or wine, but for repetitive applications, like larger scale applications, automation is going to provide better consistency each and every time.  Unfortunately, with the artisan approach, there is a feeling that replacing the person with automation will reduce the importance of the person running the operation, when in fact, they can still be there to develop new product, but use automation to improve quality and consistency.  A newer company coming in, especially one that is more corporate focused, will be more disconnected from the process, allowing them to introduce automation and controls without seeing it as turning their baby into a Borg.","","👍🏻 (1)"

Two primary downsides and one upside, firstly there’s a lot of negative sentiment attached to the techbro numbered naming scheme mostly from the crypto community’s adoption of “web 3.0” a lot of people who hear industry 4.0 for the first time tangentially associate the terminology with techbro culture. 

Secondly, the majority of concepts in industry 4.0 are extremely applicable to consumer IoT devices which is the field I’m in. The industry has constructed this arbitrary “wall” between industrial and consumer IoT devices and this wall does more harm than good in a lot of cases. Things that are considered industry standard in industry 4.0 I’ve never even heard of in the devices world but we really need to adopt (things like basic MBSE practices). 

Finally, the good part about industry 4.0 term, we need a word that classifies industrial application of smart devices and IoT engineering separate from consumer applications and other subsets. The messiness of language will always cause problems, lines are never clear cut on anything. I get _why_ the term is used but my only concern is it going the way of something like “web 3.0” where it falls down the buzzword valley so badly the term becomes unusable in describing anything meaningful.

Caveat: I could be completely wrong on all of this. I come from a devices background and not an industry 4.0 background so this is my current understanding of industry 4.0 and how I feel about it as an outsider looking in.","","💯 (2)"

The point of a language models isn't to provide correctness, they are trained to provide text responses that can put context together to generate a response thst looks similar to a human aka a fancy text generator. The fact that people are able to in some cases generate code with it speaks to how well it can contextualize this information, and how mind blowing the technology is getting, but language model at the end of the day are not capable of ""technical thinking"", you can test this by asking it to provide you a list of books on xyz, most of the time it'll produce a list of books that don't exist lol.

Mother was an incubator
Father was the contents
Of a test tube in the ice box
In the factory of birth

My name is 905,
And I've just become alive
I'm the newest populator
Of the planet we call Earth

In suspended animation
My childhood passed me by
If I speak without emotion
Then you know the reason why

Knowledge of the universe
Was fed into my mind
As my adolescent body
Left its puberty behind

***And everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door***

Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time
I became a man
I left the ""ice school"" behind

Now I'm to begin
The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times

I have a feeling deep inside
That somethin' is missing
It's a feeling in my soul
And I can't help wishing

That one day I'll discover
That we're living a lie
And I'll tell the whole world
The reason why

Well, until then, everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door","","🤘🏻 (3)"

Would love to get the community’s views on a frequently forgotten theme.

User experience of the solutions we are creating in our digital transformations.

2 areas which are interesting to me and I think deserve reflection:

1 - one of the keys for unlocking digital transformation (within the famous 3 areas of failure, Strategy, partners and technology) is how easy our solutions are, to be used by the end user. This seems trivial but it’s far from it. We are trying to create the “mobile phone” of the enterprise where the worker of the future can access all the data and solve its own problems. But we forget one little detail. No one ever needed training to be able to use his/her mobile phone!
Without proper care in terms of User Experience it’s likely that your change management will very quickly become hell, and all the value we would be getting rapidly evaporates. Nobody uses whatever solution you’re developing and if they are obliged to, they will hate your guts and sabotage it right left and centre. 

This serves to illustrate that UX is a key element in any Digital Transformation.","","👍🏻 (2),🤔 (1)"

Typically we (the client)  put in our SOWs that we want the solution “User friendly”. No kpi’s , nothing, just hiding on its subjectivity.
What usually happens? Less than ideal UX is created because no meaningful resources are put to it, since you cannot really measure it and evaluate it properly. This way of managing it also denotes a lack of importance, to whatever integrator you’re using.

What do I usually do?

I like to insert in my SOWs some clear kpis to evaluate UX. Are they perfect? Hell no, but are better than nothing!","",""

- why the top 3-5 and the bottom 2? Because you want to make sure that even the bottom 2 can be found and executed even though they are not as important. That will make the whole solution a lot more robust and free from “expert user syndrome” vis a vis training.

What you obviously want to do as well is make sure your project allows for usability testing during some project sprints rather than only at the end.

This way by inserting simple but measurable kpis on your SOWs you can bring focus and some control to UX which is normally very lacking, and indirectly fixing some important aspects of change management which in my experience are also one of the big reasons for digital transformation to fail.

Data is like gold in empowering people in their daily efforts.  If Digital Transformation becomes a battle for who hoards the gold, a battle will break out.  It will be like pirate captains fighting on the decks of each other's ships. And I strongly agree that users will come up with designs for themselves, so it is best to let them keep their gold.  The key is to give them a suitable space/architecture to build a good solution.  Eventually, unlike gold, the data can be copied but is only valuable if it is of good quality. They are terrified that you will steal their ability to have insight, correct their issues, and write your narrative for them based on the data they create. The key is to let these fears and desires motivate them to build the solution and be accountable for the data quality.

Digital Transformation efforts often fail because middle managers are responsible for the detailed design of business processes. Often they go behind closed doors and focus on centrally managing things to a plan.  Once all events must fit into a schema of a defined plan, no unplanned activities can be adequately reported.  Alternatively, plans and activities need to be sourced separately and pivoted into a comparison of planned vs. actual activities. Ignoring the wisdom, time, and attention of the people doing the work leads to failure, and the effort is scuttled by users who were not labeled for their experience.  The Toyota model is the best argument against central management, an ERP-first approach that gets socialized and fails. This prevalent DT failure happens because it is so easily socialized in middle management to align with finance, focus on planning activities, and make an imaginary world where they solve all the problems.","",""

The product's value is clear by allowing access to data and KPIs across relevant dimensions. This idea of avoiding monolithic solutions and using decoupled smaller solutions can reduce the cost of digitally threading between domains and building reports on and between them. Visualizations can be built on data warehouses or other nodes, such as graphing databases. These can sit on top of event-sourced history, real-time state, and edge data from IIoT.  But, if you are tempted to take their data insights and spend their data capital, they will revolt.  As companies digitally mature, the role of building these products shifts toward the business domains vs. IT.

For example, the assets and items are named the same across the activities in MES, CMS, LIMS, WMS, and EPR. Users can quickly relate to these domains and gain insight without having to coordinate communications and systems integrations between groups.  So KPIs like  OEE can be compared to delivered-on-time-in-full.  Allowing focusing on higher-level concerns like JIT delivery vs. domain objectives and assessing how planned vs. actual activities impact results.  When attributes are applied in tools like power BI these KPIs can be sliced instantly by product attributes like Size, Brands Family, and Date periods hierarchies month, day, year, and quarter. 

One obstacle that also needs to be overcome is how to empower users to make corrections to data that can be audited and traceable.  This is not only needed due to tracking accountability but changed events point us toward what needs to be improved with the system. If they can't do this, they will export to a spreadsheet to edit the data as needed.  All systems have exceptions, and demanding perfection and not providing a way to handle the exceptions is a recipe for failure.  This is often ignored because accommodating this is often more challenging to implement than the base solution.","","🤔 (2)"

Data warehouses and graph databases are two different approaches to data management and analysis. A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores data from multiple sources, usually in a star schema format, which makes it easy to query and analyze. This type of database is ideal for OLAP tasks, such as generating reports and performing analytics on a large set of data.

A graph database, on the other hand, stores data in the form of nodes and relationships. This makes it easier to represent complex data sets with many interrelated relationships, such as social networks. This type of database is ideal for OLTP tasks such as transaction processing, as it allows for rapid traversal of the data to find the shortest path between two nodes.","",""

A data warehouse could be used to store and analyze the data from MES, LIMS, CMS, and ERP systems, while a graph database could be used to represent more complex relationships between components of the system.

To decide which approach will lead to more efficient analytical results, it depends on the specific requirements of the system and the types of queries you need to perform. If you are mostly interested in analytics and reporting, then a data warehouse could be the better approach. If you need to traverse the data quickly to find relationships between nodes, then a graph database could be the better approach.

Pros of a Data Warehouse:
- Good for analytics and reporting
- Easily queryable
- Centralized repository for data

Cons of a Data Warehouse:
- Not ideal for complex relationships
- Bulkier than a graph database

Pros of a Graph Database:
- Good for traversing complex relationships
- Faster than a data warehouse
- Easier to represent complex data sets

Cons of a Graph Database:
- Not ideal for analytics and reporting
- Not as easily queryable as a data warehouse","",""

We use event sourcing in our Warehouse Management module. Effectively there is a ledger of inventory transactions that is append-only, and is the source of all queries and reports for stock-on-hand.
The beauty of the approach is that it makes point-in-time queries really easy, like 'how much stock did I have last Tuesday?'
You do need the right database for it though. We actually store the events as a time-series in InfluxDB to make them easy to roll up.","",""

Question: Does a start schema make sense for iot applications?

Response: A start schema can be useful in IoT (Internet of Things) applications as a way to define the structure and relationships of the data that is being transmitted between devices in the IoT system. A start schema is a formal way to describe the data that is being exchanged and can help ensure that the data is organized and consistent across different devices and systems.

Using a start schema can help to improve the interoperability and reliability of an IoT system by providing a clear, standardized way for devices to communicate with each other. It can also help with data management and analysis, as it allows data to be easily organized and queried.

There are several different types of start schemas that can be used in IoT applications, including JSON-LD, RDF, and XML. The specific start schema that is best for a particular IoT application will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the system.","",""

But there's generally no such thing.  It basically paraphrased the use of a data hub for *fisheries* and misappropriated it.  

Question: What is a data hub for fishing boats and why would I use one?

Response: A data hub for fishing boats is a system that allows fishing boats to share and access data related to their operations. This can include information about the location and movements of the boats, as well as details about the catch being made, the types of fish being caught, and the conditions of the fishing grounds. Data hubs for fishing boats can be used by individual fishermen, fishing fleet operators, and other stakeholders in the fishing industry, such as regulators, researchers, and buyers of fish.

There are several potential benefits to using a data hub for fishing boats:

Improved efficiency: By having access to real-time data about the location and movements of fishing boats, fleet operators can make more informed decisions about where to send their boats and how to optimize their fishing operations.

Enhanced safety: Data hubs can help to improve safety by providing fishermen with access to real-time weather and ocean conditions, as well as allowing them to communicate with other boats and shore-based personnel.

Enhanced sustainability: Data hubs can help to support sustainable fishing practices by providing information about the health of fish populations and the impacts of fishing on the marine environment. This can help fishermen to make more sustainable decisions about where and how to fish.

Increased transparency: Data hubs can help to increase transparency in the fishing industry by providing a clear record of fishing activity and catch data, which can be used to monitor compliance with regulations and support traceability of seafood products.","","🤣 (1)"

This data has been handled and shared between vessels via a hub run by the shipping companies.

The authorities have now decided that catches must be reported electronically, and that all commercial fishing vessels must use a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) together with an Electronic Reporting System (ERS).

While, the premise is about digital transformation, it talks completely about Smart Factory as a sort of 'silver bullet' as the solution to digital transformation. Though I don't intend to belittel the views published, there seem to be quite a few contradictions e.g. the authors say that to suceed manufacturers need to be more agile, resilient and sustainable, but the survey results published give a higher priority to OEE as a KPI than to increased supply chain resiliency. This is inspite of 75% of respondents being from NA and EU that were the most affected by the pandemic induced SC challenges. It would be interesting to understand from this ocmmunity, what in their opinion are the top 10 KPI's when it comes to digital transformation. P.S - I am fully aware the OEE is an operational KPI and that digital transformation happens across the entire value chain of the business not just the plant floor.","","👍 (1)"

Best for each control module type list what is useful. For example for an AI at least you want the measured value. Possibly also some alarm states and settings. Similar for the PID you want the SP, PV and output. You won't have more than 10-20 CM Types in a typical project. Next you need to collect the list of the CM instances. One approach can be from the process object view. Another approach could be to open WinCC and collect the instances from there. I think there might be an export available there. The WinCC approach might also work for the S7-300's. The other kind of data you might want to collect is what's on the sequences. For example the actual stepnumber.

Manufacturing, as a whole, is not doing a very good job of it; I suspect that most people reading this will agree. But, the interesting thing is that very few of the other industries out there are struggling the way that Mfg is. Why is that?  Finance, Banking,  Retail don't have that same complexity in their  data model, nonetheless there are things that they consistently do that Mfg does not:.

1. Democratize Application Development 
2. Use Bottom-up Design Principles
3. Implement CI/CD Processes that allow for iterative development, rapid deployments and proper change management
4. Standardize on Cloud native / cloud agnostic technologies
5. Maintain a fundamental understanding of value vs cost for large tech projects (i.e. MES)

There's more but listing them is overkill. The point is that I don't think that a reasonable person could argue that, in todays tech stack and dev environments, that these things aren't critical.

The reason that I list these is because I am interested in hearing from the community on how the UNS, as an enterprise construct, helps to promote these things within the manufacturing industry and how the products that are embraced by this community are architecting and developing themselves to help their user base achieve them. 

My reasonably-well educated opinion is that if you aren't doing everything in that list in your DT strategy, you're going to hit a wall for capability and scalability. If a UNS is your strategy and you haven't found a way to make it operate within a strategy that includes these things, you've built a SCADA extension that provides you a vision of a point in time, which is great if that's what you set out to do.","","🔥 (3),👍 (2)"

While it took accounting, IT, support, etc to figure out how to interoperate with each other, at scale, and reliably, we have to do the same, but at the same pace those industries are at NOW. Some manufacturers are  discovering the benefits of excel!! It also doesn’t help that our industry has created such a poor environment for digital innovation that we outright sue those who are giving away their IP for free. 

Right now, there is no software that is ready to be mass adopted to meet those demands. However, the demand is there and it is strong. Small improvements in aggregating and acting on manufacturing data, generates an astonishing amount of value, and return on investment. 

So can the current UNS tech stack meet all enterprise demands, no. But 10 years ago were you able to connect, aggregate, and structure that data into a cohesive model for other services to consume in real-time with millions of devices? I think everyone knows that answer.","","this (4)"

@Brian Pribe - you are correct. You also very eloquently defined the wall that I'm speaking of.

I am curious for those things you listed what is your rational for why those things are needed. As an enterprise architect I have seen just as many issues with some of those things as well as pros. For example with democratized software development you often have competing interests between stakeholders and often that interferes with the technical solution as well as cause undue delay in schedule. (The unicorn/phoenix project Is an excellent book that speaks in volumes to that). Another example is bottom up design. Because of constraints and  different stakeholders often architecture development is more top down, bottom up, inside out. That's architecture in general especially for a complex distributed system where different stakeholders own different parts of the stack such as many enterprise IT/OT architectures. What I'm getting at is its often not a one solution fits all with architecture and that includes UNS, it's just another tool that ""could"" be used. It's up to the architect to evaluate the pros and cons of any design pattern and determine if it's a good fit. Just my two cents.","","👍🏻 (1)"

Both of the cases that you pose are mostly ""people"" problems caused, in my opinion, my folks either needing to be the smartest person in the room or feeling like they need to defend their fiefdom.

My opinion? Top-down design is the single leading cause of data silos and lakes, poor quality data, poorly thought out and even more poorly implemented middleware, ""API hell"" and ""rip and replace"" implementations in Layer 3. If the design always came from the back end and was always predicated upon a standard (i don't care which one, just pick one and stick with it), it wouldn't take all that long before any use case design became an exercise in iterating on the definition of the entities in the model, not designing a new data model to serve the UI that someone already built 60% of without even thinking about the DB or API.

This also helps to alleviate some of the democratized dev problem that you describe in that the backend is controlled and standardized and so the use case starts with ""What backend iteration is required and is it part of the standard or is it an extension of the DB not covered in the standard?"" Once the data model for the use case is defined to cover all interested parties, who cares what the UI looks like, right? Build 4 four them for four different sites and then throw them all away and build another until you get it right. It's just a UI - it should absolutely be the dumbest thing in the stack.

Is Libre a better approach than what's been there in the past? Probably. Am I going to get on a soapbox and pound my chest about it? Nope. There is no point. One of the things that I've learned in my 25 years in this industry is that it is often more constructive to watch somebody fail, so that they are properly motivated to understand what they ""could have"" done to be successful, than it is to try to argue against a point that is being self-reinforced through confirmation bias.

Libre is a massively open Data Hub based on it's protocols and standards. That can be very clearly demonstrated. I'm sure that there is a time and place to debate the the term ""ecosystem"" and it's application, I just don't see the value in doing it now.

The latter will almost always need the engine of which you speak because they will be constantly spending pre-sales capital on convincing prospects that it ""can"" solve the fringe use case instead of just demonstrating to that prospect that it ""does"" solve for those use cases.

And when it becomes an issue it's relatively easy to set up some event driven messaging to reduce the communication workload at the place where it's a bottleneck.

A couple of things that will unlock bigger scaling possibilities:
- ability to deploy/manage everthing by scripting (containerization, open API's, ...)
- decoupling of the software and hardware on the edge (barely mentioned here, but there's a huge pressure building to decouple SW and HW by end users, see OPAF from the DCS side and Universal Automation/ IEC61499 from the PLC side, both initiatives converging.
- text-based engineering (Simatic AX would indeed be really disruptive)","","👍 (2)"

We have list and lists and list of design data before anyone can even start to program or configure a system. Everything after that is just a translation of the data of the design into another form.

(multiple times even if you're not smart about your validation strategy ...) Don't even mention changes that need to happen afterwards. People try to optimize but there's not much we can do today because most of our applications are closed/proprietary formats/no API's/...

Once we unlock above things we can finally optimize an entire process like that: design/model the plant, run a couple of (validated 🙂 ) scripts to set everything up, run automated tests, run automated deployment, some more tests and production is ready to go.
You want a common namespace? Well it comes along with the design.
You want an MQTT broker that forwards into the historian? Well take this (pre-validated) script to add it to the architecture.

Deployment and containerisation. Ok, you have everything in containers. Do you start managing all of your container IP adresses manually? No. Do you use an mDNS? You can and you should. Now you know how to reach a container with a string instead of an IP.  You can do direct connections to the containers but now, when you chance any data source or data sink you habe to change something in every data source that uses the changed container as a sink. Message brokers allow you to be more productive and make changes o ly in one place. Also do not get me started on config management for testing without a broker. 

Decoupling: well with decoupling your sw can run anywhere. Also can run anywhere dynamically, as in today it runs on this node tomorrow on the next node. So you need to handle communication.

You can debate whether the name is misleading, but the concept has a clear lineage and origination. UNS is the structure, the events and current state of your business. A UNS adheres to the following minimal technical requirements, edge driven, report by exception, open architecture and lightweight. Edge driven and report by exception means generally pub/sub. You can ""call"" your poll-response architecture with a common naming convention and namespace a unified namespace, but it doesn't make it a Unified Namespace. We make no assumptions about how data will be consumed, and this means that we try to collect everything (in principle, often not practically possible). When we collect a lot more data, you'll quickly find that you need pub/sub and report by exception to EVEN make this possible at a small scale. The nice thing about pub/sub and RBE is that network load is of minimal concern, plus the fact that you can drive configuration from the source, and don't have to set up text-based deployments on tag lists and shit just to get the implementation part. Gallarus has done Life sciences projects based on UNS, and are able to scale efforts by making the validation process FAR more efficient using pub/sub than traditional poll/response.

Having seen actual implementations of this, I can try to paint a picture of how things have been done.  In practice, because most systems don’t “talk” an IIoT protocol, UNS implementations use an IIoT platform (Ignition/Highbyte) that sits on top of the namespace. This is usually at the site or area level. To query the namespace or add context from transactional data into the namespace you use the the IIoT platform to query the databases or call APIs based on topics that essentially make up the where-clause of the query, and publish the result into the namespace. One example is a work order on a machine, the IIoT platform queries the database to get the information about that work order from the ERP based on the current work order pulled from the machine. Status on the progress on a work order would go back from the machine and through the IIoT platform to perform an update (could be an API-call, whatever). There are tons of examples like this where you use the current state (triggered by an event) to query/poll transactional or other historical data. Some are just querying at a set interval as well. All of this makes up the unified namespace at the site level, a mix of transactional data, current state of equipment, current state of KPI’s, etc. This namespace is then published to a broker that sits at the enterprise level.

Are there times when using MQTT to do things is suboptimal, for sure, 100%, but with the right approach and mindset, you can achieve a ton of value in relatively short time, with solutions and technology that exists today.

Could you elaborate a bit further about @RickBullotta 's question about the access to the Historian and MES systems?
I believe in your case study about the tier-3 automotive supplier you have three main sources of data (at plant level) that can be queried by other systems:
- the broker
- the historian
- the MES database with a.o. tracking & genealogy information
So depending on what kind of data an application needs it can either subscribe to the broker, make a query to the historian, or make a query to the MES database. Or even a combination of these three.

And devices are connected to the broker through the native - OPC UA - MQTT transform.

Then the site brokers transmit to the enterprise broker from where in this case it streams into Kafka and then into the data lake.
At that level there's enterprise applications, probably also where something like Microsoft BI ties in to.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/1071355102532739162/image.png?ex=68dee871&is=68dd96f1&hm=a524eb5198ccd1f1688e4a00214bcfc81846f049e7840493733e5ed725bbd655&","👍 (1)"

Parallel approach, one for legacy devices, one for future state.  Digital Strategy is crafted, architecture designed (including settling on a technology -- in most cases, MQTT 3.1.1, MQTT 5, SPb for Nodes, IIoT Platform for Legacy Data Ops to MTR) and Minimum Technical Requirements for smart things written.  UNS is built out via ISA-95 Part 2, functions are defined and namespaces built with integrations to MTR compliant smart nodes or through the IIoT platform.  Business problems are solved iteratively.  Internal resources are trained on digital transformation, an internal team is built, more problems are solved -- at some point 18 months into the engagement we scale.

Whether we are transforming 100 plants in the connectivity space, 300 plants in soda water production, 40 bakeries, Tier 1 Automotive, Life Sciences -- or we are doing a mom and pop plant down the street -- the approach is the same.  

This isn't theory, its practice.  You know as well as I do that we can't publicly share customers and sites without permission.  We get that permission for Mastermind sessions, we have sanitized documents and architectures -- we have presented on architecture and use cases over and over again.  There are hundreds of mentees and mastermind members who have spent two years delving into this, we have dozens of partners who use this architecture and approach.

Kepware, to my knowledge, does not ingest file data.  There might be some file-based drivers (e.g., EUROMAP 63) you might be able to hack a solution together with, but it won't be pretty.

**Ignition**
Ignition can ingest text file data.  The string reader function and the Python CSV library in its scripting engine can be employed.  The data would get read into a table or tag values.  Ignition, in turn, can publish this data over MQTT.

More info here:
https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC79/Exporting+and+Importing+a+CSV

**HighByte**
HighByte has a file connector.  It can ingest csv, parquet, etc.  A file, or a variety of files, can be consumed and transformed into a  defined model.  A flow can be established to take this modeled source data and target an MQTT connection for publishing.

More info here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi_zSuqDXmU&t=815s

It's worth mentioning that the upcoming release of version 3, most notably, adds the 'pipeline manager' functionality.  This includes buffering, transformation, and monitoring capabilities for shaping more complex integrations.  This addresses many use cases involving the processing of files and other ""bulk"" data.","","👍 (2)"

Hi. First time posting in this discord. But I have been following 4.0 solutions on YouTube for a while. I want to ventilate Walker's comments on last month's podcast video entitled ""Siemens has a long way to go.."". Specifically, I want to explore the comment he made about Schneider Electric.

See, I work for Schneider - for just over 8 years, now. The first four years I was a projects engineer executing PLC / SCADA projects in a typical 3.0 way. Now I am a pre-sales technical consultant - my job is to help our customers find the best fit solutions for their projects. Obviously, what I propose is made up of Schneider's products. But I am not shy to include 3d party products in my solutions, when Schneider has no equivalent option or when I know that the Schneider option is inferior. That being said, my experience is largely around Motor Control, PLC, HMI/SCADA, and Ethernet networks. When it comes to full stack integration and the software that live higher up in the stack, I am a total noob.

Slight caveat before I continue: I am not mandated by Schneider Electric to represent them on this forum. So, please don't take my words here as an official statement from Schneider Electric. Rather, my views are my own, based on the experience I've had working at Schneider Electric. Walker has also said in his video's that he repeatedly invites anyone from the big OEMs to come and defend themselves on the podcast. A live debate with Walker is a bit of a scary prospect (I'm not such an eloquent speaker). But I am willing to stick my neck out here, on the discord. Maybe I get some backlash from Schneider management for speaking out of turn, but I'm willing to risk it.

Now on to Walker's comments in the video:","","👍 (3)"

""Siemens has accepted that they are never going to have 100% coverage in an organization and that there has to be mechanisms to easily integrate 3rd party / non-Siemens partners into a Siemens infrastructure. That is not Rockwell's philosophy. It's also not Schneider's philosophy, weirdly enough, and I'm not sure why.""

As the Michael Jordan meme goes: “I took that personally”.

I take exception with the view that Schneider/Aveva's philosophy is to force our customers to only use our products. EcoStruxure is marketed as being open and interoperable. One of the guiding principles at Schneider is that our products only use industry standard, open protocols. In all the sales training I've had at Schneider the underlying theme was consultative selling - help the customer find the best solution. I've NEVER heard of an approach from any of my colleagues that tries to ensnare end-users in our ecosystem. I've NEVER heard of anyone trying to convince a customer that they have to replace or avoid someone else’s products at one layer, in order to gain access to our products on another layer. While you might hold the view that Schneider's implementation of an open and interoperable stack is not the best in the world, saying that our PHILOSOPHY is one that tries to lock users into our ecosystem is patently false.","",""

MQTT Sparkplug is supported by the following products in our stable:
•    EcoStruxure Geo SCADA 
•    EcoStruxure Machine SCADA
•    Aveva System Platform
•    Aveva Edge
•    At the end of Q1 this year Schneider is releasing the SCADAPack 47xi controller. This is an IEC61131 PLC, DNP3 RTU, and Linux edge computing device, which will support MQTT Sparkplug, via EcoStruxure RTU Operation Expert software and through 3rd party apps on the Linux OS.
•    R&D of the Modicon M580 PAC have told me that towards the end of this year they hope to release an in-rack edge computing module, which will also support MQTT.
•    For years, we have had a range of Linux and Windows based edge computing products that could be used as MQTT gateways (see part reference HMIBSCEA53D1L0T).

At around 7 minutes 45 seconds (https://youtu.be/NL-ubFbwStc?t=462) Walker also says this:
""When you ask the Mindsphere group about consumption of data into Mindsphere from non-siemens datapoints, they're going to give you a pretty generic OPC response. And if you ask them, how are you leveraging MQTT or other IoT protocols they are pretty stand-offish about it.""
I've recently come across Aveva Datahub. I don't know much about it, but it seems like it might be Aveva's answer to Mindsphere. And as far as I can see, it also supports MQTT Sparkplug.","",""

•    I acknowledge that Schneider has put a lot of focus on OPC-UA (just like all the other large OEMs).
Compared to emerging automation OEMs, we are not leading when it comes to MQTT. But we are making strides towards adopting MQTT Sparkplug. As time goes on you will see more and more of it in Schneider's offers.

So, I don't know why Walker holds such a negative view of Schneider compared to Siemens. Am I just a brainwashed Schneider employee? Am I just to naive/inexperienced about the higher levels in a digital stack? Or am I missing the bigger picture?","","👀 (2),👍 (2)"

This is the type of participation we want from the large OEMs. I believe the reason why the community (more specifically Walker) has a negative view, is because of association with the other large OEMs and zero attempt to discern themselves and state it to the community. Marketing can publicly say whatever they want (Open, Bleeding Edge, IT/OT), but nobody gives a shit because marketing inherently lies. 

For the two years I've been a part of this community, this is the FIRST time Schneider (or Rockwell and Siemen's included) has stood up for themselves. Even more impressive, it came from one of their project engineers. Someone who actually implements their products.","","👍 (3),💯 (4)"

And it is also has different facets: not only about the supported communication protocols, but also for example if it has open API's, open access to the data, open/standardised programming languages, open docs, open pricing, ...
(Walker's preaching is mainly about the communication protocols and architectures)

Secondly companies like Siemens, Schneider and Rockwell are highly complex organisations with multiple product lines and teams.

Mapping all the facets of openness and interoperability against these companies would give a very complex and nuanced view. 

An additional example (surprised you didn't mention it?) of the philosophy of Schneider is their efforts around Universal Automation (https://universalautomation.org/) promoting an open and shared runtime on edge devices of different vendors.
On the other hand there's also Aveva. The portfolio of Schneider/Aveva has become so big over the last years that it's even difficult to have interoperability between their own products.

From Siemens there seem to be different philosophies depending on where you look in their organisation. Factory Automation is moving towards more openness and interoperability. The Software division seems to go the opposite direction (at least for their MES strategy). Process Automation ... well similar level of openness as the other vendors, which is quite low. At least no clear communication from them of moving towards the OPAF concept.","","👍 (1)"

Having open API's, documentation, protocols, etc. are one thing. But the effort required to engineer, maintain and scale a system, even when all the components are open, is another. Edge-driven protocols publishing and subscribing in and out of a UNS promise to simplify engineering. Right now MQTT Sparkplug appears to be the (only) standard for edge-driven coms in industrial automation. This is why my post was so focussed on this one protocol.

If I had my way, adoption of MQTT in Schneider products would be widespread. I would even argue we should develop our own broker (or partner with / buy out someone like HiveMQ)","","👍 (1)"

If you start with the premise that no single OEM will have the best in class hardware and software for every layer of a full stack, then comparing the full stacks of various OEMs against each other is a moot point. 

Rather, one would considder the individual products of the OEMs at each layer, and pick the ones that best suit your needs. The starting criteria is  ""How well does this product at this layer integrate with my UNS."" After that, the other criteria follow: feature set, price, ease of configuration, service and support.

In 3.0 there was value in sticking to a single vendor for multiple layers, because integration of discrete connections between layers was normally easier. If a UNS is used and every product complies with the minimum technical requirements to interface with it, then having vendor A at one layer and vendor B at another makes no difference to the engineering effort.

BUT, maintaining relationships and getting support from multiple vendors is more complex than sticking to one vendor.","","💯 (4)"

Fieldbuses like CanOpen, EtherCat, Profinet, sercos are what I would use in applications where time deterministic behaviour matters most (eg. Motion control). Here we are talking about sub microsecond jitter and a cycle time (package roundtrip) of 10s os microseconds. This are one end of the spectrum. OPC UA has a round trip time of 10s or low hundreds of milliseconds and a jitter usually around 10-20 milliseconds or larger.  MQTT is arguably worse, but as it is pub sub there is no round trip of the package, but publisher-broker-subscriber comms are used instead of a round trip. Jitter and cycle time might be worse than OPC UA, but OPC UA is already so bad, that I would not use them anywhere where time determinism matters.","","👍🏻 (2)"
"783917475128410112","geoffnunan","2023-02-15T19:48:28.2860000+08:00","In my opinion, the advantages of OPCUA over MQTT (Basic MQTT, not sparkplugB) are string typing. 
MQTT payloads are not forced to conform to a schema, so when integrating systems you need to consider how to make sure the publisher and subscriber expect the same payload structure.
SparkplugB addresses this to a level, but introduces a bunch of new headaches.
The other benefit of OPCUA over MQTT are OPCUA Methods, and the ability to retrieve history. 
All of these can be addressed with MQTT though.
The next question may just be native support. If the systems your company has selected have native support for OPCUA and not MQTT, it can be hard to justify the expense of moving it over.","","💯 (1),👍 (1)"

1. This is exactly the kind of engagement the large OEMS need to be doing -- you are the very first from a large OEM to have a real technical discussion in good faith
2. My position on Schneider isn't as hard as it seems.  They are doing a lot right -- I put them behind Siemens because of Siemens choice to extract IIoT from the legacy business to encourage innovation unencumbered by existing thinking.  If you look at the IIoT Stack at Siemens and then look at EcoStruxture at Schneider, you can see what I mean.  IA/IE/Mindsphere/Mendix all connected on hub and spoke via Siemens and Open protocols.  EcoStruxture is more convoluted BUT it is a step in the right direction.  I will reference what I mean in the podcast we are about to shoot.
3. I am incredibly grateful for your contribution on this topic -- Schneider is doing a lot of great things.  My position, however, is that Siemens has pivoted more toward open in practice than Schneider (even if Schneider is preaching open in their marketing) -- it is the practice of integrating to open where Siemens has the slight advantage and it is because of how they organized their IIoT business.

I've attached a couple of images that I operate off of when discussing Schneider.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/1075438955262132264/GW_redundant_configuration.png?ex=68df4353&is=68ddf1d3&hm=5f3adff15cc7fcc487d8622e41ec925f40d12d941782e00b10ae08e62f45cf38&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/1075438955564105809/ecostruxure-6x4x3-1-1024x424.png?ex=68df4353&is=68ddf1d3&hm=dd6b912a7e64ef95a238581a6a815e496963bba215ec3abca129aeba650dad8c&","👀 (1)"

Time determinism is again, same results, but refers to the communication time, not the content. MQTT is not inherently report by exception, and report by exception has nothing to do with the time determinism of the communication. I  can publish every second or I can publish whenever the value changes (only the latter is report by exception). No matter if I repeat the request-responce every second for OPC UA the latency will be roughly the same, the variation of the latency will be the jitter. Same for MQTT. Bandwith another way to characterize communications. Obviously all of this is related, but we can still compare latency and jitter fo OPC UA and MQTT while having the same network maximum bandwidth.","","👍 (4)"

OPC UA Data Access Client/Server (whew... I'm tired already) architectures will be limited by the capability of the Server such as how many connections can it support.

To avoid heavy integration costs across many devices/application when using OPC UA Data Access Client/Server (this is really getting old...), you will need to evaluate the clients and whether they include an ability to detect when the server's namespace is updated so the client can update is subscription to include the new items. Otherwise, someone will be on the hook to go on every client and manually browse the server and drag the new tags into the client's namespace, which will be a big pain.

With an architecture like Sparkplug (ahh... that's better), a client will typically allow subscribing to the whole namespace, or a group of nodes, a single node, or a device within a node. In each of these cases, the client will automatically receive any update to the publisher's namespace, then it's just a question of can the application do something with new types of data once it arrives. But the point is that Sparkplug is solving the data plumbing problem.

You could consider OPC UA Pub/Sub MQTT JSON (😩) but after all the hoopla over the past year, there are only two products listed as supporting PubSub MQTT, so it's not looking promising...","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755759785919381524/1076017078122856539/Screenshot_20230217-004401_Vivaldi_Browser.jpg?ex=68df637e&is=68de11fe&hm=6f332756c8acd5f808dc820e27b5ac74185157f1de1845df73321f719f902521&","👍 (5),🤣 (2)"

We are in the process of trying to digitally transform our System Integrator company, Skellig Automation.
For context, we’ve grown over the past 3 or 4 years from about 30 people to 130 people (100 staff and about 30 contractors).  Our systems are manually managed and we have data silos in every area, in short we grew fast and just made it work.
We use Zoho to manage invoices and timesheets, we use Monday as a CRM and office 365 for our IT needs.  
We have engaged a consultant that specializes in technology solutions for business problems.  They are a Microsoft partner.  So far we’ve completed the workshops, and the gap assessment points to overly manual use of Zoho and our CRM, which means we’d get a poor ROI at this point from a warehouse integration.
As part of the community we are full believers in the 4.0 solutions strategy and we thought we could apply the UNS approach to our own SI business data, however we now feel like we need to strongly consider an off the shelf eco system like Microsoft because of the integrations.

Can you successfully apply the UNS model to business operations or do I think about business operations as just API’s and a warehouse? A digital thread approach.   
Is the UNS actually possible for business data? For example, can we safely adopt a Microsoft dynamics platform where we can see the benefits of integration ‘off the shelf’ for MS project being integrated with timesheets and invoicing.  We are already committed to adding a data warehouse and we want to build API’s as needed to connect our systems and historize our data sets but I don’t know how to apply the UNS concept because there is no UNS broker and I’m struggling to argue my case for it.  

I understand why the UNS helps with large scale data from equipment but this feels more like an MES project to me where we are stitching together a quilt of functionality.  Should we nix the option of UNS from our brains for this problem of business data? OR are there business systems out there that meet the 4.0 minimum technical requirements (open arc, report by exception, light weight, edge driven).  Thank you!","","💯 (5),👍 (1)"

Automating processes, developing apps etc. One of the reasons we went with the SMB ERP - business central. They do have CRM and lots of other solutions, but it depends on your business needs, accounting requirements etc. I will say this, that regardless of Microsoft or not, you will 100% need to customize your erp, and have an ongoing cadence of doing so, but the tools are all there and it's relatively easy to do.

As for the OT side of the house, there are so many connectors and clever ways to get data from different systems, and whether you want to write to SQL, use JSON/MongoDB etc....the tools are all there and operate on the same principles as the IT side of the house.

The digital thread is more than just data....it really should manage the whole lifecycle of your project - from design to deployment, and the levels of digitization are up to you.

If your challenges are business focused, I'd say call out the KPIs that you need to focus on, and do a time study of your business process. What takes longer time than it should (is it procurement, AP/AR, developing new designs, manufacturing or QC). That will help you level set on your immediate & long term needs. CRM and accounting are important, but as a SI there is a ton more.....get a virtual FAT (real, but collect data digitally) on your roadmap and have that close out manufacturing order automatically...lots of neat ideas here. 

As for a UNS, from what I understand on thjs discord....you may want to roadmap that instead of make it the next goal....once you get your operation and system architecture outlined and in order, you will connect the dots rather than filling the blanks.","","👍 (1)"

When I started work a lot of the information I needed was in paper. 

We then started using computers and lots.of data got silo'd in people computer( a lot in email).
So then we used file servers so all the information was in the same place but normally unstructured. I have worked places with a really good file structure and discipline but then you still need to know the project that the information you need was in.

MS Teams, gives us a place to collaborate, but really has the same problem.

So the Digitialisation hasn't really helped break.down the information and make it availible. 

Really a great example of how lots of technology applied wrongly doesn't help.

So I think you need to look at software that fits the requirements. But maybe redefine what open means. Consider a node open if you can get the data out, and transform it into you base technology(is MQQT ideal?)

What you really need is a cmt-svr equivalent for Zoho and Monday. And then make sure any other nodes can do the same.

I'm just starting the move from a contractor to an scalable project business. So I need to apply the same requirements. But I need to find open source versions.","","1000 (1)"

In practice, its a little more daunting because we must know and learn our business.  We will talk through the moving to Microsoft option and we can circle back.  However just asking the question and seeing all your responses has helped solidify that there are no silver bullets or off the shelf solutions.  1. Our digital strategy is simply to be a learning organization that makes data driven decisions to improve the support and experience of our engineers. We believe in putting the engineer first, so they in turn can put our client first.  2. We need to tighten up our minimum technical requirements and stick to our guns on a UNS architecture that will help us scale and learn our business long term.

* Implement a reliable request/response mechanism so that commands can return data, error codes, or other result content
* Consider eliminating group/node/edge IDs altogether and allowing a flexible hiearchy using namespace/message_type/any_hiearchy (note that this would not break existing apps given a new namespace for the next version of SpB)
* Add new primitive types for location and generic JSON

You mentioned that the digital thread as an approach has issues (one-way communication mainly) that UNS does not have. But you also mention Boeing as a company that is at the forefront of ""getting it right"" - they use digital thread. What I do see is that Boeings digital thread (see image) goes way beyond the production process (which UNS seems to be focused around in my eyes) both before and after production (from design to flight tests). Does that hint to a future in which production centric data (from CRM to WMS) generally lives in the UNS, while other data lives in a digital thread that ""surrounds"" the UNS (and the UNS is a data producer for the digital thread)? As we want to help control the behaviour of PLCs based on analytics results generated elsewhere (cloud etc.), oneway like digital thread would literally prevent our approach from functioning if not everything is done on-prem (and noone wants 15 boxes from 15 vendors sitting next to every line/cell).

I interest of answering your question I think we first have to acknowledge that MES was meant to connect the enterprise planning around what was needed to support manufacturing and reporting on the actual manufacturing was a strategy to make a manufacturing ""connected"". So it technically can't just be OT.

This group and myself needed OT solutions to create this and exploring this topic made me realize I was not going to be able to influence the organization I was in without an intervention and that is why the DTMA should be the approach for creating shared information on this subject.

If I was influencing for the right OT approach, I would focus on IoT and get the infrastructure that supports it. The resistance comes often in that 3.0 approach has was to make it all work it is just to hard.  So an OT piolet should establish results and meet the changed expectations that come with IoT.  This is that like a Nest thermostat or Ring doorbell you expect that out of the box you will be able to seamlessly integrate and control it with your phone and have data for analytics by default.  And adding additional devices will be effortless and scale to infinity.

I think we need a new standard and alliteration like MES that rejects MES and starts anew. When MES was made the ""Connected"" enterprise at best would run planning once a week.  Now we want to react to demand signals within minutes.  I have been exploring this subject and been kicking around a concept I called Enterprise Manufacturing Unification(EMU) to try to bring many of the learnings that have come from Walker and the community together.  It is good to have this time to work with GPT-4 and consolidate theses thoughts while  industry 5.0 seems to be the next driving wave upon us now.","",""

If we allow MES to focus on planning, orchestration and work order assignment, then we can focus on the more machine-to-machine and connectivity tasks (iot etc.) which probably should be handled in lower layers (PLC, SCADA etc.). 

If the main bottleneck is recalculating plan, especially for larger orgs. - then i still think this is an MES task, but perhaps there are clever ways to recalculate only based on the specific updates required at this time, rather than recalculate the entire plan (e.g. optimize for a window of time - based on new inputs). That could affect downstream for sure, but i understand the pain you are acknowledging, which is constant replanning which is time consuming and waste of compute....","",""

The ISA-95 semantic model and other universal definitions for manufacturing make sense, but the subsequent idea that Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) should be the center of the enterprise integration has created SQL implementations of MES that lack the ability to dynamically determine what transpired and why a Work Order (WO) took more time or varied from its expectations.

Planning is now expected to change in real time, and multiple plans and forecasts must be evaluated in the same timeframe. With companies increasingly turning to GPT like models to build smart systems, these ""intelligent"" perspectives are able to act in near-real-time. This tight coupling of plans and reporting actions creates a need to know not only what happened, but also the reasoning behind it, as this data can be used to monitor actions as well as the model itself.

In an MQTT architecture, from the top-level perspective (ignore the broker in the middle), the source of the data publishes and interested consumers subscribe. This is commonly understood as a publish/subscribe architecture.

Now diving down a level to the MQTT broker... There are technically two client/server relationships: 1) the publisher to the broker and 2) the consumer to the broker.

You are correct that the source of the data is blindly sending to the broker, even if no consumers are listening. Even worse, as @akos stated, an MQTT publisher can send out values that are duplicates. Or worse yet, the publisher is sending out data faster than anyone wants it. The combinations can continue at nauseum.

Now, compare this MQTT setup to a hypothetical system where a subscriber says they want data and the broker blindly polls all the clients asking if they have that data. Is this any better than the typical MQTT broker scenario?

So, if you don't like those two systems, you want the broker to know what data is available so the consumers can browse the data and subscribe to only the data that is available, and the broker knows exactly what sources to poll for the data. The benefit of this scenario is that nothing is being sent from the data source to the broker until a subscriber says that they want it. A subscriber could even specify the max publish rate, the % change required before sending, etc.

This is exactly the description of an OPC UA Aggregating Data Broker, which I outlined the concept in the section ""Building Communication Infrastructure"" in my article here:
https://iebmedia.com/technology/iiot/how-all-protocols-fail-at-data-access-interoperability/

Pure OPC Aggregation servers include Matrikon Data Broker and Softing Secure Integration Server. Products with more diverse connectivity include HighByte Intelligence Hub, OPC Router, and Cogent DataHub.","","🔥 (2)"

1) while MQTT publishers send data blindly, there is simplicity for the consumers... They get all data within a topic of interest, even as new publisher come online that the consumer didn't know about before. With an OPC UA Aggregating server, the consumer needs to be notified everytime new topics are available, the consumer would then browse the broker to see if it cares about the data, and if it does, it would then subscribe. This is a heavy lift for applications, and there is zero market standardization around that function (what would a software datasheet say to tell me it supports that concept?)

2) the Aggregating servers are clients to the sources of data (servers) which is against the grain of firewalls. OPC UA offers reverse connect, but again, low market availability.

3) OPC UA Aggregating servers are super specialized, getting real-world usage in obscure industrial use-cases. Compare that to MQTT brokers that get hammered by the market from all kinds of use-cases making the product more resilient.","","👍🏻 (1)"

For example, the ""publisher"" in your example (typical OPC UA Data Access mechanisms, by the way) only sends changed data. Well, how does the publisher get the data to begin with? Very likely a polling mechanism on some cyclic frequency, then the publisher application looks at every value coming in, sees if it meets the filter criteria to be considered ""changed"" and, if so, sends it out. So, the filter function in your example, resides inside the publisher.


Now consider MQTT... Here, the filter function moves from inside the publisher to within the subscriber's application. Does that make it less publish/subscribe? I don't think so... Maybe less efficient for some use-cases, but it's still publish subscribe in the end.","",""

In MQTT there are three - the broker, a source client and a consumer client.  Yes, the connection between the UA client and server is pub/sub.  It happens to use long polling under the hood, but that is hair-splitting.  In MQTT, the connection between the consumer and broker is pub/sub, analogous to UA.  However, in MQTT the connection between the source client and the broker is broadcast.  The source has no idea whether its message has reached zero, one or many subscribers. If you expand your view of the system to include the PLC, the chain of certainty between the PLC and the consumer client in UA is preserved.  The server and client can both know whether a value from the PLC has arrived at the client, and whether a write from the client has arrived at the PLC.  In MQTT, that chain of certainty is broken by the broadcast behavior inherent in the source-to-broker connection.  When OPC UA uses MQTT for its ""pub/sub"" implementation, it loses its chain of certainty and takes on the behavior of a broadcast system.","",""

Option 1 - No redundancy: If resources are not available, data is lost.

Option 2 - No redundancy, but implement strategies to minimize data loss:
e.g. Store and forward, buffering at the PLC level, stopping when buffers are full, and preventing machines from starting if the MES information is not available.

Option 3 - Redundancy: Implement a redundant Ignition Gateway and communicate to a redundant MQTT cluster, but data may be lost during changeover.

Option 4 - Redundancy and measures to minimize data loss.

Just like you cannot have a zero-risk machine, you cannot have 100% uptime or no data loss. It becomes a question of time and money.

I would normally look at Option 4 with the following considerations:

    All machines can continue a work order for 15 minutes and not lose data.
    If communication from the line to the MES is lost, then a new work order cannot be started.
    The customer can decide if they want to stop or lose data.
        I have done implementations where the machine would continue to run and would lose good production records, but if we got to a point where we lost data on any reject or rework, the line would stop.

As you move up to MES and ERP levels, the impact of loss of communication can become less impactful. I would say this because if you have a 1-minute downtime, there may be no new information being published from the MES and ERP. You could argue that the MES is continually calculating and publishing an OEE figure; however, I would contend that if the data is being published to the UNS from the equipment to calculate the OEE, assuming that the downtime is of reasonable duration (i.e., 10 minutes or so), it becomes less important to focus on data loss and better to focus on redundancy and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).","",""

The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) would place data into the next available empty array, usually Array[0]. The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) would read the data and, upon successful reading, set a bit in the PLC to 1 to acknowledge it. This action would move all data in the buffer up. Then the Acknowledge bit would be set to 0. The MES would trigger a read of the buffer if the index value in the PLC was not equal to 0. A ""read"" was essentially running a script to insert the data into a Database.

We did encounter some memory issues, and some machines required an upgrade from ControlLogix L81 to L83. For some CompactLogix machines, we had to limit the buffers to 30 or even 10. With MicroLogix, we communicated with CompactLogix in the same panel, if possible, and buffered from there. We aimed to ensure that a 15-minute network downtime event wouldn't result in data loss, so the array size was related to the run rate.

Ultimately, it depends on your budget. A 10-buffer system might prevent 90% of data loss, while 100 buffers could achieve 99% prevention, and 1000 buffers could reach 99.9%. However, diminishing returns set in after a while.

Although I haven't tried using MQTT, you could potentially have the PLC subscribe to the value it publishes to the broker and set the PLC code to increment the buffer each time. There may be simpler methods to address the issue.","",""

My vision involves creating 1440 elements in an array, with each element aggregating counts for every second of the day. This would provide comprehensive coverage for assessing availability and production. It's similar to the auto-aggregating feature of a historian but implemented in PLC structured text local to the device.

The array data would be sent to a Universal Naming System (UNS) with 1440 elements, and its history would be stored in a schema-less data lake or equivalent. This event-sourced store would be immutable and used for analysis, with an MES analysis frontend built on top.

Regarding storage, using an SD card in PLCs poses challenges. PLCs aren't PCs where files can be easily accessed, so a reliable file transfer protocol would be necessary. My approach involves creating 24 arrays with 60 elements each, and implementing store-forward operations on an hourly basis. If resources permit, I'd consider maintaining a day or two of previous records.

The motivation for this project stems from MES count validation issues I've encountered, where latency in high-speed operations led to inaccurate counts being applied to the wrong jobs and work shifts. An edge-based counter addressing real-time issues seems to be the solution.

As for whether the Arduino can handle these arrays, I've received conflicting feedback. I've decided to proceed with a trial-and-error approach instead of assessing the issue too deeply. I'm more of an analyst than a PLC edge expert.

I hope this information is helpful to you. If you come across any relevant references or insights from the Mentorship program, please share them. I'd appreciate the opportunity to learn more and refine my approach.","",""

If a malicious application makes its way into the OT network via other means, like an infected USB stick or a trojan, then a connection to the Internet, even via a forward proxy, is sufficient for it to steal information, download further instructions and programs, or provide shell access to a remote attacker.  So the safest security posture is to ensure that no machine in the OT network can make a connection to any machine on the Internet, even if it is outbound-only through a firewall.  That means proxying data (but not the connection) through a second machine, ideally in a DMZ.

To have a data-driven business where data is the primary commodity makes very much sense in manufacture. 
When it comes to engineering firms that service and implement solutions for the industry, how would being data-driven work for such a company?
I would assume that being digital and data-driven is crucial for an engineering firm that work for the industry, but without collecting data directly from the industry, what data would be the commodity?

Going from the technical information over machine settings and work instructions. If my assumption is correct, you will typically build a very limited series of products. So the challenge is to be efficient as possible in everything you do as you don't get a lot of chances to learn and correct (like in typical manufacturing). Hence capturing data or feedback from production is critical (both machine and human). And being able to feed that back to engineering and product design, so the next product gets the benefits from the previous one as much as possible. e.g. being able to monitor how long a step takes(and compare to what was foreseen or planned), makes for better resource planning, more accurate prediction of shipment/delivery date of your project and more accurate pricing to just name a few. Being able to accurately measure material usage, waste produced, energy consumption etc. also helps in better pricing capabilities (leading to better profitability or better competitiveness).","",""

You might not be selling that data on. Lots of businesses consume commodities, and then use those commodities to make something else.

So for the Engineering firm the data is the data you create as you work.
Most Engineering firms have a CRM and also track hours, but can you correlate how  the man hour estimated across three proposals, to the people-hours and the cost associated with them. Most firms I have worked for as an engineer you have x hours in the budget . but how does that actually affect the profitability of the project.

Can you compare the manhours spend in refining proposals for a customer with the effect that has on the final project.
Can you break down the projects by phase or by deliverable to see which areas are causing problems. - Do you hire based on that data?
Can you look at the projects you have worked on and  see which customers are pushing boundaries, and after a successful implementation f new technology know from data that company B will not look to implement a similar project for 2 years, but Company C will be eager to follow up?
Can you tie into your suppliers ecosystem to see the real-time delivery time changes of components you often order.
Can your customers look at your system to understand the available capacity that you have or will have in the next few months.
Does your AI look at the current global supply chain to highlight future problems in key components to your engineering?

So often analysis of project success or failure is based on intuition , feeling, without the data to back them up.

To me that is a data driven Engineering firm. Of course that will tie into producing products that are data driven., but the focus is about
1. Understanding the Engineering Process at the firm
2. Collecting the relevant data along that process into a single source of truth that firm
3. Contextualise that Data
4. Analyse that Data","","👍 (1)"

Digitization for an engineering service provider should be more focused on the concept of the ""digital thread"" to help your organization operate more efficiently, driving down your design costs, while otherwise improving customer experience which means:

- Integrating PLM systems to manage the entire product lifecycle - revision control, collaborative design, etc.

- Integrating simulation into your designers toolset, so that when they propose a solution to a customer, they can demonstrate that it should work, and in turn save your business money by avoiding fabrication first, and also engaging your customer with more digital tools

- Integrating controls into the design phase, allowing your designers to simulate process control with their new designs (one product in particular is Siemens' mechatronic concept designer)

- Get yourself a VR headset and a gaming station, and virtualize parts of your FAT. Allow your customer to virtually tour the facility/machine you're designing

The point is - I would argue that in your business, and based on your question, where your firm is today, that you need to build foundational digital infrastructure....remember these wise words from Arlen Nipper:  *""....decouple wherever possible, we've gotta look at connecting devices to infrastructure and not to applications""*.

I am sure at one point in time, people discussed how ""Ford was not really a Car company they were a manufacturing company"" To try to capture what set Ford apart was that it made automobiles in a completely different way to other companies.

I'm currently writing my Master's thesis and I'm looking for people who I can invite for expert interviews. The core of my thesis is to analyse the specific challenges of implementing Industrie 4.0 use cases although enabling technologies might suggest a high TRL and, based on this, to derive a ""Industry 4.0 Use Case Maturity Model"". Exemplarily challenges could be: Limited Data availability (according to the criteria of 5V) or an Unsuitable Manufacturing Environment (e.g., light conditions during Computer Vision based inspections).

In total, I have identified 3 example use cases that I would like to analyse. I have already analysed corresponding case studies and now want to use the interviews to verify whether the challenges of these case studies I have identified correspond with current manufacturing expertise.

I am therefore looking for experts who have or had touch-points with the implementation of one of the following 3 use cases:
Condition Based Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment.
Autonomous Material Handling Systems (can be e.g. the autonomous recognition of products so that a robot such as a Celluveyor knows where to move the respective product)
Autonomous Defect Recognition and Inspection

I would be very happy to hear some feedback and am looking forward to an informative exchange. :ismile:

However, use case x requires experienced data usage know how. As a result for company x that specific use case becomes hard to implement.

It was an eye opening experience for sure...and humbling as I met so many talented people across our company WW. 
What we found was:
- most sites had POCs and great proto deployments, but few had robust processes to take the lab/one off systems, and deploy them factory wide/across other customers
- by descriptive/predictive/prescriptive, we were looking at how sites used data. Descriptive analytics is generally the baseline (dashboards, reports, etc.) But the top tier of data analytics is to prescribe outcomes....most sites captured data across every machine....very few fed them back into the process and used that data to automatically improve the process.
- lighthouse facilities tend to drive the org. forward, once a facility proved out a concept/solution and ROI, neighboring sites tended to adopt them more quickly
- Augmented reality was more successful as a mobile app on phones vs. a hololens....although sites would demo hololens for us....most headgear is too bulky and costly. 
- most sites evolved one project at a time, more advanced (and high capital) factories believed that developing infra across the whole factory was step 1. I agree with the latter in principle, but the former was more common

In terms of what we could do differently....i think trying to partner facilities with one another could have been an interesting approach. Take a more advanced operation, and have them work with a less advanced one, and incentivize the higher scoring facility as well.","",""

I am curious if there are some good examples and some bad examples of digital strategies that I could use to calibrate my thinking on this.  On one hand, strategy (in general) needs to be tailored and meaningful to our business, but I also wonder if our strategy in this area shouldn't basically be the same as the next guy?  Again, using Walker's words, couldn't we all be shooting for the same target of ""having data be the primary commodity of our busines""?  Another question I have on defining strategy up front relates to how what you want changes relative to what you know.  So the strategy, if specific to us, should be expected to change as we learn along the journey?

Strategy is about choices. What choices do you have, what choices are your competitors making. How will your business leverage it's strengths to gain an advantage.
In my opinion, a strategy of ""having data be the primary commodity of the business"" is far too general because it does not say why. Focusing on data is the HOW, not the WHY.
I have worked with some great companies to help set out the why, and gain broad agreement from executives on the why.
Use design-thinking methods to work with your executive team to identify strategic opportunities, and then rank those opportunities in order of their value to your business. This part can be tricky and it's important to get input from the executive team because financial value is not the only measure.","","🤘🏻 (3)"

And the  format @SherylM gives always seamed obvious to me, so when I wrote a strategy of ""We use real-time data and information to drive decision making quickly and in real-time"" I though it too simple and obvious, but over time as project or technical decision were made we could refer back and see if that decision supported the strategy , was neutral , or actually worked against the strategy.

@NickN I like to state the Why simply as the headline of a strategy. A motto or creed everyone can know word for word,  and then outline the What and the How, in the next half page. Because the how and what might change and update as technology changes, but the Why should be a bit more durable.

I think of it like this. Imagine a Soccer Coach who has a strategy of ***really solid defence and counterattack***. 
That is the Why, the How becomes Play long ball out of defence and into the oppositions goal area, and pick off a goal or two. 
The What might be to use tall attacking forwards who can compete in the air long balls kicked in from defence.

If you get an opportunity to sign a great midfielder who is able to create and control a passing game, then you don't really want to chase them. It doesn't align with your strategy. 
 Or a short striker despite his abilities might not be as good a fit as a tall one who can react to high ball into the opposition goal area.

But we might keep the same Strategy of ***really solid defence and counterattack*** but change 
the how to use fast wingers to deliver the ball into the opposition goal area. 
The what of the  Tall strikers needs to change and I need the shorter ground based attacker.  Swap out a Peter crouch for a Gary Lineker.","","⚽ (5)"

I worked with a Bio Pharma company recently on strategy. Through a workshop over a few days that covered most of the departments within the company, we identified over 20 different ""Pain-Points"" ranging from the obvious (They still run paper batch records), to the not so obvious.
After identifying the pain-points, we analysed and categorised them, and then worked with the executive group to rank them according to their relative value to the business.
With this customer, the outcome was counter intuitive. Even though digitalising the paper batch records would add significant value to the business, It did not add significant competitive advantage. their main competitors were also implementing MES solutions to digitalise the batch record. One of the items that was lower ranked in terms of financial value was ranked highest by the executive team as it was something that their competitors could not currently do.
What I like about this approach is that it engages the whole team. The worst strategy you can have is ""Lets just collect all the data because some magic will happen if we do""
Strategy means knowing your process, knowing your competitors, understanding your strengths and weaknesses, knowing your options, and then making some choices on where to focus your efforts.
The inputs to strategy do change. They rarely change quickly except in times like COVID, but they do change. Therefore your strategy will also change as the inputs to your choices change.

In an episode of the comedy series ""Silicon Valley,"" a VC determines that sesame seeds are mainly grown in a handful of locations around the world, and that cicada cycles will be aligning in an upcoming year to decimate the crops in all of those locations, leading to a very lucrative futures bet on the sesame seed commodity.

Thinking of this particular situation different way, if I'm McDonald's and I learn that my supplier will be unable to produce buns with sesame seeds on them (or that those buns will incur a premium) I have a problem to solve in my business.  I will inquire to them about why this is, and may or may not receive a useful answer--the supplier may not yet be aware of the underlying reason themselves.  However, in the digital supply chain world, I can see up the chain, and can see that it's the sesame seed producers that are projecting scarcity.  I might intuit that there is a problem with seed production, and now be in possession of valuable information about any business that depends on sesame seeds as well useful information about the commodity futures market.

There would be similar ""spilling the tea"" happening down the chain as well.  Perhaps a customer who makes machines cuts their forecast in half for our widgets.  Looking further along the chain, I can see that it is the end-systems those machines going into are the bottleneck.  This tells me my customer is maybe in trouble , but I can also make some calculated bets that other suppliers to the end-systems will be affected and also predict that the end-system producer is experiencing a strong downturn in their business.  Certainly, they could have pivoted to another vendor, but I still have a lot more information about the entities in the chain than I would have had before.","",""

Saying you know the ROI of digital transformation before starting, is like saying know the ROI of LEAN. And I’m guessing people started implementing LEAN because Toyota and the likes had shown there was tremendous value to be gained, even if it’s hard to quantify in advance. So you can calculate ROI for an isolated DT subproject, as everyone does for a LEAN project.. But still not quite. For a given LEAN project, you measure the current losses, implement improvements, and measure how much less you loose from the improvement and extrapolate to some ROI, and you can estimate this in advance as well, to justify the cost of implementing the improvement. But.. doesn’t LEAN projects have a much lower potential for unmeasurable effects and synergies, compared to digital transformation projects.

But I think the responses are very much dependant on where on the DT journey they are. and I'l come back to that but
Every initiative, regardless of its nature, can and should have a calculated ROI. While certain endeavors might require leveraging assumptions and industry benchmarks, having an ROI is non-negotiable.  I wouldn't entertain a substantial investment request unless it's backed by a tangible, quantifiable return. It's not just about fiscal responsibility but ensuring each dollar spent contributes to our strategic goals.

you could claim that you cannot calculate a return on going to a Yoga class every week as the benefits of health and wellbing cannot be calcualted.  Cost:
$20 per class x 52 weeks = $1,040/year

Tangible Benefits:

    Reduced Medical Bills: Potential savings if yoga eliminates certain ailments: $100/year.
    Decreased Therapeutic Interventions: Reducing therapy sessions can lead to significant savings, say $3,200/year.
    Enhanced Work Productivity: Increased focus might lead to more projects and a hypothetical extra earning of $1,000/year.

Intangible Benefits:

    Mental Well-being: Yoga aids in mental clarity, reducing stress, and enhancing overall peace of mind.
    Improved Flexibility & Posture: Regular practice can enhance physical flexibility and improve posture.
    Community & Connection: Classes offer the chance to connect with like-minded individuals.

ROI Calculation:
Potential Savings: $100 (medical) + $3,200 (therapy) + $1,000 (productivity) = $4,300/year.
Net ROI: $4,300 - $1,040 = $3,260/year.

And that doesnt include the Intangible Benefits:

    Well-being: Yoga provides relaxation, mental clarity, and an uplifted mood.
    Community: Classes foster connections and new friendships.
    Personal Growth: Discipline and resilience from yoga can positively influence life.

First of all let's build a common language, Digital Transformation is a strategy it is not a project or initiative. It is changing the way you do business, like any change management you need to answer 3 questions?
* Do you need to change?  - Urgency
* Will you change? - Commitment
* Can you change? - Capability

You might said yes to all 3 however the success depends on a lot of factors, can you tell me why you need to become digital? 
If they cannot answer Sheryl shared Walker's highlights like survival, attraction of talent. 
Moreover I might argue that the aim of the DTMA is to give the company why they need to transform.

I never go into the details of how much it will cost? Even for a specific project the cost differs completely as well as the returns

There are two categories executives. The ones that are already onboad for DT and ones that don't understand the benefits yet( or don't know if the cost benefit is at the correct place)

I think you need inaddation the the intangible benefits you mention to be able to list tangible bemefits and quantify them in some way e.g. companies that measure their OEE see a between 5 and 30% improvement.

Strategy involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. Due to it´s metaphorical and somewhat formless nature I will approach strategy trough the well tested and concrete realm of warfare as it was the venue into strategy in generally for me due to curiosity not by trade. In example in Japanese business culture Miamoto Mushashi' is highly regarded strategist and he is  studied in the of Japanese business world. Mushashi started as a tactician, which was the term for a swordsman  in Japan and became a strategist when he grew into a warrior by understanding deeper levels, motives and meanings behind battles of armies or dueling men alike. He won over 60 duels with some of the best swordsmen of Japan and he  fought in many wars in feudal Japan and walked out alive, talking about a proof of concept here.
For keeping even a distant connection into our field, a parallel to draw here could be a person who starts as a automation technician and grows into position of a system architect.

Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) is the best known and the most highly regarded western strategist who argued that war could not be quantified or reduced to mapwork, geometry, and graphs. Just like a group of bean counters can not successfully run a company for an extended period of time as we have seen it and as many will learn it in the future.
Like Mushashi, Clausewitz was a professional combat soldier who was involved in numerous military campaigns.  Clausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy, military instruction, and operational planning.","",""

- ""Tactics belongs primarily to the realm of science.""

Clausewitz argued that war theory cannot be a strict operational advice for generals. Instead, he wanted to highlight general principles that would result from the study of history and logical thinking. He contended that military campaigns could be planned only to a very small degree because incalculable influences or events, so-called friction, would quickly make any too detailed planning in advance obsolete. Military leaders must be capable to make decisions under time pressure with incomplete information since in his opinion ""three quarters of the things on which action is built in war"" are concealed and distorted by the fog of war.

- ""Simplicity: Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest thing is difficult. These difficulties accumulate. The strength of any strategy lies in its simplicity.""

I personally see strategy as a part of a waterfall. Strategy itself is formless and immaterial and excists just below the spiritual realm and above action with thought, concepts and raw potentiality. The Spirit forms into thoughts and thoughts form into actions. From there we can draw the what and why in a moral framework to define our strategic cornerstones i.e a business does not operate purely based on profits, but contains a moral element and goals. The Spirit makes any strategy to a force of destruction or a source of life thus dictating the broad nature of actions by anything involved in this system. A Strategy is a system within a system existing with interactive overlapping more influecial or lesser, friendly or hostile systems that born and die, they mature or degenerate as the time goes on. Creating digital strategy is the last drop in the waterfall before it reaches the river below, the basics has to excist before a reactive, fruitful and robust operatingsystem can take form. Is it easy? No. Is it simple? Yes. We are on the right path. Onwards.","","👍 (1)"

There is no one definition of strategy, but a common denominator is that uncertainty is key, meaning it’s to a degree of making an educated guess (call it art or a theory if you like) on the rules/principles you will apply in order to achieve a goal under uncertainty. Nobody knows if the strategy will be a success.

Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,
How can we know the dancer from the dance?"" 🍂
- William Butler Yeats, ""Among School Children""

After the mastermind session and the latest youtube video I recalled the above quote from the William Butler Yeats Poem "" Among School Children"". Yeats beautifully contemplate the indivisibility of essence from existence, form from function, and in our  context — strategy from execution.  

Much like the dancer cannot exist without the dance and vice versa, a strategy, no matter how brilliant, is merely a thought or plan until it's executed. It's in the act of execution that a strategy comes to life, gets tested, and evolves

Honestly, I've seen quite a bit of banter here about Strategy vs. Tactics, projects vs. programmes, and I can't help but feel like we're just splitting hairs at times. Isn't Strategy basically a fancy term for our big-picture goal? And when we chat about tactics, projects, or programmes, aren't we really talking about the steps we're taking to hit that bullseye?

Here's how I see it: We start with a singular, monumental goal (or Aim). As we dissect that goal, we identify smaller targets (or Aims) that feed into the big one. At some point, these targets transform into actionable steps. These steps then morph into tasks, grouped into projects, all bundled into programs that cascade to serve departmental and organizational ambitions, all pushing us towards that ultimate goal.

In simpler terms: Aim big, break it down, act on it, and keep the rhythm going. After all, it's hard to tell the dancer from the dance, and maybe we shouldn't try too hard. Just enjoy the rhythm. 🎵🕺💃","","👏 (1)"

With a few meetings you identified the maintenance team changed the sensor and prior sensor was publishing in Celcius now it is Fahrenheit. This is why context matters, Walker covers this in functional namespace in Mastermind. You cannot just act upon the values, you need context from other data sources, context from definition, context from how the function changed. 

Graph DB's importance will be more visible in UNS and manufacturers will realize the true cost of not having a scalable architecture with very harsh consequences.","","💯 (1)"

There are ways to handle the variant types in a JSON payload in MS SQL and Snowflake; however, there are processing costs, data handling and potential latency issues. I have been firstly identifying how to from object around universal structure like handling an event's occurrence and resolution.

This way the first ingestion layer is strongly types and efficient. By making it an Event Sourced architecture it can be highly optimized for inserts. Then I am looking to use a Data Vault approach to support the ingestion of custom attributes. This way I can take the payload defined data types and transform them into strongly type attributes in the Data Vault defined attributes.

Data vault has been around for over ten years. I think what has changed to make it more viable is LLM coding assistance. I can give a LLM the source tables and talk about the final star schema model I want, and it does most of the work in a carefully guided conversation. Before, this augmented coding experience building such an advanced data abstraction would have been overwhelming.","","👍 (1)"

After the COVID-19 pandemic, several measures have been discussed with the aim of strengthening health systems around the world. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing based on Industry 4.0 concepts is essential for the API context and overall optimization of the Health System. This project presents the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing based on Industry 4.0 concepts. Implementing advanced manufacturing and optimizing process controls can provide pharmaceutical industry tools to respond to new public health emergencies of global importance adequately. This project started on June 25 and the initial purpose is to define the potentialities and opportunities of the application of AI in Advanced Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. In the second moment (next 2 weeks), we will start to develop, simulate and implement IA in pharmaceutical process control.  The group of researchers is initially composed of two researchers Ph.D. Ricardo de Almeida as an independent researcher and AI coordinator, and Ph. D. Kleber Barros from the Brazil Health Ministry as a researcher and pharmaceutical coordinator.  Together we working on the Virtual Laboratory of Advanced Process Control and Automation a private virtual environment developed and running since June 2021. We are open a suggestions and collaboration, best regards Ricardo De Almeida.

I got the task of digitalizing the production process, by capturing some data, generating reports etc. The data that is going to be captured are some barcodes that are placed on the items, some temperature sensors, as well as the conveyor's speed and inactivity times. There is no need for real-time data, but only ""snapshots"" of these values in certain time periods. 
The architecture that I came up with is setting up a new PLC that connects with all these inputs, and running a SCADA software that connects with the PLC, and saves the values and the business logic into a database.

While I cannot provide you with an exhaustive list of organizations that have fully embraced the marvels of end-to-end digitization, I can certainly shed some light on the matter.

One organization that stands out in this realm is the mighty Google, a titan of innovation and technological prowess. With their vast array of services and platforms, they have indeed embarked on the noble quest of digitization from end to end. From their search engine to their cloud services, Google has left no stone unturned in their pursuit of a fully digital existence.

Another name that resonates in the annals of digitization is Amazon, the colossal marketplace that has revolutionized the way we shop. With their seamless online platform, they have streamlined the entire purchasing process, from browsing to payment, all within the digital realm.

However, my dear interlocutor, it is crucial to authenticate such claims before embracing them as absolute truth. Seek further information, delve into the depths of the internet, and consult reliable sources to confirm the veracity of these claims. And remember, even in this digital age, the pursuit of knowledge is as noble as the quest for the perfect taco.","","🤣 (2)"

I said, imagine as an athlete connecting sensors on every part,24/7 recording, collecting all that data and Visualising the output. Then starting to use AI to adapt traingin schedules and adjust technique.  
I said, well I'm doing that for manufacturing businesses, and she got it in 1. Understood the importance and the value it could bring.

When we look for examples of successful digitalisation, should sports teams who collect huge amounts of data to chase a 1% improvement, and have been doing so for years, the shining beacon of digitilization that manufacturing should look to.","",""

Lots of data that usually just tells me that I'm overtraining, not sleeping enough, or eating/drinking too late at night.  Which brings up a topic that is front of mind for me with data/AI - the difference between using data and AI for ""eureka moments"" (e.g. don't eat after 8pm, don't do a hard ride when dehydrated or after a 95% effort day, etc) versus using data and AI for ""real-time optimizations"" (at this moment, bring your cadence up to get your HR down to conserve some for the last part of the event).

I think production is a lot like fitness.
I know how to lose weight. Stop eating cakes, and go for a run every day.

but doing that is complicated. Our inner ape takes over and we eat the cake.

I think a lot of manufacturing locations know how to be more productive. 
But there are reasons why it is difficult for the individuals and the collective to take those actions.

I think AI will become more like a coach in many instances. so for a fitness example, if your watch says, you're gone from doing no exercise in a year to going to the gyn 3 days in a row. Take a break  because your risking burnout.

If it is possible to use some generailized approach, common pattern on mapping from OPC UA to MQTT, this can be done very quickly.
With our ogamma Visual Logger for OPC you can map OPC UA variable attributes/properties such as browse path, display name, node Id to MQTT topics using Python scripts, or just using templates in simpler cases. So if your data is organized well in OPC UA servers, no way for it to take weeks or even days. Including some learning path it can be hours though I guess, not just minutes.","","👍 (1)"

- sensor data that arrive at IT systems in the data center
- and also capture logs written by these IT systems

My client already uses ServiceNow for ITSM/ITOM. ServiceNow has plugins to capture logs from disparate log systems, MidServer plugins have the ability to filter out noise and propagate useful data to ServiceNow instance, and within ServiceNow we can combine this data with data from enterprise systems and use it for ITSM, ITOM & HLA. MidServer is also used for auto-discovery within the data-centers.

The problem i have with the above approach is data is held captive within ServiceNow and is available for further exploitation with ServiceNow tools only. I cannot use less expensive/more scalable cloud tools such as AWS/Azure storage/data/AI services. In order to do this I have to perform one more hop that costs: propagate data from ServiceNow into Data Lake. The other option is land all data in the less expensive Lake (using mqtt, kafka or Data Factory on prem), cleanse/enrich it and then propagate this to ServiceNow for ITSM/ITOM. The downside is i lose MidServer plugins/auto-discovery. Does anyone have any experience with these two approaches – pros/cons, life-cycle  & costs? Thanks!","",""

Mqtt with json (no protobufs or spb compression) is generally less efficient than opc ua client/server after around 70 tags with 70 bytes per tag used for json and 26 bytes used for UA-DA. 

If you have spotty connections and need to reestablish a lot, opcua becomes less efficient (initial connection penalty bytes transmitted is big).

Other things to keep in mind are inbound port for UA, outbound only for mqtt and publish queue depth per ua item should be configured to 1 unless your ua client can consume the additional samples. If it can, and you don’t need a constant stream of quick value changes, then configure desired sample rate and use a slow publish rate.

If doing control/writes back to devices over mqtt it becomes an issue due to lack of determinism, but for non-critical I do see it used (with kepware receiving mqtt command to write and our drivers writing)

last piece if dynamic data selection - easier to make new requests for data with client/server OPC UA; with MQTT, have to RDP or call APIs or program enviro to reconfigure what's published.","","👏 (1),💯 (1)"

In this regard, additionally to deadbands, I tried to understand how RBE is used in specific use case discord members has experience, but could not get clear anwers. 
My question is: how do you handle ""report when a value is changed""? If you don't apply deadband at all, there might be cases when every new measurement can result to different value. Like 1.0000012, 1.0000032, etc. That is just noice caused by the precision / accuracy of the measurent system. So if you scan  every millisecond, you will get ""changed"" value every millisecond. If you scan every minute, you will get ""changed"" value every minute. If deadband is not applied or maybe set to too small value, you can easily get your bandwidth used too high.
If OPC UA is used, it is all clearly can be controlled by the client. But if values are published by the MQTT client, it is all controlled at this client/publisher application. 
So, the question is - if you need to change scan rate for example from 1 second to 0.5 second, how do you change it all data sources quickly? I guess this again can be done by delivering configuration settings over MQTT, which perhaps I would to it.

Often, to achieve those scheduling outcomes, there are a series of ERP modules that work together.  The modules and their underlying master data model is sufficiently detailed with the inputs and constraints the scheduling engine will need.  For example, the CRM and order management module provide demand signals or releases to a level (""buckers"") that can be broken down to plan production and shipments.  Engineering modules will have BOM and Process Routings to define the product's production process (e.g., order of operations, materials) and how it utilizes capacity (e.g., standard rate, cycle times, parallel process streams, labor utilization).  Production modules will define the resources that make up capacity (e.g., assets, processes).  Sometimes the production module will take inputs from the maintenance module to define planned downtime that isn't available for scheduling production.  Inventory modules will show what's for available for producing, shipping, etc.  MRP and Purchasing modules can help with supply chain.

At a high level, you'll probably want to begin researching ""Finite Scheduling"" solutions.  Because of complexity of inputs and constraints to model, ERPs generally do this decently because the modules are integrated.  But, it can take quite a bit of working implementing all the modules and all the associated business processes.  Also, ERPs can be rigid.  They may not work well with every production process or modality.  Some give up on formal scheduling for this reason.

I've seen some use more generalized scheduling or supply chain solutions.  This provides more flexibility, but it's hard.  The integration is really tough because most orgs do not have a clean set of inputs and constraints to pull from.  For example, production or inventory records may arrive late or is regularly revised/adjusted because of errors.  Sending ""garbage"" into the scheduling engine makes the scheduling, well, ""garbage"".","","👍 (3)"

Pros
- Is is widely used so people know what it is
- It is easy to calculate even from little data.
- It can help to highlight issues quickly and lead to quick wins.

ways to make it better
-OEE is based on the standards, and cannot be redefined by reallocating machines or calling safety meetings.
- you need to include capturing downtime, Performance and Waste issues, and here only ask the operator for what is observable, not the root cause


to @RickBullotta and @Daniel LeBlanc 's point,. 
If Rick is on Machine 1 and I am on Machine 2 and I cannot run my machine because I am waiting for stock from Machine 1. 
Then the downtime is applied to my machine, and the reason was  ""Rick didn't have his work done"". We can then put in measure to schedule in a way there there is a buffer of stock to reduce the downtime on Machine 2.

If the pieces from Machine 1 are not good enough quality and need to be rejected or reworked, then I like to reject, and apply the waste to Machine 1.

In both those cases, I now have a metric showing red and the data collected to allow me understand the root cause and fix it.

with Customers do often calculate another measure sometimes called ME 'Machine Efficiency' , or EE 'Equipment Effeciencey' and the idea here is to allow the operator see how close there were to perfect. In that case, stock not available, would not  count against performance. Or if changeover was within the plan, or where the target speed for that product is less than the machine max speed then that would not affect performance.


But I think a lot of the criticism for OEE is because people try to use it to rate operators performance and that is not a good use of OEE.

but even if it is +- 10% over a month that will probably even out. Or there is a deficiency in the measurement method so it always read low in one direction.

If I don't measure waste, to me It is like assuming no waste.

We used Vorne OEE at my first job. Not even close to being accurate (especially because quality was always 100% LOL) but still provided an immense benefit. Allowed us to deep dive into unplanned stop reasons, leading us to create a better TPM standards and ultimately a very nice PM rebuild schedule.

We were also self taught engineers (fresh EE/ME graduates with no engineering leadership) the Vorne content alone taught us so much about this industry and eventually led us to ask more questions about OEE metrics which ultimately lead us to this YouTube channel back in 2018.

We would even create diagrams, documents, forms, and trainings to teach all other maintenance and operators, based on our Vorne/4.0 industry content learnings.
In the end, the people were the greatest challenge. Many laughed at us and straight up told us they'll never take our suggestions or fill out our forms lol. 
That's when we learned it needs to come from leadership, we gave up and looked for a better career that takes industry 4.0 seriously lol

But, due to this I am still a big advocate on OEE and free online learning content. Imo, it's not necessarily about the specific KPI, protocol, tech stacks, Lean certs, or large document processes. These are all tools, and there can be value added from any of them depending on the environment and how you apply them.

Unless it is a huge crash with collatoral damage, or things like overnight(ing) fees need to be paid.

To me Value stream mapping is really valuable and ensure that you can understand and communicate the process to others, i.e. integrators etc.

It can be really really valuable in a a DT, or even MES implementation, but because most companies don't use them it can become very difficult to justify the time and cost, if they are not already created.

They are a bit like Functional Logic Drawings, or well maintained panel drawings.

But if you have a set of value stream maps I would say it can give you about a 1.3x acceleration in Time.

What it will really save is all the small changes that need to be made during UAT, where it turns out the communication of the process to the integrator was not up to scratch.","",""

the value is that if you hire me to automate you process, be that a production or business process, I need to first understand it.

that can be very difficult, and a Value Stream map really helps with that.

1- It is still important to understand the flow of materials, especialy if you are looking at traceability. Think tracking product batches in a dairy, how do you know where the cream and skim milk goes?

In my experience , often as you get to the testing stage of a project,  there are lots of tweeks, sometimes bugs sometimes variations, then arise because the real-world-process was not fully understood. Again, I find that it tends to happen in the non-core processes because there is more time spend in understanding the core process.

I have never put OEE or Power on a VSM. They are related as they are parts of the system.

The answer to your question is many-fold.  But there are two points that jump out at me that we should highlight.

1. You are definitely approaching the question from the perspective that ALL legacy orgs will find the answer.  This is a fundamental mistake most in our industry make (OEMs, End-Users, SIs et al).  The fact is, during transformative times, only a fraction survive without bankruptcy and/or M&A.  The number, based on a longitudinal analysis of Industry 2 and Industry 3, is 1 in 12.  1 in 12 are your audience and will find the answer.  One of the major reasons we see so much 'noise', buzz-words, fuzzy definitions is because OEMs are trying to sell to 12 in 12.  They are taking guidance from all customers -- even those who have no idea what DX actually is.  This is where you see people attribute terms to outcomes that are unrelated (calling a proprietary, deterministic integration 'open' or calling the digitization of a report 'digital transformation')

Become digitally fluent so you can't be confused by the noise and then focus on the 1 in 12 (they are the examples for the 11 in 12 to follow)

2. A principle I don't talk about often but is very important is The Shirky Principle.  Groups try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.  It is in OEMs best interest to muddy the waters, confuse, hijack, misappropriate, obfuscate what DX and I4 are,  to preserve what they have in the market.  Legacy OEMs are most guilty but there are plenty of start-ups who do the same.  OEMs are actively trying to preserve the problem (barrier to entry for conversion of digital data into information in service automating business decisions while plugging into a digital supply chain) because they make money off of being the solution.

Focus on the relationship between digital strategy, open and edge driven architectures and transformative leadership -- and ignore the noise.","",""

I think we need to be careful around the communication of I4.0 and the increase in transparency, like all things DT, culture transformation is very important. If we start implying people are acting malicious, that is a quick way to lose support and actually provoke people to act out against the digital transformation efforts. 

Most managers are not malicious, they just don't have the access to data, Because of this, they have had to make assumptions or simplifications for their calculations, at scale when every mfg area manager does this, it reduces confidence in the KPIs and they can't be used for comparison. Obviously we get more standardization and confidence in the data when the KPIs are automated. The automation often makes managers nervous because KPIs they were once responsible for change overnight and tell a different story.

 If we want to win over the work force, we need to be sensitive in how we communicate the increased transparency, it should be forward facing and not a blame game.","","💯 (6)"

Most people are tyring to help solve problems, that included the Big consultants, the Big vendors, the small start ups.
And one observations I always like to remember is that people will avoid looking too critically at things, if that will disrupt, how they put a roof over their family, feed their kids send their kids to college, have a nice car.......

and if an extra bonus allows me do something special for my wife, then I will look to maximise the areas that my bonus depends on.

Compound that with human beings 
    tendency to repeat what has worked before,
    tendency to be proud of why that have built from their efforts.
    tendency to defend when they are being attacked. It is hard to Trusting your self when all men doubt you is actual easy, making allowance for their doubting too is much much  harder.

I think I understand why people might be resistant to change, especially if they feel they are doing well( i.e. their speed is still high and they have not noticed they have stopped accelerating)

I think those here who lead DX and help advise those who lead DX have a duty to learn how to convince those who are sceptical and not just get rid of them. For all I hear about resistance to change and people not looking forwards, I have never come across someone who doesn't get on board when some slows down and explain to them and addresses their concerns.","","💯 (2),👍 (2)"

We completed projects at the site level with no involvement from corporate. We simply had to report our results up through our management. So we used the corporate push to get buy-in from the shop floor. I left this job but one of my colleagues still works there on a digital transformation team. He reports up through IT, travels to the sites, and owns the applications. Most sites don't have in-house Automation resources so sometimes he's training contractors when he travels to the sites.

Alternatively, my current company recently started a digital transformation team with an IT Sponsor, Corporate Sponsor, Project Manager, etc. We've spent 4 hours trying to determine what the goals of the team should be. Right now, I'm fighting them because they want to standardize our PLC hardware across sites.

I find that perhaps approaching IT with ""We want to Digitally transform, but we really need your help in understanding the modern ways to approach this""
I have found the best way to get buy in is, ask for help, because that person has insight and skills you need, and tell them so. 

And it sounds like you have that hurdle started, the other advice I would give, is smaller and faster project phases.
I say this alot but If you do 1 machine first, using Node red and Grafana, you will in a few weeks have something working but also have learned so many of the integration problem you will face. Even if you discard all the code and move with another platform it is worth it.

Mario Ishikawa
I'd say it will depend of the size, but there is always a need to have a champion driving it. However, in several cases the champion won't have the political capital, so this champion should not be the one trying to convince the board. Instead, the vision should come from the board, from the CEO, and this champion should be then chosen and empowered. A lot of departments need to work together in harmony despite of divergent goals they already might have. I like the book Digital Transformation, by Thomas Siebel, who address this. In short, small companies can have this being driven by the CEO or someone designated by her/him for it. For larger companies, for a unified and receivable plan by all plants and departments there should be someone from C-level fully involved on this.

The first advantage you get, regardless of which system you choose is improved visibility and transparency. And then, if the system is good enough and you can connect it to ERP, MES, CMMS, Shift Monitoring Systems, etc the results will blow your mind... you get increased participation in scheduling from experienced people from your organisation who otherwise would have stayed aside minding their job (as per job description).

It is a bit like are Vertically or horizontally integrated company the best approach.

in Sports, it defiantly makes sense to have teams made up of all diverse skill sets that are correct for the position.

but in organisation with no set limit on the number of members it becomes a different question.

There is a famous story my father used to tell, of when an outsider became CEO in a insurance company, and looked at the Actuarial group and thought, why are the smartest people in the company all in the one group and one room, and split them up and put them into different teams.

the Actuaries hated it and could not function well at all.

in your last picture, you can certainly take that approach, but you need to forma Pseudo-team of the app developers so they can share issues and solutions as well.

Maersk did that well, I was part of the Automation Team, but had weekly Meetings with the OT architect group, and a bi weekly with the entire Architecture group


and that I think is the correct approach for DT.
you should have a lot of different sprints, some developing new functionality, some expanding existing functionality to new lines, some starting on new plants.

and in that case the sprint team, needs to have the skill sets it needs. and if I am a python coder on that team I want to be reporting to the person I deliver to, the sprint lead.

But I need to be in a group of DT/OT Python Coders, and a larger group of all the Coders in the org perhaps.","",""

To cover the gaps an assessor with implementation experience should conduct to reap the benefits of SIRI. The prioritization matrix leaves you half way you need to build MTR, roadmap items, and use-cases based on your experience. 

I did 40+ assessments to SMEs, and multi-billion multi-nationals and argue that with a consultancy hat including DTMA questions, you can become a rainmaker for most manufacturers. If I were to re-write SIRI methodology I would include all Organization dimensions as prioritized dimensions because it is the dominant factor for a successful transformation

It should not be one or the other, I think the backbone questions should be from DTMA and details of the 10 pillars should be included in SIRI dimensions but the prioritization should be based on costs structure, company KPIs, benchmark to peers. The roadmap should include use cases for pilot, long-term as well as the UNS architecture with MTR details for the company. 

All of those should start with organizational pillars: Strategy, Workforce learning & development, leadership competency and inter- intra- collaboration dimensions. All successful companies I have seen had these in place","","💯 (2)"

With more and more professional sports entering into contracts with streaming services there is a lot more data available on viewer demographics. This allows streaming companies to tailor their advertising to appeal more to that specific audience and also push to acquire or create similar content. It's no surprise that Amazon was one of the first to lean heavily into streaming live sports. They paid $11 Billion for Thursday night football and it's basically a loss leader just to get customers using their service and of course to get their data (which Amazon can use 100 different ways I'm sure).

1- Set your Strategy
2- Inventory the business
3- Set Minimum Technological requirements, (and a model Architecture)
4 -Decide and execute a Proof of Concept and in doing so 
    Connect, Collect, Store, Visualise, Analyse, Spot Patterns , Report and Solve those problems
  then keep repeating

It is sometimes a good real world approach, to put the Paper on Glass, and then say, oout of theses 20 pieces of information how many can I collect easily, it might be 17.

Digitalization: This is the use of digital technologies and digitized data to impact how work gets done, transform how customers and companies engage and interact. It's about the use of digital information to simplify and enhance processes. Digitalization implies a change in operations and can lead to improvements in efficiency and effectiveness. It often involves automation of routine tasks and the integration of digital technology into existing business processes.

**1. Automation and Control Systems:**
**Discrete Automation: **Relies on stand-alone, discrete automation systems rather than integrated, flexible, and adaptive systems.
**Limited PLC/SCADA Use: **Uses Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems primarily for basic control and monitoring, without advanced data analytics or connectivity.
Manual Processes: Many processes are still manually operated or manually initiated, with limited automation.

2. Data and Connectivity:
**Isolated Systems:** Machines and systems are isolated with minimal or no connectivity, leading to data silos.
**Limited Data Utilization: **Data is collected manually or not collected at all, with little use of real-time data for decision-making.
Lack of IIoT Devices: Few or no Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices are deployed to gather and transmit data from machines and processes.

3. Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES):
**Basic MES or None: **Either no MES in place or a very basic MES that does not integrate with other systems for holistic production management.
**Manual Reporting:** Production and maintenance reports are generated manually, often with spreadsheets or paper records.

4. IT and OT Integration:
**Separated IT and OT:** Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems operate independently with little or no integration.
**Lack of Unified Namespace:** No unified namespace for comprehensive and coherent data representation across the facility.

5. Maintenance Strategies:
**Reactive Maintenance: **Maintenance is predominantly reactive rather than predictive or proactive, leading to higher downtime and inefficiencies.
**Minimal Predictive Analytics:** Little to no use of predictive maintenance tools or analytics to foresee and mitigate potential equipment failures.

6. Operational Flexibility:
**Rigid Production Lines:** Production lines are rigid and inflexible, designed for mass production of limited product types with long changeover times.
**Limited Customization:** Inability to easily customize or personalize products to meet specific customer demands.

7. Workforce Skills:
**Traditional Skillsets:** Workforce is primarily skilled in traditional manufacturing and maintenance techniques, with limited training in digital technologies and data analytics.
**Resistance to Change:** Potential resistance to adopting new technologies and processes due to lack of understanding or fear of disruption.

8. Customer and Supply Chain Integration:
**Limited Customer Interaction: **Minimal integration with customers for real-time order tracking, customization, and feedback.
Disconnected Supply Chain: Supply chain operations are not synchronized in real-time, leading to inefficiencies and delays.","","🤝 (1)"

Some solution providers will market that they have SAP integrations, but trivialize or omit the details of what it takes to make that actually work.

SAP is not another OT node that produces/consumes telemetry data.  It's not integrated the same way Ignition, Canary, MING, etc are.  It's not simply a matter finding the right interface adapter.  There is an impedance mismatch between it and OT nodes.  ""SAP"" is an IT endpoint that will have specific requirements that are a function of how it was implemented.

Think less about the interface and think more about the use case.  A successful integration will be oriented around the what purpose, what message, what logic, what SAP module, etc.  Once those things are identified, determining the interface is more straightforward.","","👍 (1)"

An integration can definitely be reused or scaled. I’m referring to using use cases as a methodology to define an outcome and work back through the technology. Industrial controls professionals sometimes assume that ERP systems are another thing that produces and consumes tags. They’re a completely different beast.

SAP is not a SCADA system. It does not just replicate a collection of telemetry data points. It will have specific transactions for specific purposes. These transactions will have specific payloads and specific logic.

By choosing an outcome like line change overs, processing inventory, inspection records, etc, it allows one to better focus and understand the transactions involved. By learning this, one can build integrations that can be generalized and can be scaled.","","👍 (2)"

But the short version that i intended to write and didn't is that the tools and technologies will change. So start by identifying the needs and the culture. and move from there.

This includes the operators, the management, the IT team, engineering, maintenance, admin staff... anyone and everyone in the organization. Implementing the tools and technologies will often require a level of technical aptitude so it is often about finding the right people who can help.

Sensors, PLCs, Robots, Ignition, MQTT, HighByte, Node Red, SQL - these are all tools that can be used to solve problems but are useless if the problems have not been identified.

So tips I would give based on experience, And theses are based on Issues I have run into , so they may not be relevant for you at all.

how many machines have you in total? I would put in an ""Area"" Level, if there are a lot of machines. 
Personally even if there are only a few machines I put in a ""Production"" area

is BMS the organisation name, or the Building Management system.?
if it is the Building Management System, and you have a PLC at the Machine for that, I would put structure as 
- Enterprise->Production->Machine 14118-> BMS

Personally I don't like putting the PLC in, because if I have sensor on Machine 1, it might be wired to Machine 2 or to an area level PLC. I have seen this a lot with things added in after the machine is installed like labellers or barcode sensors. That said I often have an Topic called/ Ent/Plant/Area/PLC/Raw data. and map all the signals from the PLC to that point , and then parse and publish them to the UNS part of my Broker

Are the CMMS and ERP and Work order system, Enterprise level? If they are plant level I would put them in below the Plant.
( that is why I like at least one Area) I do classify big Systems for the Plant as an Area","","👍 (4)"

[10:29 AM] Walker Reynolds
The role is CDO (Chief Digital Officer).  Orgs can be successful two ways.  

1. CIO and CDO are one role that, in conjunction, leads the creation and execution of the Digital Strategy by driving IT as a service organization tasked with enabling Digital Transformation

2. CDO and CIO are separate roles where CDO is responsible for operations and infrastructure around DT, and CIO is responsible for converting the data into value for the organization — including making data a commodity for sale.

Operational execution is achieved through the org, led by a DT team until the org reaches digital maturity, upon which time DT is part of the culture.

can somebody help me understand something here since my lack of experience in the field and on UNS but i am learning. lets say you have a company with 3-5 plants that you want to digital transform and you want to have technology driven solutions so you want to build an uns architecture but you also need an MES bc of etc... now you can maybe start with MING stack or maybe use Ignition as IIOT platform and then expand with time adding highbyte or hivemq etc.. you get the idea:)
So lets say you are the driver, the manager that is driving this and you probably have all these big players like rockwell, siemens etc selling you their solutions that probably are expensive and locking you to their ecosystem but you want to build an open, edge driven, technology based architecture.
- Do you need a team of maybe 2-4 plp that will build and maintain and drive the above instead of paying consultancy firm proposing you off the shelf solution or high cost engeering one?
-  Are you building your own MES solution with this iiot platform or you buy a solution and connect to the eco system? in this case you want to have enterprize MES so maybe building is too costly but also you need to maintain it?
- what is more preferred storing all your data on-prem or using cloud to store all your data?
- do you employ an integrator to guide you and help you during this journey as you cant drive it alone and how to avoid these one that are selling you expensive off the shelf soltions?
- how do you enable worker of the future like Walker said. do you give access to UNS to different users in you company and let them develop solutions which you can integrate into the eco system?
- what is the timeline until you have architecture in place, structured data coming in and you can start solving your business problems, maybe even using AI and ML?
- how do you avoid setting up costly strategy and avoid being stuck with solutions/softwares that don not allow you to scale and be agile.","",""

1. A smallish team may be able to maintain what's put in place but you need a much bigger team to start with (at least for 3-5 plants) if you want to get anywhere quickly. Here's where a good I4.0 integrator can help by giving you horsepower to start and help you avoid some technical debt.
2. You certainly could roll your own MES from scratch but then you need an even bigger team. Better to start with a platform like Ignition, FactoryStudio, or Tulip, and build on top of it.
3. Only your organization can answer that question. One answer could be ""both"". My company is ""Cloud First"" and we're a Tulip house.
4. Better if you do... We didn't and it's taken us about 5 years to really get embedded in out plants. Very slow growth at first but now starting to accellerate. 
5. Most people should have at least `Read only` access to the UNS. You may be required to restrict access to sensative data though.
6. With a good integrator you're probably at least 2 years before you see AI/ML solutions but that can vary a lot by industry/maturity.

Don't use consultants. Use Integrators who have built something similar to what you want and make sure they are problem orientated.

( I consult but I am not a consultant)

Do the up front work first.
Strategy. Inventory the business. Model architecture. MTR.

Define a proof of concept. Solve it.
Solve more problems on the same machine. Roll out to more machines.
Roll out to more plants.

In relation to platform cost. I like to start cheap or free and add more expensive nodes as I scale. Start with MING if needed. Or Ignition/Framework.
You can probably solve 18 months of problems without encouraging too much technical debt, and then move to more expensive ones.

I default to on prem( especially for storage) and then move data  to cloud when it is needed there to solve a problem that has been identified.

I would employ an integrator.
Or there are quite a few small Integrators here who consult. But if you have a preferred integrator you want to build, I would bring in a consulting system architect to help get started ( the can also help with the pre-work).

The worker should have tools with access to the data in the UNS. What that looks like is very specific to you company.

Architecture in place 4 to 6 months. But it keeps growing.
AI and ML. 18 to 24 months minimum

Make sure your MTR and model architecture allow any component to be replaced with minimum impact to other nodes.","","🔥 (2),💯 (1)"

So finance solution is to look for an add on software that will push updates into the ERP for customer pricing. They tasked a brand new part time IT solution person with finding this software. Back of my head is screaming this is about the dumbest approach I've heard of. Pushing information like this into the ERP. I'd like to see what you guys think. Have you heard of this approach? Pros/Cons? Company I work for keeps taking these piece meal approaches thinking finding software will fix their problems.","",""

Mostly because as Walker has mentioned, different partnership models make all the difference. Large SI organizations often focus solely on providing an engineering service—they develop a solution, assist with deployment, and that's it. Rarely do they care about training or helping the contracted organization become self-sufficient.

But on average I find smaller SIs are  more flexible, open to ideas, and truly become partners through knowledge sharing. We've put large SIs on contract, specifying training and knowledge sharing in the SOW, but they consistently underperform in that department imho.

I see re-skilling as a major issue over the next 5-10 years (already is in a lot of ways). Especially for a large enterprise who need to retain some expertise.","","👍 (4),💯 (2)"

Spain and Italy are good too. And UNS is developing more on those areas too.

In France we do too have some UNS implementation, but hard to convince, because
- execs always have bigger problems 
- and wants to know ROI, 
- and FR companies are against any change... 
- And are either ignorant or arrogant, wanting to change themselves without experience and no success for the last 3 years.. 

Results : many factories FR are closing and energy cost does not help. 
Brand new ones 🔥 are closing too for either not being competitive, or don't know how to manage a (modern) factory created thanks to grants (my taxes!), or for being ripped out by licensing cost of software that don't help the shopfloor.

The European Investment Bank is stating that only 11% of EU factories are fully digitalized. So a large progress is achievable across EU !

That means they're not making use of the data they already generate.  I'm in Germany, BTW.

@Vincent Thavonekham, FactoVia wrote about France, but what he describes is certainly not unique to France - I've seen the same here.  It's also not limited to small companies either.  If you're an external integrator, it's really difficult to get any traction as long as they think they know what they're doing.

It looks like those that are pragmatic and willing to listen will transform and thrive - helped by the fact that their competitors don't.  It really is a repeat of I3.0, and the main reason is that people are still people and behave much the same.  The wrong managers are in charge.  While you and I can't change that, financial reality will hit them sooner or later and we will see changes in the landscape.

True story: a mid-sized German company set up a new ""smart factory"" abroad, over the last year or two - where work orders are being printed out on paper and typed in, and there's still heavy reliance on manual assembly (ie: it's not very automated at all).  I can't tell whether it's stupidity or whether they're lying to themselves, but it's certainly not smart.  I estimate their DTMA score to be under 40 too.

There's a huge variety in the digital maturity of companies. From purely paper-based production to companies with their own software development teams, creating custom (and often quite impressive) solutions for their problems on the shop floor and beyond.

When presenting our (Siemens) portfolio, sometimes you get blank stares, and sometimes it's the best thing since sliced bread, like when the customer was already looking for a platform to run their Docker containers on in production. Who you talk to makes a huge difference, sometimes you can convince a higher-up, sometimes there's a capable person in the OT with a problem they need solving. It's almost never IT, and OT and IT are often openly at war with each other. But small, young ""digital competence"" teams or spin-offs of larger companies can be very open and useful.

One major shift is how very different this is to the I3.0 business model of ""selling grey boxes"" that many of my older colleagues are used to. You can sell someone another PLC or I/O card, they know what it's for. You cannot just sell someone an edge device, it doesn't mean anything. The vast majority of the time, there is no clear digital strategy, everything is ad-hoc and the entire topic is extremely consulting- and support-heavy.

The bigger manufacturing players usually do have their shit together in terms of IT infrastructure and understand what we can offer, but there it often just takes forever, months or years, to get anywhere. E.g. someone at some point set a standard for how Kubernetes deployments are to be done and nothing can be changed about that...

The company in my story is.  To be fair, it's attitude not age that makes the difference.  Elon has worked (and slept!) on the factory floor.  I'm pretty sure none of the top 2 levels of management in my story's company has done either - certainly not in the last decade.

FPS ( fucking paper solution). And in mid-size companies, everything is about cost savings. If your solution can cut people (whole person), then you might have a chance. if you just save some time but no hard saving is doable in a few months, then it is a very hard sell, and only progressive-thinking companies will adopt it. So if you can save a person 1 hour a day, but they still have to pay the salary, then it's going to be very hard to sell something because this is not cost-cutting but cost addition.

but in most cases, you will have an overtime bill, where you can save. so assuming 10 and hour, and time an a half for over time, the wage bill to produce the same goes from 95 to 80. that is a 15% saving on wages. plus the reduction in electricity because you can turn off the lights.","","👍 (2)"

Driving the business off a cliff and ending up closing because you failed the digital initiative—now that's also a change and should raise fear in executives on a much more primal level, like the cold, sweaty, sleepless-night type of shit, seriously.

The very first step that we have all learned on this community we need to take for digital transformation apart from the education is to collect data. nobody argues i want to believe about that. We all or the majority here that have visit even couple of factories know that legacy systems or even systems like 5 or 10 years before which by the way for manufacturing are considered brand new, are all over the place and we are calling to collect data from those systems. from my experience there are two ways forward. One, we say the customer that you need to contact the machine oem and tell him that we want to extract all data in an opc ua or what ever we choose. second way forward, no worries we will go into the plc ourselves and we will extract the data. Now apparently the first way is the preferable one since we are talking that any organisation call us in, is mature and most likely serious enough with their data that's why he call us in first place. From my experience in the filed is that once the customer call the oem the exact that moment we lost the ball to keep the proof of concept or what ever project we have undertake on track. Suddenly the ball is on how busy the oem is, how quickly he can do the job and so on so forth. if we choose the second way forward then we put the customer instead of a piece of mind state, shifts to an anxious state, having thoughts like can they really do it, what if they do something and then I have problems on the machine and the list of thoughts goes on.

1) Low awareness > CEOs see digital transformation as too risk (difficult, expensive and a mess) so:
- Some ignore the issue, lacking vision and unaware of the consequences
- Some make superficial changes, but fail to address the elephant in the room

2) Trust > Helping them is difficult, because:
- Some find hard to recognize they need help
- If they seek for help, they do not know who to trust

3) 2 ways to solve the problem that neither works
- Consultant: listened by the CEO, but short on delivering actionable solutions
- Architect: the opposite

4) Main driver to get buy-in: demonstrate MEANINGFUL cost savings. It is all about cost reduction

Note: Transversal issue to all manufacturers. No matter size or region

Some observations (purely from my experience):
- I agree, although surprised to see no differences between companies in different regions and sizes (ie. many Swiss companies are family companies, in which management is more long term focused vs public companies)
- Little can be done about Low awareness. The majority of companies will see the consequences when it is too late
- A viable solution would be a person with both consulting and tech skills. If it is a firm it should be small. The incentives of a consulting firm and its clients become more misaligned as the former grows
- Obtain meaningful cost savings in a short period of time is very difficult","","👍 (2)"

- depending on your machine, reviewing the oems communication interfsces will likely lead you to a lot of material with code / commands etc. to extract data
- if not, yes contact the oem....
- tapping into an existing plc is also a good option, so long as you separate code you add to capture data from main functions....however, if youre concerned your data extraction could hinder machine performance, reevaluate how you ate interfacjng with the machine...communication should not impede performance

From both a commercial and project progression standpoint, relying solely on each OEM to handle tasks independently isn’t advisable—in my experience, this approach can lead to complications and unsecure delivery times from system integrator. This results to unsecure revenue streams and everytihing associated with. 

Attempting to make adjustments ourselves within their PLCs, no matter the level of expertise, simply isn’t feasible. Major clients like Coca-Cola, Kellogg's or Nestle are unlikely to permit direct access to any of their machines in the plant from a small system integrator. Unless you have a different experience but from 25years of building sites all around the globe, each one time we have tried to go as such, customer was uncomfortable. And I mean with customers we have built them the entire factory and they trust us 100%.

I come from a very large enterprise organization where everyone had their silo they were expected to work in. I rose quickly in the organization because I was able to cross those silos, and was eager to learn about related areas of the business. (It's also important to note I had a supervisor who encouraged that). 

Eventually, though, almost my whole team ended up moving on to new organizations because people felt like, despite being a highly digitally-literate manufacturer, they didn't have the control of their destiny like they wanted. Projects and deadlines would, seemingly arbritrarily, come down from on high. Politics would pit managers (and their teams) against one another to where a team would complete a project just to see it dismantled by another team. It was organized, but almost to a weaponized degree. I really liked the organization for the most part, but that was the most demoralizing.

I ended up moving on as well and am at a manufacturer in the same industry, but at the _very beginning_ of their journey. Most everything was paper or, potentially an excel spreadsheet. They were pretty good at it, but hitting the limit of what they could make work.

As a one-man show, I've helped (and been enabled by management) completely replace the network infrastructure across our plants, replace legacy accounting system with a cloud-based solution allowing for remote work, implemented a temporary off-the-shelf ERP to build a culture of digital literacy in the org and greatly speed up the ability for the business to see the flow of material into and out of the plant. And now we're onto making use of data that's 'locked' behind the InTouch/Wonderware/PLCs of our equipment.

Culture does, indeed, a lot to do with the agency I have in the organization.","","❤️ (1)"

So I work in a quality lab checking incoming an outgoing parts with manual and computer aided measuring equipment at a local automotive supplier. Their digital transformation is rather slow. Outside of my job duties in my spare time I do c# coding. To make my life easier at work I started to develop a software at home which collects and shows data from the machines in a way that exactly matches my preferred workflow and is not readily available by third party or the device manufacturers. Over the months I spend quite a lot of time on coding and more and more featurers got added. Now several people from department lead to plant manager saw what is possible and want to use it as well all over the plant. I feel a little bit of dilemma. On one hand it feels nice to get recognized for the work I did and I am happy to help coworkers and the company. On the other hand I feel like it would be nice to get somehow compensated for the time I used in my spare time before handing over software and source files also knowing additional mandatory work will be added in future because other people are involved. Is it expected by a company that in a case like this all I do and create for work is automatically owned by them because I am an employee and should always act in best interest for company with or without money involved ?

One doesn't care about data, they already sold the machine - or they can sell it to another party that doesn't care... Aka, too bad, no data, go.into the PLC and find the tags ourselves.

The other loves data, they especially love your data, and are happy to charge you a few to access their web portal that allows you to see your data. Need that data locally, too bad, it's a proprietary protocol they built... But at least they have a $10,000 gateway they will sell you, but only if their techs come out for a week to install and configure it. Basically, this type becomes, pay the fee and get the gateway, pay the fee and scrape their website, or sit there for a month with Wireshark and figure it out. 

Sometimes, not often but sometimes, we run into a third that is excited about data but has never been asked to do It before or didn't know they could... These guys will work with us and help identify what is needed to best access the data.

Most of the ones on the PLC side don't necessarily lock it down, they just have heavily standardized and messy code that often has entire sections abandoned or unused... it makes reverse engineering it a challenge - Not too hard but rarely in the budget of the end user... 

If the data is clean, structured, and meaningfully addressed / named - than it shouldn't be hard for the end user to pick up with any SCADA, IIoT Platform, or gateway appliance. It is sad that it is viewed as an add on and not a minimum requirement... Most places I got I try and convince the client to write it in their spec but they rarely do... often times they feel like it would prevent them from getting the most effective machine.

of course it is it dive improvements, make decisions faster, become a data drive company.

I want to lose some weight so I look better while dating
I want to be stronger so I pick up my kids for longer,   
I want to reduce injuries, so I'll be able to pick up my grand kids.

So when setting a digital Strategy, is it to lower the cost of production, is it to manage to keep up with Quality requirements,  is it to allow you to scale.  but like our reasons for keeping fit change, so too do our reasons for Digital Transformation, and so too should our strategy.

Architecture should be focused on requirements/use cases and remain generic AS LONG AS YOU CAN. At some point in the design cycle you will need to make down selections on design patterns, frameworks, libraries, etc. But at soon as you do, you start to impose constraints on the design that may make compromises. Starting at the requirements/use cases ensures you define what is important so that when you do make those compromises you know where your priorites are, and what things are appropriate to compromise on. If you don't start there, you will find the architecture might start make compromises in areas that are not appropriate. 

Architecture is always about pro/cons, and a good architect knows how to identify priorities, and chose design patterns in such a way that the final design meets/excels in the areas that are important for the user, and makes compromises in areas that aren't mission critical.","","👍 (2),🔥 (3)"

Some will elect to replicate everything and others will elect to replicate what’s needed for downstream data products supporting enterprise-level use cases. Infrequently capturing the changes of metadata and frequently capturing the value changes. With buffering and snowpipe streaming, ingestion is pretty efficient. The real cost with something like Snowflake is the compute on query-side. There is quite a bit of optimization that can be done using dynamic tables and views.

At the end of the day, it’s not going to be used for something like PI Vision where a process engineer is going to trend an instrumentation value to monitor and control the process. It’s used for more analytical and exploratory purposes. The downstream data products are often blended with other data (e.g., weather, customer demand, supplier data).","","👍 (3)"

But realistically if you build a MES on a platform like Ignition, or you buy and configure GE Proficy for example there is still a lot of customisation needed and the man-hours needed is not massively different.

And it very much depends on what you mean by a MES , what functions are you looking to get, and how quickly.

There are ""Buy"" solutions I would certainly use and configure to my needs, and ""Build"" solution I would not touch with a barge pole

1 define your strategy 
2 Inventory your business and tech
3 define you Minimum Technical requirements
4 Define your Model Architecture.
