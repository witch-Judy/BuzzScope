1. Production data, raw material consumption
2. Jobs/production orders programmed
3. Customization. ERP was customized, OT was custom, but they were never planned together and the result is a customization of this integration that could be one step ahead in complexity, example: ERP needs a information in a way that is not on OT because is not used and then it has to be processed/calculated on the PLC with a complex set of blocks, but wait, the PLC cannot send a POST to a REST API, then a gateway is added and so on.","","üôå (1),üëç (1)"

@Walker Reynolds 

Interesting question, answering from my view point so far,

1. What data exists on the plant floor that most organizations would benefit from having it available for the ERP?

    a. Consumption and Production (101/261 on SAP terms)
    b. Material reservation and issue
    c. FG Warehousing 
    d. Dispatch details (every product) for the delivery order created in ERP
    e. Machine breakdown intimation to create tickets to fix
    f. scrap or rework data
    g. utilities monitoring (energy/steam etc.,) per product
    h. Tool usage data like a bladder or moulds
    i. Quality data, PDI etc.,
    j. Machine availability in case of an ERP integrated scheduler


2. What data exists in the ERP that most organizations would benefit from having it available on the plant floor?

    a. Material Reservation per shift basis
    b. Production Orders, linked to a scheduler
    c. Maintenance orders created to sort out a breakdown at the machine
    d. Dispatch or Delivery orders to be executed based on priority

3. What is the biggest challenge in connecting or merging OT (the plant floor) with IT (business systems like ERP) data?
    
    a. Data contextualization which deals with lots of customization","","üëç (3)"

@John Sullivan 

My preference is two-tier:  Plex + Workday.

Plex is a manufacturing-centric ERP with modules for MES, quality, supply chain, accounting, purchasing, maintenance, etc.  It's quality management and inventory functionality are exceptional.  It's like an ERP where the shop floor functionality was built out first and then finance / HR last.  Usually it's the other way around.  It's weak on HR.  In terms of financials, most corporate finance departments might be used to something more polished.  It has enterprise capabilities like financial consolidation, centralized treasury, multi-entity, international etc.  But, not like the way the traditional finance-centric ERPs would.  But, in terms of plant-level financials, corporate finance types might be pleasantly surprised.  The accounting and purchasing modules are deeply integrated into manufacturing modules.  The manufacturing activities drive financial transactions.  A/P, A/R, and costing are a breeze.  In the end, good accounting software is only as good as the data its fed.","","üëç (2)"

It was built by the founders of PeopleSoft after the hostile takeover by Oracle.  In recent years it's expanded into Financials and other more traditional ERP functionality.  It's one of the few big ERPs that is technologically modern (i.e., not software recycled from the 20th century).  It's cloud-native, it uses an object-store rather than conventional relational database, and it has a real integration layer.  Workday has very capable financials functionality and reporting.  Big multinationals use it.  Some use just the HCM and use other solutions for financials like HCM.  The strength is its platform.  It's process-oriented and it's built for integration.

TL;DR:  Workday at HQ.  Plex at the plants.  Workday handles corporate-level financial consolidation and planning.  Workday handles all HR.  Plex handles everything else","",""

Their whole ecosystem is, well, let's say complicated.  They're perfectly capable and are available in every corner of the world.  I wouldn't necessarily endorse them for running your whole business end-to-end.

Outside of supply chain, I'm not really a fan of Oracle.  Netsuite, an Oracle acquisition, is good solution for vanilla ERP workloads (e.g., finance, hr).  I wouldn't say that the manufacturing functionality is exceptionally strong.  They have a similarly complicated legacy as SAP, but also with a very certain way of doing business.

However I have problems imagining the transition to a UNS through the whole stack. I see multiple solutions how to get machine data in a UNS. What I do not get is getting the ERP hooked up to the UNS - and I mean I don't even know where my starting point would be as I am not a SAP expert by any means. At the moment SAP is kind of our data-hub for everything and our whole production is deeply integrated with SAP. The problem is: It takes far to long to built applications based on SAP-data, because for every SAP-table that might be necessary for a new application we need a SAP function, that can be called via RFC. How would that change with SAP connected to a UNS, wouldn't it still be necessary to have something like a ton of custom RFCs to even bring the interesting stuff from SAP to UNS?

Also ERP is mostly managed on the corporate level and they not always see direct value for them doing or allowing integration. Short term benefits are for the plants.. of course everyone wins on the longer term if plants perform better. Another thing I see is problems with the ERP implementation itself not always being a good fit for each business / plant (piloted one a specific business and not taking into account all others) resulting in different levels of adoption causing inconsistency. Just sharing my experience and insight so might not be a general thing. Also don‚Äôt want to sound negative about anyone or anything, things are not as bad as they might sound.","","üëç (1)"

But we are often used to bridge the OT/IT domain and make OT data easily usable by traditional IT systems and tools.  The scope of ERP varies as some, SAP, Oracle and PLEX, combine MES functionality with ERP.  At the end of the day we can either push data into or pull data out of ERP via SQL, REST or even MQTT (for PLEX) connections.  An example for the integration is to combine asset master or material master data stored the ERP system with MES or real time data when you put it in the Unified Namespace or in the cloud data lake.  When it comes to the Unified Namespace and ISA 95, there are a number of data feeds between the MES and ERP defined in ISA 95 which can be enabled through the UNS.","","üëç (2)"

One of the (many) early lessons of this ERP disaster: draw clear and hard lines of control and process ownership between modules and systems, and make sure those lines map to what is done on the shop floor. In this bad example, SAP ERP with WM integrated to a WMS+ASRS and a MES: all systems have container level inventory with multiple level storage units and transport carriers, all systems to a degree can change and move inventory around and all systems are available on the factory floor in different forms (mobiles, desktops etc). The intended design defined which steps to be done in which systems and sequence following logical flow from receipt through sampling, put away, picking to staging and production but quickly due to frustration and system errors then operators navigated to instead using the most convenient and accessible tool not necessarily the intended one. The number of unexpected transactions quickly snowballed into several 100‚Äôs of failed interface messages for inventory movement alone daily, each error resulting in an item that could not be used at all, or was in the wrong state for the physical activity giving at best strange behaviour or at worst a total hard stop to operations. The triage team multiplied accordingly until all 3 system vendors and internal client departments had people struggling to keep up with 1000‚Äôs of support tickets building up after just a few days post go-live. So, as an input to method from this failure: then start with as-is process flow, walk the shop floor and talk to people to understand the business processes and their constraints then identify what exactly they need, and what they don‚Äôt and how to make it as easy as possible for them by ensuring the footprint of systems do not overlap. Do this a long time before you start running integration workshops with IF experts!","","üòç (1),üëç (1)"

In terms of database and API connectivity, that's generally not a problem.  Direct vendor lock-in is not really a problem as the cost of switching is enough of a deterrent.  In terms of changing source code or functionality, it's complicated.  There is much more breadth and depth of functionality.  There is somewhat of a tradeoff, at least in the long-run, between openness and resiliency.  Ignition and FS are platforms where those deploying largely build their own business processes and functionality.  The ERP world is different in that functionality deployed typically will be both built and tailored.  That is, sometimes the business processes will be designed around the ERP and sometimes it's the business process ""designing"" the ERP.  This will govern how ""open"" the platform is perceived.

Personally, I like multi-tenant SaaS platforms for ERP.  I believe that there is more innovation in platforms where all deployments are running on the same code base and version.  It's easier to enhance and support.  The community also tends to be more engaged and collaborative.  Nothing harms the long-term value of an ERP and the agility of company than an overly-customized deployment.  This is generally the problem with many on-prem and private cloud solutions.  They can become impossible to lifecycle.  Most organizations struggle enough with implementation and are not equipped handle a brownfield deployment.

Cloud ERP has its tradeoffs.  One must put a lot of faith in their partner(s).  But, over the long-run, there tends to be more functionality available that can be adopted practically and a more robust ecosystem driving it.  This is why I like Plex and Workday.  They're a stretch for some SMB, but they can deliver massive value if they're fully embraced.

Here's my response on a previous ERP question:

All migrations have been done with SQL.  Most integrations I've observed were through SQL and some with COM.  GP, at least on-prem, has a fairly weak and inconsistently-implemented data model.  I've seen some, no joke, AS/400 migrations and integrations go smoother.  For some reason, GP really attracts a lot of database abuse.  Think hijacked columns, redundant tables, poor normalization, etc.  It appears the community tends to modify the schema to customize canned reports or functionality rather than develop/extend their own.  It's fragile.

For these reasons, I would advise proceeding with caution integrating with the database.  Some ERP apps have special transaction tables or stored procedures for integration.  They usually have some sort of validation and enforce business logic like an API would.  By comparison, GP appears to be a lot less formal about this.  It's not that SQL can't work.  Be cognizant of the data model and logic.  The integration will have to respect this.  A ""blind"" insert statement with enough assumptions can create problems down the road.

If it's on-prem, I would look into the .NET SDK or third-party GP integrations.  There is a whole industry of GP integration products and services.  You will be hard-pressed to find something that will expose GP as an MQTT client.  More likely, there will be HTTP/S or SOAP interfaces.  The UNS can be setup to invoke these.

I can't speak to the M365 cloud version.  I don't know if they performed a lift-and-shift (i.e., private cloud) or they rebuilt it as multi-tenant.  If it's multi-tenant, there will be less uncertainty about the database and more opportunities for integration.  Are there documented APIs?  Check out if there are any hooks into MS Flows or another integration product in the M365 platform.","","üëè (1)"

My comment/inquiry about PDM/PLM and the UNS was about publishing part data (e.g., part no, bom, routings, part specifications) for other nodes to consume.  This was coming from a context of the design and engineering of technical products for high-volume production.  Due to complexity and iterations, my preference is to model these things abstractly and independent of customer orders/releases.  In my experience, tightly coupling everything to a customer order tends to create overly rigid business processes.  I recognize this approach may not be appropriate for all environments (e.g., make-to-print, job shops).

That's exciting to hear someone has thought about machining use cases for the UNS.  I've wondered about this too.  Unfortunately, a lot of CNCs transfer g-code through file transfer protocols (e.g., FTP) rather than through a native field protocol.  I believe the g-code resides in a different memory object than where the native protocols read/write to.  I have not begun to imagine what an SpB / FTP gateway to pass contents from large text files would look like.  There exist Direct Numeric Control (DNC) solutions on that market that can work with CAM and PLM environments.  At the bare minimum, they could be tied in with meta data (e.g., part no, operation, program name, version).

Product realization is, no doubt, an important of digital transformation.  It's a really inefficient process for many manufacturers.  And it can cause a lot of problems downstream.  All the planning, execution, and automation systems need a ""clean"" producer of this information to work seamlessly.","","üëç (1)"

What I meant is customer orders or at least customer order forecasts are generated in the ERP. The order will always have a product code, this should be the case in discrete as well as bulk manufacturing. In the discrete case that product code should link to the top level assembly of the design in the PDM space. When I‚Äôve previously talked to Walker on discord about including designs in the UNS he suggested populating with static links to the design files. Well at least that‚Äôs what I think he was suggesting. If the ERP had a master data field for that product code that pointed to the PDM you could drag it directly from the ERP into the UNS. The MES would schedule orders to the shop floor and bring up the relevant links to the design data for the operators.  I see this being most useful with a PDM that is available on the shop floor. If the designs are good they should contain all the bom data and links within the PDM. Thoughts?

ERP topics can be tough to discuss because the approaches of product realization and commercialization can vary so much by organization.  The fact that there exist ERPs with hundreds of options to support order management exemplifies this.  My point was that a lot of business processes can be driven independent of customer orders.  For example, a BOM might feed into different parts for multiple customer orders.  The engineering of said BOM might be governed more by internal requirements than customer requirements.  As a result, it may not be optimal to explicitly model by customer order in the way that say a contract manufacturer or a job shop would.

As for distributing g-code, leveraging UNS is an interesting concept.  It's all theoretically possible and I don't dispute the potential.  When I think about the major products in this space (e.g., CAM, DNC, CNC), they're tied together with explicit point-to-point connections and, often, dedicated interfaces.  Typically, but not definitively, there aren't any other producers or consumers of this data.  This is not an axiom to live by, but a mere practical observation.  Rather than engineering conversions from file transfer protocols into a UNS and back out for each machine type, it might be more practical to leverage a traditional DNC infrastructure for program transfer but expose its meta data to other application nodes via a UNS.  For example, do other nodes need raw g-code or do they need to do know information about it (e.g., Part No, Rev, Program Name)?

This could be an example, as Walker has put it, where discrete connections are not totally replaced but reduced.  Innovating with industrial tech frequently requires ""hybrid"" approaches of old and new.","","üëè (1)"

Upon posting, CAM calls for part rev number, job number, submits new program rev number to ERP. When the pmc loads the program, all these are also inputted into macro vars on the control which are then picked up and submitted back to the ERP so we know that what we want running is in fact running. If you centralize the data there you also have the benefit of being able to cross reference tooling libraries twice or three times (not sure what scale you're talking about, but i'm going to assume for the purposes of this example that the tools are being put into the machine by humans)","",""

Interestingly, it wasn't that long ago where memory limitations of controllers were a pretty big problem.

Basically, to compensate for any communication issues, the programs are architected with breaks for the machine to ""dwell"" and await instructions fed by an external device.

While Netsuite runs on an Oracle database, it's not really a traditional Oracle product like Oracle ERP or JD Edwards.  They were acquired by Oracle in 2016.  Netsuite is a multi-tenant cloud ERP.  That is, the application code base and its underlying database are shared by all of its customers.  This means you cannot modify the database schema or make direct writes.  Instead, everything will go through APIs.  Netsuite exposes itself with REST or SOAP interfaces.  They do have integration libraries that can be embedded into a program, but for Ignition, API calls will probably the best route.

Find out what your client is currently doing with Netsuite (e.g., CRM, Order Management, Supply Chain Management, Accounting).  Next, find out what they're currently manually logging in the system.  Are they updating orders, inventory, cost, shipments, etc?  Identify what are the most common transactions and what are most laborious.  Finally, you'll want someone at the client familiar with Netsuite APIs.  Ideally, they should be able to replicate what a business process owner (e.g., order management) does with the Netsuite GUI over an API.  If they don't, that's okay.  You can do this work for them and partner up with someone.  At the very least, you'll need someone internally that owns the business processes and can validate the integrations are working.

If the client does not have the capability to support this kind of thing, I'd suggest getting their Netsuite implementation partner involved.  They'll be more technically aclimated with what the client has.  If they don't have a good relationship with them or they don't have any experience working with a system integrator, reach out to Netsuite for a partner who has.","","üëè (1)"

"766684226455207996","bright_hummingbird_31342","2021-10-05T23:47:50.0440000+08:00","I'm not sure what video you're referencing.  I'll chime in on the topic in general.

B2MML is an XML representation of ISA95.  Some ERPs expose their master data model or parts of it as B2MML.  B2MML can be used to exchange data in standardized way between ERP, SCM, MES, etc.  It can also be used for archival and traceability in some regulated industries.

In practice, B2MML is sort of like OPC-UA information models.  The adoption of it is not broad or consistent.  B2MML-based integrations invariably require customization.  As a result, it's much more common to leverage the native data representation and interfaces in applications for integration.  Ask any product manager or implementer of these apps and they'll have all sorts of thoughts on it.  Due to the varied adherence to standards and implementations of MES itself, plug-n-play in the MES world is a challenge.  

With that said, if available, B2MML can function as a familiar schema to work with.  It can take time learning the native interfaces.  And sometimes, underlying data models will have subtle differences based on implementation or version.  Without knowledge of the differences, it can be a challenge working with native interfaces.  It might require using a specific API or specific version of an API to get to the data.

B2MML is worth being familiar with as a ""conduit"" into some ERPs.  Understanding how to move records (e.g., BOMs, routings, orders, assets, workcenters) through this conduit is necessary to create of the business structure and state that is the UNS.  Presently, most ERPs will not have native MQTT SpB interface.  ERP integration is not simply a matter of pointing it to a broker.  Knowledge of where data resides and how to get it is required.  Regardless of the interface and format (e.g., B2MML, BAPI/RFC, custom web service, SQL sproc), one should be prepared to adapt these into the UNS.  Everything from tools (e.g., Sepasoft, HighByte) to custom scripts can help solve this problem.","",""

For example, a manufacturer may have stood up a specific MES for their industry.  The solution or its ecosystem may have been built around exchanging data with B2MML.  Taking this into consideration, the ERP may have been stood up with an integration module that supports B2MML.  It might be a preferred integration for the MES or implementation partners.  This makes the manufacturer is essentially a B2MML shop.  Even if there are other interfaces available, most integration knowledge will be B2MML centric.

So, if the UNS needs a list of BOMs or orders for other applications to consume, understanding how B2MML exposes this data becomes relevant.","",""

- B2MML (or IEC62264 part 4) is a transaction message. It is almost always request/response, and while it is entirely possible to handle request/response through asynchonous publish and subscribe, it creates a whole bunch of headaches.
- B2MML messages often do not refer to the current state. An Operations Response message my be sent for the previous order for example, so the B2MML message is often inconsistent with the current state of equipment.
- the messages themselves are complex and not completely hierarchical, so you have to put the whole payload into one message, which brings it back to the first point.

""Event Driven"" architectures should not be seen as a silver bullet to solve every problem. While they do solve a bunch of specific problems, they also create a bunch of their own problems. Integration between MES and ERP is mostly transactional, and sometimes event driven.

What I typically do is use the event from PubSub to trigger a synchronous transaction. For example, lets say we need to update the ERP when an order starts on a machine. The MES would subscribe to the UNS to detect when the order state on the machine has changed. This would trigger a synchronous transaction between the ERP and the MES.","","üëç (1)"

I was referring to B2MML in a brownfield context.  I should have been more clear in saying that one might need to adapt B2MML nodes into the UNS.  This doesn't mean that the UNS will have B2MML connections and payloads, but that it will have connections (e.g., MQTT) and payloads (e.g., SpB + JSON) derived from B2MML.

This is similar to the way one would approach a PLC with a native interface such as EtherNet/IP.  The UNS would not poll a PLC for CIP messages, but rather a gateway would.  A gateway would extract the relevant contents of the CIP messages and publish them to the UNS in a way that meets the requirements (e.g., report by exception, edge driven).

The structure and content of a UNS is often derived from ISA95 in some form.  B2MML, based on ISA95 as well as supported by some ERP and MES apps, can serve as an adapted ""brownfield"" connection.","",""

When the initial ""Plexus Online"" product was conceived in the late 90s, it was built on MS SQL Server and hosted in their office.  There was no AWS or Azure at the time.  It would be another half-decade before S3 or EC2 were launched.  From what I've gathered, there are a few reasons why it's not fully on a major cloud provider.  First, part of it is architecture.  They were cloud before there was cloud.  Building for one's own cloud is different than building for someone else's.  Manufacturers value stability and it can be non-trivial to migrate to new architecture.  Second, at least as of a few years ago, there were some performance limitations.  Plex is super transactional.  Customers hit it really hard.  Most transactions are API calls originating from SCADA systems at customer plants.  Some of the underlying stored procedures are mind blowing.  They push SQL to the limits.

This should reside somewhere in the MES layer. Even when we integrate with WMS or E-commerce, we don't try to bring everything to the ERP.

Most people try to relate an ERP with an app or a technical system, but unfortunately, it's much more than that. The business logic is so nested that it's almost a dark tunnel with no end in sight that even people with over 200 implementations and 20+ years of experience struggle to understand. 

I have not met a single person who would understand more than 20-30% of the ERP systems. 

Now, this experience would be similar to an instance of an interview with an economist who set the policies for 60 years. They asked if he had a complete grasp of the economy and his answer was that he had no clue how the economy truly works. He could probably explain the implications of a few policies. 

I remember you comparing manufacturing with Airline and if Mainframe systems are still used. The largest ERP (or a transactional system) is not the ERP system you use. It's not as complex. The largest ERP system in my mind is Sabre, which is used by most airlines as a booking system that most airline brokers and marketplaces use. A lot of companies tried to replace that system, but every time they tried, they have always failed. And as far as my understanding goes, I don't see a possibility of it being replaced in the next 20 years. The last project was done by HP called JetStream, which I believe was still a failed attempt. By the way, Sabre is just an operational system. It's not even a financial system. The financial systems tend to be far more complex.

The reason why most software OEMs ask you to utilize their API is that irrespective of whether you process the transactions through the UI or through API, or for that matter EDI,  all transactions must go through the same business logic.

Now, when you bypass the API and try to hit the DB directly, you are bypassing the business logic layer, which has been tested by thousands of companies millions of times and you are overriding the core business logic. Your assumption is going to be that by looking at a bunch of fields, you can probably forecast the implications that your changes would have on the state of the entire system. But now go back to my original point that most people understand 20-30% of the ERP systems. So while you might feel that you have your testing strategy figured out but most likely your changes will break something else, because you don't know what you don't know.

In their case, they hit the DB directly to input the sales order, inv transactions from a distributor, but they forgot that when you enter the line on the sales order, there is massively nested business logic for lot control and how inventory will be put away. In some cases, companies might even have a predictive algorithm to predict the appropriate bin for the product and which lot number the inventory should come out. They built custom logic to mimic the same behavior that you would have from the UI assuming that the logic was going to work. Initially, first, the whole control logic was a mess and it never worked. So then they tried to take out the lot control and then the system started even breaking further. Most products will go to the wrong bins...","","üëç (3)"

Did I mention that they ended up losing $3.5 million in an ERP system that never worked for them? Now they are preparing to go after legally with everyone involved in the project to claim the damages. It will be fun and we will see where they end up.

This is my life on a daily basis.

If MQTT were to add a more standardized model for ACLs then it could perhaps be used for more ""business sensitive"" data.  Ironically, this is again where hybridizing brokers to support a REST API (for defining and managing ACLs in this case) makes a lot of sense.  I'd love to see a standardized set of REST APIs defined in the MQTT standard that brokers can implement for this stuff, for topic/metadata definition and browsing/querying, historical data access, method invocation (request/response) and so on.

Here is one story, you can literally kill your company through just a read-only scenario.

A naive sales director was so fascinated by technology because she saw these enterprise reps carrying tabs to the customer meetings. She wished she could do the same. So she created the requirement spec that she wanted to have the accessibility of order history for the past 5 years, so she could show to the customer who she could barely meet once per year during their annual meeting, to show what they ordered in the past 5 years, how their account performance was, and then if there is any problem with a specific sales order, she could discuss the issues and discuss potential remedies.

Now here is the problem with this read-only transaction:

1. pulling 5 years' worth of data is a massive lift from the system performance perspective. You can literally kill the operational system
2. the more data you keep in your ERP system, the slower it gets because of the indexing requirements, etc.
3. tablet is not an appropriate form factor for such a heavy transaction
4. performing such transactions in real-time could slow down everyone else and perhaps may result in database locks etc.

We have seen disasters even when you are going to do point-to-point integration through API as you need to throttle the load etc while integrating. Got a couple of stories there as well where we have seen architectural disasters even through API. but at least, with APIs, you are not fixing electrical circuits with bare hands.","","üëç (2)"

In reality, yes it's your operational and financial core and is meant to be the transactional system for core financial and operational processes, but it's not meant to be a TRASH CAN. 

You only keep the data that is going to be centrally used across the systems as far as operational and financial implications go. The other things you are better off doing in other systems that are designed for it. Each company requires at least 4-5 major systems along with an ERP and MES, the key is always in process design and architecture that's where the trick is.

The people who claim that there is nothing rigid about manufacturing have very little understanding of how businesses are supposed to run.

For some industry verticals and in some corners of the world, it's sometimes one of the few options.  The unfortunate reality of the SAP ecosystem is that it's among the worst for an inexperienced/uneducated company to navigate.  The only ecosystem with more bad actors taking advantage of this is probably Oracle.  Deep ERP and MES implementations require a ""DTMA""-like alignment across the organization.  There must be some pre-requisites.

The issue with lack of success is multifaceted:

Ability to make decisions in a timely manner.

IT managed the project as a typical application deployment.  There was no emphasis on defining and managing the underlying business processes.  If they can't grasp or perform line-of-business functions with reasonable competency, it will be hard for them to create business processes.  This is where cross-functional teams come into place.

IT is accustomed to interfacing with employees and not automation.  While humans are not reliable, they can adapt to new interfaces and processes by intuition.  Automation is the opposite way around.  Industrial automation is rigid and has its own interfaces.  It's almost always easier to adapt to it than the other way around.

With respect to business processes, there is a lack of accountability.  Successful implementations typical have some sort of departmental liaisons or business process owners.  This is especially useful for solving ""garbage in, garbage out"" problems.  Users can use and abuse.  Owners are invested in maintaining.

OT has made too narrow of assumptions of all the different consumers, directly or indirectly, of the data they generate.  Ruthless adherence to getting product out the door under any circumstance can create tribal knowledge or discontinuities from the rest of the org.

There are these natural limits of what can be swapped out and where to integrate.  ""Good enough"" can easily beat out trying to resolve dichotomies.  Short of creating and maintaining interfaces that completely hide the complexity, there is a non-trivial cost of creating the awareness of what an integration can or cannot do.  It can be hell for users jumping between systems.  The unknowns and corner cases can wreak havoc.  As much as we'd like, we still don't live in a world of seamless micro-services that can be interchanged.

One of the greatest challenges for consumers in this space is that they are not privy to the ""inside baseball"" of the market.  There are very high-levels of mystification, both intentional and unintentional, in the ERP and MES space.  It takes deep experience to sort through it.  Even seasoned professionals require considerable time to vet a solution.

If a vendor would like to defend their solution, there is nothing stopping them from chiming in.  I don't believe anyone should be scrutinized for disclosing a solution they have seen works well in the real world.  If a partner does not believe this, they probably should not be a partner.  Ultimately, transparency benefits everyone.  For vendors, they know where their product falls short and they can improve.  For manufacturers, they can make informed decisions and mitigate risk of project failure.  This even reduces uncertainty and cost in the sales cycle.

If you're not comfortable, I totally understand.  There are certainly valid reasons.  But, being able to hear someone say ""I have observed X work well for Y, but not Z"" unfiltered is invaluable.

I literally grew up in Tibco's backyard and have seen one of the largest (low-code implementations) and potential disasters with low-code. 

While the premise of low-code is strong and yes it will cut down the development time to some degree, it will not help with the design, architecture, or requirement gathering. In fact, the business logic is still the same regardless of whether you code your integration logic in one of the programming languages or in a low code program. Also, programmers (including me) very rarely appreciate the inefficiencies introduced by the visual interfaces of the no-code platforms as we can write code/debug way faster in Python, Java, .Net, etc. You might want to review the interview with Ted Needleman who writes for Accounting Today and reviews ERP systems for a living. He was involved with the development of one of the first ERP systems and have had the pleasure of getting invited by Bill Gates to review Microsoft's offerings. https://www.elevatiq.com/episode/user-friendly-erp-system/ He talks about this point.

The talented individual that you seem to be referring to in your note is similar to my skillset who has a background with Sarbanes Oxley and maintaining master data governance (deep knowledge of accounting, inventory, sales and operations planning, and regulatory compliance as well as multiple system expertise including programming) across systems.

These challenges would still be the same regardless of the advancements in the technologies. If anything, you will require more consulting time when you have to patch together multiple systems.

A WMS solution is typically involved, even the smaller ones when you have a need for the barcoding. But since you are going to carry low amounts of inventory, you might not need barcoding. I have never seen machine builders using barcoding for their machine division, even for the mid to large-sized shops. Now in terms of managing your inventory, here are some areas you might want to look at in terms of feature set:

1. Where are your major pain points in maintaining inventory? Do you maintain separate inventory for the finished machines and spare parts? What's the revenue/inventory share there? Do you use inventory on service/maintenance orders? Do you need to manage the inventory there?
2. Is the motive for this acquisition financial or operational? How happy are you with your inventory levels right now? Is your physical and digital inventory in sync? Can you plan your inventory when you need it and where you need it? How are your BOMs structured? Do you use projects instead of BOMs for your custom machine build? Do you have any BOMs inside your projects?
3. How is your procurement structured? Do you need to plan your inventory the way you buy from your vendors?

A lot of people in this community are going to hate me for this but I am a big proponent of not digitizing the processes unless you have a clear sense of where you are losing the money and why you are losing it. Until that point, the simplest solution is always manual and spreadsheets.

As per the suggestions from others, QuickBooks Commerce is slightly more trade-centric, so not sure how it will work in your case, especially if you might be using a lot of point solutions. ODOO inventory may be better suited.","",""

the financial perspective would be cost savings due to overarching planning of inventory, better restructuring of inventory to utilize cost savings, and better aligning sales, ops, and procurement processes as they interact with inventory to utilize cost savings due to volume discounts, etc.

the operational perspective would be, hey I needed 4 parts here or by this date to complete my machine, but now I am stuck as I thought I had 4 parts, but turns out I can't find the fourth one.

But this effective management is not possible unless all of your processes are tightly integrated, which is what an ERP system typically provides. 

If you are going to use several fragmented systems, it's very hard to get that centralized view of the inventory, which is critical for planning, scaling, and growth. 

But yeah, if you keep a managed and predictable buffer and you don't have any other ways of solving this problem, then keeping a bunch of extra nuts and bolts that cost a fraction of cents wouldn't hurt.

Sometimes it might take as long as 2 weeks to get all the executives in one room to finalize their most basic components such as how your entities and sites will be structured in the system, what your reporting architecture will be, how you will be structuring your BOMs etc. Also, with any implementation, if you are not going to streamline your business processes and cleanse your data, you will hardly gain any benefits with your new ERP, even if the system may be as capable as S/4 HANA.

It can work if an org is truly competent and committed to managing the solution.  Most internal apps don't get lifecycled like they should.  I tend to believe that most EPR functions are not truly differentiating.  For this reason, I'm more inclined to recommend adopting an off-the-shelf solution and extending it with customizations/integrations where needed.

I'd advise partnering up with an ERP consulting firm or perhaps even a very cooperative and knowledgeable customer.  The only way to really get acquainted is through experience.  While it's not say that ""rolling your own"" ERP is bad experience, it's probably not the right experience to help manufacturers.  For example, your customers may use an ERP for manufacturing business processes and your firm may use it primarily for services and distribution.  The kinds of problems and solutions will be so different.  The other issue is scale.  What works for a small business is dramatically different than what works for medium or large business.

It seems like Odoo and some integrations might be appropriate for your org.  I would even kick the tires on commercial solutions.  Don't write off your business and its headcount as too small for many solutions.  Some orgs, especially today, are super efficient and may have high output (e.g., revenue, volume, projects) per employee.  Or, you might be growing.

Based on the stage of your company, Odoo or ERPNext is probably a better fit as long as they can support the localization, taxation, etc of your country. Also, you don't have to automate everything from day one. Your focus should be on sales and marketing, which will help you grow faster than worrying about system implementation or hiring expensive people that will help you automate when manual/ad-hoc processes may be faster considering the stage of your business.

If you compare this with the content creation or writing process, you are at a phase where your goal is to dump as many ideas on a piece of paper. Your goal is not to create the most structured writing. Once you have enough ideas on paper, then you need to figure out what else you might be able to do to improve and streamline your processes, and perhaps introduce another solution after a few years that can teach you how to run your business in a structured manner.

I would advise against the homegrown solutions. It's just not worth the time.  Your core competency is not to create ERP solutions. Your core competency is to sell your products and services, which should be your focus.

Think of BPM as more of the business process documentation captured in a piece of software, where you can drill into the business perspective, process perspective, and then tech perspective. 

While the concept is powerful, it has never been mainstream. And it is typically used by companies that are very heavy in software development, custom dev, etc. For example, media, telco, tech, logistics, etc. Also, it is more prevalent in the CRM play as opposed to the ERP play. One of the largest vendors in the BPM space is Pegasystems, which is very heavy in the CRM play. There are other vendors such as Tibco ActiveMetrix, WebMethods, etc but again, they are primarily used in banking, telco, media, tech, etc.

While there are other vendors who claim to improve visibility into the large ERP implementations, at least I have not seen it majorly used any of the corporations unless an exec is super sold on this and wanted to implement it as they had too much money or time to do something.

Everything is low code these days, even the coding platforms are trying to improve the user experience of developers. And they don't want them to waste time with unnecessary coding. So not sure where you draw the line.

There are two aspects of it. One is the documentation piece, which would be a platform such as ARIS and its competitors. Their role is to document the business processes inside the software in a BPMN notation. Typically they comply with the enterprise architecture frameworks such as TOGAF and Prince2. These tools don't focus on the execution. They focus primarily on the documentation of business processes from 3-4 different perspectives.

iPaaS would not be suitable for such workflow. You need a BPM. These interactions are far more common in the industries such as banking, insurance, telecom, and real estate, with so many front-line workers interacting/touching the loan app etc. So they are the right candidate for BPM tools.

**BPM as Service**
BPM can be another term for outsourcing or managed services.  Companies like Avalara or ADP are good examples.  Let‚Äôs use payroll as an example.  A lot of ERP/HCM suites may have Time & Attendance, Time Off, or even some Payroll functionality.  But, there is often a services component to payroll such as tax and compliance.  This is a unique business process that varies over time and across localities.  As a result, it's often paired with software and services from a third-party payroll provider.  It can be optimal to decouple this from other systems of record.

**BPM as Workflow**
BPM can also be catch-all phrase for workflow engines.  Legacy applications often required extensive customization to accommodate business processes that were not natively supported.  This was costly to lifecycle and make changes to.  As a result, BPM suites became prevalent to complement other applications.  BPMs reduce the engineering effort in managing business processes.  

The next generation applications have much more configuration and integration capabilities embedded within.  These platform capabilities are thought of as a core product and other applications are designed to interface with them.  Workday‚Äôs ‚ÄòBusiness Process Framework‚Äô is a good example of this.

For the industrial automation folks, this is like the difference between a legacy SCADA such as RSView/FTView vs Ignition.  One was designed for specific purposes while the other was designed for the same thing, but with a platform that can be applied to unspecified purposes.","","üôå (1)"

**BPM in Digital Transformation**
Next-generation applications, with embedded workflow engines and platform capabilities, should hopefully reduce the need for traditional BPM.  The era of building out on-prem, point-to-point integrations between specific versions of software is over.  Where I do see BPM having new life is with products such as ServiceNow or even IIoT platforms such as Ignition.  Simply put, these solutions allow users to solve problems without the challenges of the past.  They can be applied and extended to countless business processes.

The rigidity is subject to how tight your data structure needs to be and how much control you need with your processes. Compare this with NotePad and Excel, which is more rigid and better? Notepad might be easier as you can write anything you like. Excel might be slightly more rigid for you as it might throw errors here and there when you try to enter data. Each tool is designed for a specific purpose and they all have a role to play in architecture depending upon how much money you have in your pockets and how much you hate your life. The challenge is going to be in making them work together.

Now to your question, while you can hook up your PLC with ERP. Ideally, ERP must not contain any of the operational data that is used at the plant level. When I say operational data, I don't mean part number, qty, etc. Since this information is likely to be used by multiple systems, you need to keep it centralized. And that drives what needs to be in an ERP and what doesn't. The operational data such as temp, pressure, how heat valves are performing, it is too much information for ERP. So it must reside in the operational system like MES. Just like if you had imagery for your eComm system, ERP is a terrible place to store them, unless they need to be used by multiple teams as instructions on a BOM. So why do you need an MES system? Because your operational needs to be deeper than what ERP or manual processes can provide.","","üî• (1),üíØ (1)"

I've seen that done in very simple processes like mining, where the basic process description can be stated as ""Dig up earth, put earth on train"" and Production orders last for 1 month, and only 1 product is made (Earth).
In many manufacturing verticals, the process is infinitely more complex, and there is a big divergence between the level of detail that is required to control the process in the PLC, and the level of detail that the ERP cares about, so there is then a mapping that is required between those levels of detail.
Of course, it's possible to build an MES into your PLC code. An MES is really a conceptual grouping of a set of functions focussed around the execution of a production schedule. I've certainly built PLC code in the past that had all the functions of an MES, but it was not something that could ever be moved to a different production line, or copied into another factory.

So my take on the answer to your question is:
 - in some very simple processes, there is no real difference between the level of detail that the ERP is looking for, and the level of detail required to control the process, and in these processes there can be limited need for MES functions.
- in all other processes, there is a need to manage MES activities ( Check ISA95 Part 3 for what is meant by MES activities)
- MES activities can be handled in PLC code, ERP code or something in the middle like an MES system. Separating the system that performs MES activities  from ERP and PLC allows it to be more easily deployed across an organisation.","",""

As far as my understanding of the cloud ERP world goes, you will not find device or app licenses, the way you had in the on-prem world. In the cloud ERP world, you need to go through either the named licenses or consumption-based. The named licenses would be similar to how you would use the app. Most ERP systems should allow you to generate a key that you can pass while testing using APIs.

It's targeted for IT and devs who don't know how to spend their money and will fall for the coolness factor. 

They are the only ones who charge per recipe. Now it's very hard to predict how many workflows you will need for your integration. Sure, they are going to argue that you know what they don't charge for test workflows, only the ones that are running in prod. But no one else does. Even Celigo has a variable for the recipe. But they sell in blocks, which is linear with connectors, just to prevent overconsumption, which I completely understand. 

If the integration is going to be this expensive, I am better off writing my own code and deploying on AWS or Azure. In my experience, while you might not think about Boomi as you may be too small, they seem to have the most friendly pricing for SMBs, and at times comparable to Celigo, which is super small in size, similar to what other vendors are trying to sell like SAP, Infor. 

I think IFS uses Boomi. Epicor is aligned with Jitterbit. Microsoft hasn't figured out what an iPaaS really is.

Great points on iPaaS vs. custom.

Most of the Plex integrations have been historically custom.  A lot of these date back (and built upon) the legacy SOAP web services that were stood up before cloud and multi-tenancy was really a thing.  Middleware was very on-prem orientated back then.  Boomi is the unofficially favored iPaaS.  It shows up in more complex integrations involving two-tier ERP and financial consolidation (e.g., Workday, SAP, Hyperion, OneStream).  Some of the partners offer maintained integrations for easily marketable things like payroll.  For machine integration, the partners are typically leveraging SCADA platforms like Tridium Niagara or Ignition.

Because there is so much burden on the customer, I've seen scenarios where Boomi was eventually ditched for custom.  I think iPaaS works out well when the connections are ""maintained"" in sufficient numbers by the vendor and/or community.  This creates a marketplace-of-sorts for certainty and reliability in integration projects.  It's far easier to be patient ""n+1"" than patient 0.  But, when one is merely leveraging a generic HTTP interface and they're solely responsible for everything, the licensing costs can outweigh the benefits over time.  As firms become better at managing integrations and keeping their scale/scope stable, it can be economical to go custom.  But, they must be prepared to commit to life cycling it.","",""

I was surprised to see Microsoft.  The whole Azure + 365 thing is certainly compelling and has an interesting future, but I don't know of it can make up for the lack of ""last mile"" or vertical-specific functionality.  Perhaps things have improved?

If the list is to be manufacturing-friendly, would you consider Kenandy / Rootstock as a contender?  Or is it too niche?

I really don't think RootStock has a ton of market share in the ERP space. They are trying to attract only the SFDC enthusiasts who just wants to do everything inside Salesforce regardless of how expensive it might be. I would say FinancialForce is a  much more developed ERP product in the Salesforce ecosystem than RootStock and competes head-to-head with SAP.  Salesforce+FinancialForce+Workday is very common. SFDC will ensure that the deal doesn't go to MS or SAP as they will lose control on the deal. And that's probably the reason why FinancialForce and RootStock were born to begin with. They are all funded by Salesforce in the background. They want to own as much custom development as possible on the SFDC platform. And we have seen million-dollar disasters with Salesforce.

We haven't come across a lot of Rootstocks, to be honest. It's very rare to see them in our deals. Not sure how strong the product is. It didn't appear very strong on paper. It might have deeper configurator capabilities because of Salesforce CPQ.

Boomi has been around informally for a while. I think the vision was to make ""two-tier"" ERP more seamless to sell the MES and operationally-focused ERP modules up-market. They know they weren't going to displace ERP at conglomerates or larger firms, but they could potentially at the operational business units running disparate or legacy solutions. Unfortunately, I think there was so much variation and complexity in these up-market implementations that it probably wasn't worth the cost of inking a formal deal. The vision was to make Workday and Boomi official partners, but I think they chickened out once they saw the cost. Also, various acquisition interests over the years likely complicated matters further.  And there's also the endless ""UX"" interface project they've been working on for nearly a decade.

Boomi became an unofficially favored solution for implementations among customers and partners because they already began to go down that path. It was easier to build upon the work that was already done. Because it wasn't an official partnership or offering (aka ""supported""), customers still owned most of the risk. Once one knows what they're integrating and has the talent to do so, ditching Boomi could be economical. Unless a customer has a comprehensive use of iPaaS, the benefits can be limited if the vendor support isn't there -- particularly if the integration is well scoped/scaled.

Plex's legacy APIs are basically stored procedures / data sources exposed through a SOAP interfaces. The newer APIs are HTTP (what some might call REST).  Some expose the same data sources, but others are more intent-based and sophisticated. These are less convoluted and ""kill more birds with less stones"" than the legacy ones.  Some have been marketed as specific connectors for more popular integrations (e.g., SPC Checksheet Data, Machine Integration, Payroll, Sales Tax).","",""

1. The ERP needs at least contextual information to be able to control inventory, costing, and scheduling. Some people might argue that scheduling belongs to the MES or shop floor systems. But you need to define a clear boundary of who is responsible for what. And what data exchange needs to happen in both systems to facilitate this collaboration. 
2. Inventory and master data are where all the problems start with best-of-breed systems. So as long as you have a clear state of the inventory and product data and how that will be used by the downstream systems such as the shop floor is critical for the success of the architecture. It doesn't matter which path you take, whether you would like to go for best-of-breed or integrated, as long as you have a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each system and how they will be collaborating on the shared data. Obviously, if you are buying integrated systems such as ERP, it will always be less expensive once you account for all the costs. The more integration points, the higher chances of failure, and the more expensive it gets. 
3. The biggest challenge is always the organizational alignment and politics within the organizations. And how every department feels that they are better than the others whether you talk about shop floor or sales or marketing. The successful digital transformation requires a clear state of each system and what role they will be playing in the architecture.

Again, I don't think the tech can be blamed for business results. It's the people who implemented these systems and the leadership who didn't put enough effort into thinking through the architecture and what operational implications the architecture is going to have. 

I am not suggesting that best-of-breed doesn't have value. But that alone won't solve any of your problems.","",""

The intent of the video is not to suggest that you should try to integrate 200 best-of-breed apps. In fact, the video also highlights that even the major ERP vendors struggle with integrating their own products when they have trillions  of dollars on their balance sheets. 

So what are the odds that you as a manufacturer will be successful with the same integration? 

Let's face it. Integration is hard and expensive, especially when you are going to do it at the enterprise scale. Yes, you will need several best-of-breed apps. But the more you have, the more trouble you are asking for yourself. Also, the products he pointed out don't even fall in the purview of the ERP. 

CRM, eCommerce, MES, P2P, HCM, and finally  ERP - are very different product categories and you might need all of them depending upon the complexity of your operations. Today's architecture is already very complex with millions of channels and touch points with changing customers' expectations. Now you have to throw in 20 more apps just because you feel that best-of-breed is cool, you are looking at millions of dollars of lost investments with failed integrations. 

Lol, this is what we do for a living. And the first piece of advice we are going to have is how you can consolidate system footprint in your architecture. The more moving parts you are going to have in the architecture, the more difficult it is to integrate.","",""

But as far as my understanding goes, the intent of UNS architecture is not to extend the operational boundaries. The fundamentals of UNS architecture are not new. It has been used inside apps and in business apps, for many decades. The same concepts are being utilized to implement the industry4.0 architecture in the form of UNS. 

But note that, you might feel that the world of operations or Industry4.0 is going to take over the world or over the enterprise IT. But unfortunately, every single department feels the same way, whether you talk about sales, procurement, or HR. That's how complex the enterprise architecture has become. I see UNS as the collaborator for operational apps. I really don't think it will replace the existing integration tool in the architecture. In fact, the UNS might feed the context to the existing integration tools. 

By the way, not many people understand that even the world of integration is very complex, and not every tool is a fit for every use case. They are typically used for a specific use case. And UNS would be a fit for very specific operational integration scenarios and not meant to be a replacement for existing tools or integration tech.","",""

In fact, I talk a lot about NOT shoehorning everything inside an ERP. But that advice is not meant to be binary. The intent of this advice is to evaluate each case and see what makes sense. In general, the fewer data stores you have in your architecture, the easier it is to integrate and manage. The more databases, the more variabilities, and the more reconciliation points. And a surefire way to fail!

If I recall correctly, they were championing Zuora as the best-of-breed application for subscription billing. Until they failed! And by that time, these capabilities became equally comparable in NetSuite or other ERP systems. So they started advising against Zuora. Also, they started advising against Workday, which is supposed to be one of the most powerful HCM systems out there. If best-of-breed architecture is so easy to pull off, why would they advise against Workday?

There are many variables to assess the fit for a best-of-breed architecture. What is the intent of the system? Is it an analytical system? Or a transactional system? Does it have its own data store? If so, does it touch the master data? If it touches master data, does it simply use or change the state of master data? If it changes, does it augment or replace? These are just the 30K foot level questions you need to be asking. But evaluating these decisions requires very deep expertise in enterprise architecture. And not a checklist approach. If you have never done this before, it is in your best interest to get something pre-integrated. Then worrying about the integration mess. And that's probably the reason why ERP systems exist, to begin with. üôÇ","",""

Best-of-breed apps have their merits as they reduce training time. If you have hourly workers, it might be harder for them to navigate on ERP screens. So you kind of reduce their workflow and simplify the apps. So that ops can progress with their transactions faster. And then finance can reconcile it later. But in this scenario, you are simply delaying the problems. That might be OK for some businesses. But again, you need to assess the ROI to understand what's superior for your specific operations.

Typically if the purpose of integration is just to analyze the data, no one cares as long as you are not killing the system with a massive workload. And if you are moving data for analytical purposes, you can do whatever you want and use as many best-of-breed apps as you like. The problem is when the analytical layer starts to hijack the operational workflow. That's not a good place to be.

In general, there are three ways of integrating any enterprise apps and they all have their pros and cons 1) UI-driven integration (really fragile and not to be taken seriously üôÇ ) 2) service-layer integration 3) database-layer integration. The holy grail of integration will always be to integrate at the DB layer level, the way MS approaches their integration. But that is not always possible if you are a company that grew through acquisition. Because the underlying data model and tech are going to be so different. And that's why most companies attempt service-layer integration, which is also commonly referred to as API-driven integration.

Yes, that is true, but that is not to say that best-of-breed will always be cheaper, even today. 

In fact, you have far higher chances of failing with best-of-breed than with an integrated app. Because with integrated apps, the same codebase has been tested and used by many corporations. So you kind of know that it works. With best-of-breed, a ton of code needs to be written and tested from scratch. 

This is similar to manufacturing. Which approach is smarter? Creating every single part from scratch or buying off-the-shelf? Seasoned manufacturers will advise reducing the number of variables as much as possible. And if you have access to off-the-shelf components that can be assembled, that is likely to give you less headache than creating everything from scratch.

We are going to buy every best-of-breed app in the market and integrate using the service layer (APIs). In theory, it should work, right? But, unfortunately, in reality, it's much harder to integrate using the service layer. And that's why you will hear a lot more integration issues with the company that grew through acquisitions. Whether you talk about NetSuite integration with its WMS, LogFire integration with Fusion, Infor OS, Epicor, or Aptean.

So when you hear Eric say that even the ERP vendors might run into integration challenges with their own products, he is typically referring to these issues. But the solution is not to write the integration from scratch for every single scenario.","","üëç (1)"

Even a microservices application equals a monolith from your perspective if you only have one central API to interact with it.

I mean you can use the best microservice SaaS in the world but if you have one API ingress point (even it it exceptionally well load balanced) and you do not have access to the inner message bus and services, it does not make any difference if it is a monolith or not from your perspective (given that it runs well). It all comes down to the quality of that API. You care even less if you only use its UI.

So.. to answer your question, as long as you do not have well documented access to the inner workings of the ERP, you do not have much advantage if you have a microservices approach or a monolith or anything in-between. Home grown ERP should be microservices based, or you should start to break up your legacy monolith if you have one. MS dynamics (I guess that is what you meant by Business Central) in the background is probably not a monolith, but I doubt it is a microservices architecture. My bet is on SOA.

Re: your comment about many ERP systems offering the edge and plant floor insights built-in. The smaller ones built by plant floor operators don't necessarily understand the issues bigger companies face. In my mind, they are not necessarily ERP systems. They would be more of an app.

The bigger systems take different strategies. Most of them are integrated systems that have been acquired over a period of time. So they don't necessarily mix ERP with the operations.","","üëç (1)"

Unfortunately, for manufacturing and inventory, the processes are so tightly integrated that if you kept everything outside, you will still struggle. Also, the more you keep it outside, the more expensive it gets with the integration challenges, etc. 

The easiest  way to think about this would be whether the data is used across departments or just one department. If it is cross-functional data set like customer, vendor, or inventory, then it has to go inside the ERP. Otherwise, the functional apps can keep, augment as they like, as long as they are not augmenting something that needs to be used by other departments. 

You might also end up storing some data that is purely used as a transport. For example, say  the Amazon channel requires a tracking number and the tracking number is produced by the TMS, so you might need to store the tracking number inside the ERP. Or the ERP might be completely bypassed. It might be OK to bypass ERP in certain instances if the dataset or use case is not operational or financial in nature.

- A warehouse can be created for the  field services' team to track their inventory separately, and parts can be assigned accordingly 

- a field service ticket can use related fields to reference an original manufacturing order, from where an as built bom is accessible (with serialized parts)

This may initially appear complex, but it simplifies the process and aligns with Microsoft's intended use of the platform. Store all inputs (who, what, where, when) in a table for aggregation and summarization. Establish separate related tables for common filterable objects and dimensions. Integrate these values into a common database, functioning as a data warehouse, ensuring consistent naming across sourced systems.

Assuming you have purchased Power platform resources, you can utilize Power Automate with Power BI Paginated reports (formerly SSRS) for emailing and generating PDFs on timed subscriptions. By separating concerns, you can create a Power BI analytical resource and paginated reports simultaneously, with results achievable in less than a week.

While there are concerns regarding Power Apps, Microsoft has made significant improvements. Simplify their use by delegating data transformations to an ETL or ELT process for a data warehouse. Limit user inputs to field validation and store data for downstream transformations. The Power Query and Power BI environment are designed for this analysis and reporting stage.","","üî• (1)"

Power BI excels in flexibility and data exploration for establishing KPIs. When SSRS became Power BI Paginated Reports, the main change was the ability to use Power BI models as a source instead of SQL.

In your case, emailing a fixed-format report is ideal. Creating a model that acts as a KPI originator, filterable by all dimensions in the model with a single definition, provides a strong incentive to use a Power BI model as a source for SSRS-style Power BI reports over SQL.","","üíØ (1)"

Advanced querying capabilities that enable complex filtering, aggregation, sorting, and joining multiple tables based on different conditions.

Better performance when working with large datasets or complex operations, as SQL is designed for efficient database management.

Seamless integration with various data platforms, programming languages, and tools, making it widely supported across technologies.

The ability to create stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers for better code organization, reusability, and automation.

Support for transactions and concurrency control to ensure data consistency and integrity in multi-user environments.

After establishing the database using SQL, we can then utilize Power Query in Power BI for the final data transformations, such as pivoting. In certain scenarios, Power Query's M language might have advantages over SQL, especially when dealing with unique or complex data transformation requirements.

IQMS was acquired by Dassault Systemes a few years ago. It's now called DELMIAWorks.  It's targets mid-market manufacturing where there is often a desire for consolidated solutions with less complex implementations.  There are obvious pros and cons to this.  I believe one noteworthy mention of IQMS is its quality management functionality.  Out-of-box, it's surprisingly strong in discrete and batch.  It's viewed as one of the more positive solutions in terms of getting through an audit.  I've seen some organizations migrate to other ERPs for other reasons but still leverage IQMS for quality workloads and compliance.

The solution overlap between Tulip and IQMS are small.  IQMS is a broad suite to address, at varying levels of efficacy, most functional departments (office and plant) in a manufacturing org.  Tulip is flexible tool to solve human-centric manufacturing problems.  For example, if a particular screen in IQMS was not well-suited to a particular production process or was cumbersome to use by operators, one could use Tulip as an alternative.  But, Tulip is not going to be a 1:1 substitute for an MES and definitely not for an ERP.  The target buyers for each solution are different.  They're either solving different problems or solving them very differently.

I suppose it comes down to what is the desired outcome.  Do you need a manufacturing ERP (e.g., financials, warehousing, scheduling, MES, QMS, CMMS)?  Or, do you need flexible manufacturing apps for frontline employees without the rigidity/limitations of an MES or ERP?  Or, do you need integration strategy?  Or, do you need all of these things?","","üëç (3)"

The digital maturity on the production side is so low that options could effectively be considered green field deployment. However, the business is strong and successful thanks to a great culture of lean manufacturing and continuous improvement. 
I know this question is how long is a piece of string, but really I'm just after a shortlist of options that support/integrate with a UNS style deployment to investigate further before engaging consultants such as third-stage or intellic. 
We're also in the thick of developing our digital strategy, gap analysis, process mapping, identifying low hanging fruit, etc. 
As an FYI, our manufacturing process is fairly simple in our eyes,  involves dry powder blending (BOM > WO > Materials gathered > Weighing > blending > Hopper > screw feeder > pumping > packages sealed > stored) - obviously quality control at various points. Equipment currently has no HMI or sensors - hence why I am here. We would be looking to retrofit/replace and future acquisitions will be made with OT capabilities front of mind. 

From my own research I've come up with the following list - but I'm unsure of the integration with the OT side.
MS D365 Business Central (We're a M$ shop in terms of business applications)
Odoo
Acumatica (MYOB Business Advanced here in Aus)

We're also not ruling out a best of breed solution, but would prefer to keep things as streamlined as possible.
In terms of modules shopping list as a starting point > Manufacturing (MES/MRP), QMS, Inventory/Procurement, WMS, Finance & Accounting.

There may be no escaping it, but the thing that puts me off with customizations is the additional support and complexity when it comes time to upgrade to new versions. 
This organisation had a bad experience in the past where platforms were customised and then every version update became a quote of 50 hours work to validate the customisations in the new version. 
Not sure how applicable that may be to these platforms. 
In terms of BC, how integrated is it with your shop floor? 
As one example, say we want to improve quality by validating ingredients and recording weights from scales. In BC is it possible to have your BOM items scanned in (QR/barcode), weighed, and the scale data logged/validating the BOM?

Barcode functionality is available in BC - you could look through the store to see if there is a ready made app that you could just install into BC to offer this functionality without developing it yourself. Its at a cost, but could be worth it.

It's rare with most transactional systems.  They're not event-driven.  Everything is very database-centric.  

There are some things in the ERP that are the result of human-driven transactions (e.g., creating new parts, creating new customers) and some that are automated (e.g., EDI-driven releases, requirements planning / scheduling creating Work Orders or Kanban cards).  They don't necessary need to all be continuously polled for changes.  One approach is to cache the results and refresh them on some interval based on when they might be updated.  Another approach is to update semi-frequently by default, but add additional triggers such as when a changeover event for special cases and create some limits on requests (e.g., assume no more than x changes in y time period).  It also helps if there is an endpoint that returns a snapshot of all open work orders, active workcenters, etc.  This helps aggregate the requests rather than having hundreds or thousands of assets beat up an endpoint every time they need to retrieve data.","",""

That said, the value of ISA95 is not in achieving Plug and Play. Its deeper than that. The Value of ISA95 is as an information architecture for manufacturing.

It's a mature space with well-defined industry conventions.  Some major OEMs design their supply chains around this tech.  If one is a smaller player this these supply chains, they don't really have a choice in the technology they use.  Their customer or industry may require them to.  ERPs are long lifecycle technology with a lot of inertia.  It's hard to deviate where the benefits exceed the costs.  There are existing investments in integrating EDI with ERPs.  All those documents have have been mapped to APIs or database procedures.

EDI, along with some of the domain-specific XML standards for finance and procurement (e.g., cXML), will make up the bulk of supply chain integration.  I know people have occasionally discussed company-to-company UNS here, but I would not say that's a major trend.  That's a custom approach implemented that requires alignment and specific technology know-how.  It's probably more likely to be adopted if there isn't an existing infrastructure for conducting commerce or the infrastructure does not work well for the use case.

EDI is a mature technology where it's day-to-day operation and basic support can be overseen by non-technologists (e.g., supply chain, logistics, schedulers, accounting analysts).  Even though it's primitive text files, there exist many document specs to exchange all sorts of things beyond scheduling, ordering management and shipping/receiving.  Traceability, certificate of analysis, inventory, and treasury functions come to mind.  It can do more than what most realize or their ERP supports.","","üíØ (1)"

As companies have been migrating to ERP in the cloud, there's less of a reliance on direct connections.  When an ERP is multi-tenant or it's deployment spans multiple data centers, it can be inefficient or even impossible to use direct connections.  VANs, previously seen as a way to outsource EDI for companies too small to manage it on their own, are becoming much more relevant as companies upgrade their ERPs.  Instead of hosting EDI platforms and managing secure network connections throughout their supply chain, companies are now relaying everything through VAN services to their trading partners.  All the major VANs basically peer and interconnect with each other now.  One can integrate their ERP with a single VAN and conceivably use it to trade with all their customers and suppliers.  This negates the need ofr direct connections among trading partners.

The other trend is some traditional EDI workloads are now being encapsulated and even mapped over API.  I've seen some VANs offer translation services to certain industry or OEM documents specs.  The ERP will exchange the supply chain data in some canonical XML or JSON format with the VAN.  The VAN will convert it to the specific EDI document (e.g., ContosoLtd X12 856 v4010) and exchange it with the trading partner.  This gets the end-user and ERP vendors out of the document mapping business.

Suppose a cloud ERP has dozens or even hundreds of customers that all have some of the same major customers and suppliers.  Does it really make sense as an industry to spin up many secure connections and implement a document mapping for every unique trading partner?  There are a lot of dupicative efforts with this approach.  There are massive efficiencies by having an ERP vendor build a reusable connection to the VANs of the customers/suppliers.  Like a UNS, it decouples the integration of producers and consumers of data.","",""

It's easy to complain about chaos, but it's much harder to determine where to optimize and commit to optimizing.

Mapping out the hire-to-retire, procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, etc processes on a whiteboard is hard enough.  Sometimes people can't even come to a consensus on what is the current process (""No, actually, I do it this way."").  This is why ERP sucks and is hard to do.  There exist a fair share of problems with the solutions, vendors, consultants, etc.  But, it comes down to that the processes themselves are difficult.  They can, directly or indirectly, involve a lot of people and require a pretty deep understanding of many interdependent business functions.

If you don't like the usual suspects, look elsewhere and perhaps look a little bigger.  The customer may be ""punching above their weight"" in terms of digital maturity and business processes.  For example, their revenue may look ""medium"", but their revenue-to-employee and margins may be 5x the norm.  Some orgs buy ERP because they're cheap and it's necessary.  Others buy it more strategically.  They may be more concerned with how certain business processes may impact their ability to grow.  For example, can the current A/P process and team handle 3x more volume?  Or, can we handle all the additional BOMs and SKUs at the same pace if the customer base is doubled?  Beyond this, an org may want to refine existing processes and streamline.  For example, it takes too long to close the books.  Or, operations have no reasonable feedback loop on financial performance.  The indicators of P&L or absorbed overhead arrive too late for it to make a difference.

Clunkiness becomes a factor when the ERP isn't a good fit, poorly implemented/maintained, or the user is over-reliant on limited functionality for some key processes.","",""

Businesses just don't have the resources and expertise to truly think these kinds of things through, and even the smartest external resources can't solve your business problems. It is almost like you need to start over-hiring systems thinkers 2-3 years in advance of a big ERP implementation.

An interesting alternative which I have never seen would be decoupling the processes of an ERP and doing the implementation phased over a long period (potentially years). However, the accountants don't want to deal with this on the back end so it will probably never happen.","",""

To most manufacturing ERP folks, informally, MRP is the umbrella term for scheduling materials.  Even most tiered supply chains and ISO management systems will explicitly spell out MRP, at a high level, as some sort of process to make sure the right materials are available at the right time.

MRP II is almost more of an old research term that came out of applying ""IBM era"" tech to operations.  It was discussed but not firmly adopted.  It has about as much meaning to an ERP buyer as ""cyber physical system"" or ""asset administration shell"" or ""digital twin"" do to an IIoT buyer.

Many IT functions, at least in industry, are setup to keep the lights on (e.g., keep excel running for end users) and some long term projects (e.g., lifecycle EoL stuff, integrate acquired business units).

I think another factor is that the access patterns that many external parties desire involve a complicated access control policy that may not be in place.  A lot of security models are ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù until someone spends time segmenting them into roles - which takes time.  When an IT group is under resourced and it‚Äôs not a priority among their influential stakeholders/constituents, it‚Äôs easier to say no.

I think it‚Äôs important to think about the impact of an OT user submitting a ticket requesting access to something where there exists no incumbent access pattern.  It‚Äôs probably not a standard business process or something that was budgeting/anticipated.  The receiving end of such a request may be more accustomed to troubleshooting something that was already defined.  If they have to define something new, that will require more research and effort.  It can take a lot of time to achieve compliance/security objectives, maintain business continuity, and standup services to empower others.  When IT is viewed as a cost center, it‚Äôs easier than not to orient them around a ‚Äúbest effort‚Äù service level that X% of revenue allows.  This means ‚Äúextra‚Äù projects or requests that were not budgeted/planned/approved don‚Äôt receive the attention they could.

Like a recent real-world example of mine;
A manufacturer uses a few different softwares. An accounting software and a project management software.
With the accounting software, it's only possible to register amounts of hours worked per project.
In the project management software, it's possible to break down the project into parts, and register hours on each part.
The company need to have the hours in the accounting software though, due to some laws and regulations.

I am thinking that this could be solved by the worker registering working hours in the project management software, where the project is broken down into parts. This for knowing the amount of time per operation.
The data is fetched from the project management software through the rest API into nodered, summarize so it gives the total amount of hours on the project, which is then fetched by the accounting software, and making it available in an UNS at the same time, to be ready for when the data would be needed in the future.","",""

""... hire, pay, and train employees?""
""... turn product designs into a manufacturing process?""
""... get through a certification audit for quality, environment, materials?""

Given the complexity and variety of SAP deployments, it‚Äôs not uncommon for different orgs and teams to be opinionated about the specific approach they take.

S4/HANA is more straight forward to integrate with. Perhaps due to cloud deployment models, S4 tends to see less customization on core modules. It seems like people learned their lesson that too much ‚Äúhot rodding‚Äù in ECC came with tradeoffs for integration and maintenance. It‚Äôs not too much work to expose decent intent-based endpoints over HTTP/JSON. It‚Äôs especially easy if the SAP team is using BTP to manage and curate the endpoints. 

In general, integrating with SAP is not so much a technology challenge as it is a people and process challenge. Connecting is the easy part. Finding someone who understands the underlying business process and can demonstrate the process in the UX and APIs is the hard part. At the end of the day, someone devised a process based on business requirements and elected to implement it with SAP in a certain way. That domain knowledge is important.

Check out this reference project. It includes a connection to the sandbox APIs in SAP‚Äôs training environment. It‚Äôs calling an endpoint one would encounter for obtaining maintenance order data from the SAP Plant Maintenance (PM) module.

In general, ERP and MES apps are not good at consuming telemetry data. Under the hood, they‚Äôre databases constrained by master data and application logic. Outside of some niche verticals and ecosystems, it‚Äôs rare that one‚Äôs industrial automation is designed around this. It‚Äôs even more rare that the application provider devised the right integration patterns and flexibility to accommodate all the variability and different use cases.

When I hear inquiries whether some app (e.g., ERP, MES, WMS) supports MQTT, Sparkplug, or ‚Äúcommon‚Äù OPC UA, I want to dampen the expectations by asking ‚ÄúShould it? Is this really a good idea?‚Äù

Do we really want a ‚Äúdumb‚Äù telemetry feed that forces an integration pattern? Will this limit the use cases we can accomplish? Does it require tedious configuration to setup and maintain? What is the app provider‚Äôs integration strategy? Is it some module that is ‚Äúcute‚Äù for demos and PoCs but inadequate for actual users in production with real requirements? Is it an area of competancy for the vendor and do they put resources into maintaining it? Does the ecosystem eventually bypass it and elect to build their own solutions to facilitate the transactions they need?

In other words, is it better off to flexibly invoke specific methods like ‚Äúrecord production‚Äù, ‚Äúrecord asset state change‚Äù, ‚Äúmove container‚Äù instead of relaying the value of ‚Äústs_code‚Äù or ‚Äúprt_cnt‚Äù machine tags through a rigid ingestion process in an app?","",""
