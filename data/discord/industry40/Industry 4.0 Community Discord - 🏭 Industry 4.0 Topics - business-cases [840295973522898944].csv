Often implemented model is not used in the end - for example, when you store data values in a time-series database or store in the cloud,  that information is lost.

And you are right, OPC UA is not flat and simple, you might need to clarify when somebody mentions OPC UA - do you mean Alarms/Events, History, or PubSub? For example, if you assume that every OPC UA Server would have support for PubSub, will be disappointed.
In my opinion, OPC UA Data Access is now at TRL level 9. So it is worth making data available over OPC UA - then any SCADA/HMI can access it. I see the most value of OPC UA as of today in this. And don't think that MQTT can replace OPC UA in this use case.
In my understanding, the main consumers of data from devices are SCADA/HMI applications. With IIoT, another consumer appears - cloud-based. For the latter, MQTT of course is a better choice. 
Keeping in mind that for SCADA/HMI we still need OPC UA, should we add support for the MQTT right into any device? I don't think so. For example, in my case with this embedded device: resources are limited, hard to support both OPC UA and MQTT. Independently, or OPC UA  PubSub over MQTT - does not matter, in both cases we need to load the MQTT library into RAM.
My approach is to use middleware applications like ogamma Visual Logger for OPC to receive data from OPC UA Servers and publish it to MQTT brokers. You can argue then about what the format should be - SparkPlugB, or OPC UA PubSub JSON, or something else - that is another story.","",""

I think it is possible to map/convert from MQTT to OPC UA without losing anything. like converting int16 to int64. But not possible to map OPC UA to MQTT without losing some information. Like when you convert from int64 to int16, it works only for some range of data.
It is not clear to me, in MQTT, how you configure sampling rate, and what variables/tags should be published? Is that mostly hardcoded? In OPC UA, all this can be done from the client side. And how do you configure, what broker to publish to?  MQTT assumes that there are many subscribers - how do you know, what are these subscribers interested in? And how do you control access rights - allow only some subscribers to have access to some topics? Or all these features are not required in reality by the end-users - it is OK all have the same access to the same set of data, at the same rate? 
Also, I believe MQTT introduces inevitable delays in message delivery time comparing to OPC UA. I tried to use MQTT as a transport / cloud-based relay in some proof-of-concept project, the delay was very noticeable, and ended up creating a custom broker-kind app using WebSockets as a transport.","",""

Regarding message delivery delays, are your comparing a point-to-point OPC-UA DA client server connection to an MQTT connection between two devices and linked by a broker?

Have you compared MQTT i a chain of two pairs of UA client/servers? There should be more propagation delay with UA due to the polling nature of client server: the second pair would need a publish rate twice the speed of the first pair to not delay the data.  MQTT doesn't have this issue as a publish will traverse across a string of brokers as fast as reasonably possible.

This quickly becomes apparent if you are trying to integrate data from the plant floor up through multiple levels of the Enterprise. OPC-UA's only TRL-9 solution is client server data access, which will typically add propagation delays at every level.","",""
"753688565807841492","ravil1","2021-07-29T08:23:50.9350000+08:00","I was writing about the message delivery delay issue not comparing it to OPC UA. It was in the proof-of-concept project for the new product, a kind of TCP tunneling, primarily intended to be used to connect from the local OPC UA client app to the OPC UA Server running in a remote site, behind the firewall. The idea is, there would be Agent kind apps running in both hosts, client-side and server-side, and the broker in the cloud. The client would connect to the client-side agent, as it would connect to the OPC UA Server, and the agent would redirect messages to the remote server-side agent via the Broker, and then the remote agent would send that message to the server. In the same way, the response would be returned from the server to the client.
For this application initially, I tried to use MQTT, but it was noticeable slow even when both the client and server and broker are in the local network.  When the broker was located in the cloud, it was too slow to be useable.
Then I implemented my own broker, with connections using WebSockets, and that was fast.
I think the MQTT broker does not send messages to the subscribers immediately, instead, it saves them in the queue, and then periodically sends qualifying topic messages to the subscribers. And that period can be significant I guess. I am not sure how MQTT clients communicate with the broker, probably they do poll it periodically.
In terms of the delay context as you considered, you are right that the publishing interval should be short to minimize the delay when you chain OPC UA Servers. I would not expect that there would be too many chained levels, maybe 2 or three I guess. In most cases, I think just one federating gateway server would be used.  I don't think that each enterprise level (MES, ERP) would need its own federating gateway server. I might be wrong though.","",""

I have also never made a broker for MQTT (just a simple client to learn a little more about the protocol), so I do not know the broker's internal functions in detail.

However, what we use MQTT (SpB) for and what you use OPC-UA for are possibly two very different things?
**Do you really understand the model with the Unfied NameSpace, and why do we do it?** And if so, could you demonstrate to us how you would do this with OPC-UA?

There are many usecases where OPC-UA is brilliant, but being the backbone of an IIoT structure to build a Unified NameSpace is not one of them.

I cannot claim that fully understand the unified namespace concept. I guess it is a way to represent process control data from different sources in a context, like in a  hierarchically organized way, for example, Enterprise XYZ, Plant 123, Line ABC, Unit 123, Pump A, Inlet Pressure, or something like that.
Can OPC UA be used for that? Sure, as a specification, it has everything to build such a namespace. It has an auto-discovery mechanism, the standard way to represent any informaiton model, aggregating capabilities (using gateway servers on top of lower layer servers). Also, your namespace can be not just static, it supports versioning of your address space, you can even change your address space at runtime: there are special services for that (AddNodes, AddReferences). Alarms, history - all is possible. BTW - using MQTT, how can you query historical data? Support for complex data types - yes. Authentication and authorization - yes. BTW, In MQTT, not sure how to implement authorization - probably it is not possible at all and it is the way this feature is presented as Democratized access to data. - any subscriber can access any data. Speaking of Authentication - you can do it with just username/password, tokens like OAuth, or user certificates. Or you want to transfer files - yes, you can do this too with OPC UA. Or call methods remotely - yes.","",""

In terms of scalability - of course, small embedded devices cannot handle thousands of connections. Maybe they can afford just a couple of sessions. But this problem is solved with Gateway servers. And there are available Gateway servers in the market - for example from Unified Automation. How many client connections do you need? I doubt that there are millions of clients/subscribers, maybe thousands. Should be handled by gateway servers easily. I don't see scaling of OPC UA Gateway Servers would be different than scaling of MQTT brokers.
Here I would ask - how many subscribers can MQTT brokers support? Can they support millions? 

I expect the question - then why there are no such products in the market, which can be considered as supporting UNS, based on OPC UA? I don't know.  One of the conspiracy theories I am leaning to - I guess because usually, vendors of such products are big companies. Their problem is that they all have legacy products, for asset management, other products, and they fear that new products would compete with these legacy products.","",""

For example, if you have 100 clients today, and in XXX years of the lifespan of the project it will reach 1000, you don't select product A because it supports 1 billion vs Product B which supports 10,000. I would consider them as equal in this particular case.","",""

Also, when you say billions - I guess in this case it is MQTT as a cluster, not a single instance of the broker running in a single machine.  I think they use a fleet of machines in data centers to handle this number of clients.

It is valid to choose to use whatever else is available today (for example SparkPlugB over MQTT) if that conforms with all your requirements. Why not. I think it all depends on use cases. OPC UA as correctly mentioned is verbose, can be too universal, tries to cover a wide range of use cases. If your particular use case does not have such wide requirements, there is no advantage in choosing it. No need to buy 10 tonnes truck, if all your load is below 0.5 tonnes.
Anyhow, somehow China and South Korea promoted OPC UA as a national standard. Maybe SparkPlug is too, need to check (this time it is sarcasm, sorry). It is one of the requirements for Industry 4.0 (not in general meaning, I mean European program).

You mention that the merit of a spec could be judged at the theoretical level, but I think this misses the point of the spec is to become useable products.

I understand the fascination with OPC-UA, because I was there about a year ago. It is a deep well providing many topics to learn about.  But that is also it's downfall.

I suspect if you surveyed the makeup of those writing the spec, were end-users there defining the use cases, or was it made up of OEMs creating solutions that they think the market needs? Then the question is why all these OEMs that created the standards haven't even deployed the technologies that they thought was useful?

It sounds like you haven't implemented SparkplugB yet, but are interested. If you do implement it, my only request is that you take an honest assessment at how long it takes you to incorporate into your product vs the time it took you to develop the OPC-UA side.

I've been working with Matrikon (your ole buddies) and their innovative OPC-UA product Matrikon Data Broker took years to develop and it still is not complete.

Evaluating a spec should also include how easy it is to implement to have a better chance at market adoption. For if a spec is not accepted in the market, how good can it be?

Case in point: SparkplugB was released on paper in 2016. Pub/Sub was released a only year later in 2017. For Pub/Sub MQTT being available four years, all it has to show for it are a couple SDKs. Compare to SparkplugB, which has products at every level of the automation stack.

This begs the question, why has the market accepted one and not the other, and how much of this is to be blamed by the spec?","",""

Thank you for your feedback, it is very valuable!
I agree that OPC UA is not lightweight in this meaning. Too many options often lead to confusion. I think the strength of the SparkPlug is that it covers simpler and fewer use cases, but these are most demanded. For example, relations between nodes in OPC UA can be hierarchical and others. So you potentially can look at the address space from different viewpoints. But the hierarchical is the most often used. Although OPC UA views are there, I don't know what products leverage it. Topics in SparkPlug allow you to organize data structures only hierarchically, but it is all you need in most cases. On another side, when you have complex multilevel structures, the topic might become too long. Also, I think in many cases topic parts are used as display names to show data, right? Then it will be a problem from localization to multiple languages. So I see here limitations of SparkPlug, which are thought about and resolved in OPC UA. In OPC UA, any node is addressed by its identifier, which is much shorter than the MQTT topic. There is a special request to resolve the browse path (the equivalent of MQTT Topic) to node id.","",""

I have some experience with SparkPlugB in another project, but yes, our product does not support yet it.

We have used MQTT in different scenarios from connected vehicles to IIoT and not once did we have an issue with latency related to MQTT. The projects covered a lot of different network scenarios from using private APNs going through corporate networks and then to the cloud or the other way round. In IIoT scenarios cloud connectivity both regarding throughput as well as latency can be a general issue but this is independent of the protocol (unless throughput is an issue, in which case Google Protocol Buffers as used by Sparkplug can be a big advantage). You can find a little bit older HiveMQ load test with end-to-end latency numbers here: https://www.hivemq.com/benchmark-10-million/ (spoiler: the numbers a re very good)

Regarding how MQTT works: A broker (at least any sane implementation) will send messages right away to all subscribed clients of the respective topic and the clients do not poll the server. That's what the standing MQTT/TCP connection is for. The way the messages are persisted & replicated on the broker cluster depends on the specific broker implementation and can often be configured. The typical MQTT broker is implemented event driven and multi-threaded so you should get a pretty good latency out of it.  Of course the latency will vary between broker implementations.

This typically a function of the PLC itself.  PLCs are more driven by locality, industry, tradition, existing investments, etc.  Do you actually get a choice on what PLC will be used?

I'm assuming they're using some sort of MES app with OPC-UA or Modbus TCP drivers.  If the investment and will is there, they could build a MQTT interface.  If there isn't, you could tell a white lie ""Yes, we can use OPC-UA.  Please connect to this OPC-UA Server.""  This OPC-UA Server could be an MQTT gateway.

MQTT would be perfect for this.  In fact, it's ideal if that higher-level IT system resides somewhere else across the WAN.  Assuming nodes are connected to a broker, the app would publish to topics in the hierarchy representing where those PLCs reside.  The PLCs would subscribe to those topics.  Whenever the app publishes an update of that 1400 byte payload to a topic, it will be pushed out to the PLCs.  Whatever that 1400 byte payload is, will be written to the PLC at startup and whenever it changes.  Long story short, 1400 bytes move only when 1400 bytes change.

Using OPC-UA, the IT system's client interface will likely be continuously polling tags containing that 1400 byte payload in the server(s) across all 600 PLCs.  I'm going to be a bit of a strawman now.  There are ways to manage subscriptions, but it's rarely done in practice.  Regardless of what happens to those 1400 bytes, assuming there is not a central OPC-UA server, they will get polled every 100ms (or whatever the specified scan rate is) across 600 PLCs.

With Modbus TCP, it's the same thing, but it won't be tags.  It will be registers.  That will be a non-trivial task of consistently mapping into 1400 bytes of memory across 600 PLCs.

Check out this Cirrus Link MQTT Demo video.  1,400 PLCs and 60,000 tags discovered within 15 seconds.  Beautiful things happen when traditional polling is moved to the edge.

As @trentc - 4.0 Hero LLC mentioned, a code base will have to be developed and deployed to all the devices to use the IoT protocol interface.  The interfaces will also have to be licensed on every device.

As great as it is having native IoT protocol support onboard PLCs, it does not always make things easier in practice.  Some automation companies add this in as an afterthought.  It's like they were built under the assumption that they're for a small project and a small amount of data.  They're not built as the cornerstone of connectivity.  As a result, some interfaces are rife with limitations (e.g., extensive programming required, no en masse selection, flattened structure, tag limitations).  These challenges can make using gateway with a decent native protocol driver appealing.  With automatic tag generation, anything and everything in the controller you may need becomes available.

With that said, you're lucky to be working with Beckhoff devices in this project.  You have good options for connectivity.  I'm curious to know which option will work out best.  Keep us posted.","",""

Regarding what you transmit (all values or just what changed) definitely just send what changed.  Your topic structure should mirror your individual attributes *or* you can use Sparkplug B and only transmit the changed values on NDATA or DDATA messages.

My company is looking to upgrade controls for some sample/development production lines. Historically all controls upgrades in our plants have moved to A-B and Control Logix with Wonderware HMI at the direction of I&E and Maintenance personnel. 

I would like to move toward an open source, 4.0 friendly solution like Opto 22 groov epic or similarly capable PAC technology. I have pled my case with the I&E Tech and Maint Eng, but they seem stuck on A-B and WW. 

I talked about the ease of integration, lower cost, better availability of hardware, history of Opto 22 corp, data connectivity (that we don't have at all with current systems), free training, IO lifetime warranty, etc. Nothing seems to sway them from their stance. 

These development lines are the best place to try out a new (to us) controls technology. They do not impact production. The systems are simpler with less IO and drives than production lines, so lower investment needed and less programming/development. 

Anyone have other suggestions to approach the resistance to change? Maybe some specific advantages you have seen in groov epic over A-B from a maintenance and I&E perspective? I feel like I'm screaming in a soundproof room.","","üëçüèª (1)"

Your fiend is not resisting change.
In order to change, your friend would need to agree that the view from the top of the mountain is better than the field and the stream, AND that the effort of climbing the mountain is worth it to get that gain.

Many maintenance applications using current technology run their programs based on calendar time (i.e. service 'x' every 'y' months).  Switching to IIoT would allow for use based maintenance to be done easily (i.e. service 'x' every 'y' hours system 'z' is in operation), which is usually the first case.  This would allow them to reduce the amount of work they have to do, while keeping the place running.  

The next one is prescriptive maintenance (i.e. service 'x' when variable 'y' does 'z').  This would allow them to reduce unscheduled maintenance by addressing issues before they become a big problem

After that is predictive maintenance (i.e. service 'x' when the AI tells you to), which takes prescriptive to the next level.  It requires more work, but can really help with unscheduled maintenance.

Lastly is connected predictive maintenance (i.e. service 'x' when the AI tells you it will have a minimum impact on production).  This requires connecting enterprise assets, so it can be much more involved, but it will allow for data to be used from the ERP system to determine when maintenance can be performed to have the smallest impact on the business.

Maintenance can be seen as a cost center and something that interrupts production, if a solution can be framed as addressing both of those issues, then that could be a good way to put it.  Also, to @RickBullotta 's point rip and replace is a big commitment, running something in parallel to the existing system can still be cost effective, and provide the information needed.  Can always replace later.","","üíØ (2),üëè (1)"

That being said, I'm an enterprise Architect, we are currently in the early stages of developing an Enterprise IT/OT Architecture, right now we are going through the process of defining an abstract architecture, and creating a descriptive model of the types of software solutions that fit some of those abstract components. In a lot of ways its a process of just exploring what solutions are out there so that eventually we can perform our own analysis for down selection.  Which is kind of the origin of my question above (trying to learn pro/cons of the two design patterns) 

- What are the use cases and functional requirements that you're trying to address?
`Interoperability is a big one, most of the different tools in the technology stack are owned by different stakeholders so having something that can easily scale and allow individuals to have access to the data without needing to do a lot of refactoring to the architecture is very important. `

- What are the data sources and destinations that you'll need to integrate with?
`To the point above that's actually one of the main issues with developing enterprise architecture, and the ""fun"". There are MANY different sources/destinations. We have different flavors of MES (CP, Solumina, PEO), different flavors of historian (Pi, Canary, etc). Which is actually why having dedicated abstract data model/integration is very appealing, especially when you talk about talk about scaling, imho even just having all your integrations formalized in a view like you see in the HB home page is valuable imho when talking about enterprise architecture. (You'd be surprised how large enterprises don't even know what integrations they currently have or use lol) `

- Are you looking for a cloud solution, edge solution or both?
`Right now its all Edge and On-Prem Enterprise, but I'm really pushing our team to at least think about how cloud could be used for IIoT in the future, both from an infrastructure as a service being able to do things like infrastructure as code for deployment, but also utilizing cloud services as well.`","",""

I think a lot of Low Code solutions market themselves as solutions that make things more accessible, let's be honest, software development can be expensive, especially if done the right way! So being able to give capability to a group without having to reskill that group is very attractive to get something up and running, and in a lot of use cases it makes a lot more sense. However because a lot of low code solutions are marketed in that way, I think the major use case for the company developing the product becomes the OOTB functionality, and not the ability to customize or inject your own scripts, aka the customization becomes the edge case, this can cause issues when migrating to a newer version of the tool (a lot of times the functions that are in the customization get depreciated, etc. I've also seen some companies that have ""I have a hammer syndrome"", when you have a hammer, lots of problems look like nails, and often low code solutions with customization end up trying to solve problems they were never designed to do, and would have been much better being developed/deployed in a different tech stack. (Worst case scenario I saw a Business Unit, develop their BU wide PLM system using Sharepoint, just because SP is what they had on hand).

 1. Go problem first and adapt the servant mindset, this is absolutely crucial. How can you best serve your fellow men? World is full of people who are looking easy ways to cash out so you need to have a different staring point for your thinking and work to be able to come up with any valuable solutions. So take care of the fundamentals first, then the rest comes to you. The technology today is pretty much up there to support any of the solutions you might find!

2.Study wide, systematically and deep ALL of the industries and markets, it will take you months of work, minimum. You will find that all of the easy and obvious problems are always solved on acceptable level, so ignore the obvious. Problems do not present themselves to the practitioner as givens, they must be constructed from the materials of problematic situations, which are puzzling, troubling, undesirable and uncertain.

3. Learn how to think and become exceptional. You will find very early that you don't know what to think for solving your problem, so it¬¥s the most important problem you have to solve first. Study systems thinking, it is a special tool for problem solving process and it will help you on:
- Gaining an understanding of the undesirable situation
- Identifying cause(s) of undesirability.
- Conceptualizing the problem(s)
- Conceptualizing solutions on the problem.
- Verifying that the solution has solved the problem.

let's say 1 day/machine to understand what does the machine do and what is needed from the machine and what are the machine specific requirements. 2 days/machine if this is not served on a silver tray and you have to chase down everyone. 5 more day to document the findings.  45 person-days of work. 60-120 EUR/hour depending on your country

2 days to come up with the wiring plan and where to place switches, edge devices etc. what to wire etc.
I'd say 9 person-days to do the wiring. 11 person days. 25-55 EUR / hour depending on your contry
Nice router 800 EUR x 3 = 2.400 EUR
Nice edge device 400 EUR x 20 = 8.000 EUR

We must consider their combined impact on net gross profit margins, schedule adherence, and OEE.

By developing a weighted scoring system for planning that mirrors OEE's structure (Availability, Quality, and Performance), we can more effectively assess the manufacturing process's efficiency and its relationship to profitability.

Implementing a Unified Namespace (UNS) can significantly improve communication and collaboration between different teams, such as those working on the plant floor, data analysts, and IT staff. The UNS allows engineers at the edge to establish object/schema directly, streamlining the flow of information between parties and simplifying the IT role.

With a properly implemented UNS, data analysts can communicate directly with the plant floor staff, enabling better insights and more informed decision-making. Similarly, plant floor staff can inform analysts about the data needed, making the process more efficient.

By refining the KPIs and monitoring the correlations between OEE, planning scores, and net gross profit margins, we can make more informed decisions that lead to higher profitability and overall performance.

By understanding the connections between various factors, focusing on the development of a weighted scoring system, and aligning communication with an architecture that supports roles and responsibilities, we can effectively assess manufacturing performance and its relationship to net gross profit margins while improving overall efficiency.","",""

Applying Schedule Adherence Calculation and OEE to assess planning effectiveness and its impact on results can be done practically through the following steps:

Set a Baseline: Collect historical OEE and Schedule Adherence data for a specific timeframe, such as the past year, to establish a reference point for evaluating changes in planning effectiveness and OEE.

Keep an Eye on KPIs: Consistently track OEE and Schedule Adherence, like on a monthly or quarterly basis. This will help spot trends, variations, or deviations from the baseline.

Examine the Connection Between OEE and Schedule Adherence: Analyze the correlation between the two metrics. A strong positive correlation suggests that better planning leads to improved OEE, while a weak or negative correlation might indicate other factors at play.

Investigate Fluctuations and Patterns: Identify periods with significant deviations or trends in OEE and Schedule Adherence. Determine the root causes of these variations‚Äîwhether they stem from changes in planning effectiveness, operational issues, or other factors.

Pursue Continuous Improvement: Based on your analysis, pinpoint areas for improvement in both planning and operations. Implement changes, monitor their impact on OEE and Schedule Adherence, and refine the KPIs and planning strategies as needed to optimize performance and profitability.

Measure the Impact on Profits: Compare trends in OEE and Schedule Adherence with net gross profit margins for the same period. This will help you understand whether improved planning effectiveness and OEE are driving better financial results or if other factors are affecting profitability.","",""

Set a Baseline: The manufacturer collects data on OEE and Schedule Adherence from the past year for their production lines. This baseline will serve as a reference for evaluating the efficiency of planning and operations.

Keep an Eye on KPIs: The company monitors OEE and Schedule Adherence monthly, revealing trends and fluctuations over time. They can identify periods where planning or operational issues have occurred and make adjustments accordingly.

Examine the Connection: By analyzing the correlation between OEE and Schedule Adherence, the company discovers that improved planning leads to higher OEE. This insight suggests that focusing on planning optimization can enhance operational efficiency.

Investigate Fluctuations and Patterns: The manufacturer identifies periods with significant deviations in OEE and Schedule Adherence. For example, they notice that during seasonal demand peaks, there's a decline in Schedule Adherence due to supply chain disruptions. This observation prompts them to reevaluate their supplier contracts and inventory management practices to better handle peak demand.

Pursue Continuous Improvement: Based on the analysis, the company identifies areas for improvement, such as equipment maintenance schedules, changeover times, and production planning processes. By addressing these areas, they can reduce downtime, increase capacity utilization, and balance production schedules with demand forecasts.

Measure the Impact on Profits: The company compares trends in OEE and Schedule Adherence with net gross profit margins during the same period. They observe that improved planning and higher OEE lead to better financial results. This realization prompts them to invest further in planning optimization initiatives, creating a more collaborative environment between the enterprise and operations.","",""

When considering USN, its impact on integrating any solution should not be overlooked.  In other posts, I reference Conway's law which is often stated as the one guiding rule in software architecture that hasn't changed since the '50s.  By establishing a one-to-one connection, we don't just gain technical efficiency; it overcomes a technical barrier that removes a ceiling to what organizations can adapt to socially.

Initially many IT organisations have low trust of OT. And as an OT person I can understand why. Late night changes to code by technicians, limited change control, no roll back plans.  the steps to truley have IT and OT convergence to me is 
1.  IT understand that OT are not cowboys but, are very lean and leverage the capabilities of Industrial equipment to keep going
2. OT realise that their existing practices are not up to scratch in the converged world and need to embrace IT ways of working
3.  IT understand that for OT production is king, it pays for everything,
4. OT understand that the IT concerns of Security ,change control etc have value

At that point you can have a converges IT/OT where IT and OT work closely together. Maybe two groups under a single lead. You can move to OT becoming the owners of the production related IT infrastructure, and IT manage it on their behalf.

You can then move to a place where the OT department, take owner ship of the tradition IT tasks and has Network/C&S/Cloud/Security ... expertise.  the IT department then look at all the non production IT.

This why Walker promotes the DTMA as a way to kick the door down and put a piolet in place.  There are too many actors looking for a way to put a narrative around what ever they feel they own.

Eventually, OT gets sucked in because they are the ones with experience in running, managing, a Real-Time system.  If Enterprise/IT gets their hands on it they will screw up production.  I think this is why DT has to come from the ground up, otherwise these desperate IT managers will make a mess and then blame the people who can actually do the work for the problems they created. 

The way enterprises evolve the closer you are to the top the more you are perceived as valued and ""leadership"".  As we become real-time enterprises we are allowing more decisions to be made outside of enterprise oversite.  What should be happening is that there enterprise planning should be put to test to assure that adhering to plans id producing better results, while allowing the Realtime production operations to achieve an optimal OEE score.  If the bottom line doesn't correlate to greater profits, when OEE is high the plans are well adhered to, they should be held to account.  The UNS is the enterprises path to get data to feed their analysis, forecasting, and planning tools.  They just need to move out of the way and use the data and ask for more if they lack insight.","",""

Pharma is now considered as ""Mature Industry,"" is encountering R&D challenges (Nothing in the pipe / patent going to be public) so pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from shareholders to optimize net margins and impact stock prices. Some companies, like Sanofi, set ambitious targets, such as reaching a 32.5% net margin in 5 years. To achieve these goals, they explore options like optimizing or closing manufacturing facilities, exemplified by Sandoz's approach and CDMO expansion.

To enhance manufacturing efficiency, companies conduct audits using methods like POBOS. When issues are identified ( There are enough efficient), the journey to improvement begins. Digital transformation, often through implementing MES/EBR/Industry 4.0 becomes a key strategy for streamlining processes. In the case (MES deployment 2019) of big pharma companies with over 20 plants, key drivers & metrics are focus on areas like FTE savings, time to release a batch, and getting it right the first time.

- N3uron and Ignition Edge IIoT are pretty similar in term of pricing. 
- You are right to compare them at the edge node and they are exchangeable.
- N3uron is more lightweight and do not need a designer IDE to program since everything are done in the web server.
- Ignition Edge IIoT cannot connect to a database and no API. 
- Switching to the full Ignition is 29 times the price of Ignition Edge IIoT. This is where N3uron comes in.
- Notice that we are using N3uron in the cloud and are integrating with Flutterflow and AWS services for the application development. N3uron is great for this.
- N3uron Historian is very lightweight and MongoDB is much cheaper than all SQL databases.

lightweight and efficient, suitable for small to medium-sized deployments. Can handle thousands of concurrent connections on modest hardware, but its performance plateaus as scale increases, especially when requiring high throughput or low latency across a large number of devices.

HiveMQ Community Edition:
Scalability and high availability, making it well-suited for large-scale IoT deployments.


Security

Mosquitto:
Provides basic security features such as SSL/TLS for encrypted connections and simple authentication mechanisms (username/password).

HiveMQ Community Edition:
Offers advanced security features, including SSL/TLS, X.509 client certificate authentication, and extensive authorization controls, providing robust security out of the box.

Ease of Use and Setup

Mosquitto:
Simplicity and ease of setup, 

HiveMQ Community Edition:
HiveMQ's advanced features and scalability options introduce a steeper learning curve and potentially more complex setup compared to Mosquitto.

Mosquitto:
Large, active community and extensive documentation, easier to find help and resources for troubleshooting and development.

HiveMQ Community Edition:
Also has a strong community and good documentation, provides additional resources like webinars, tutorials, and a forum. 

Use Case Suitability

Mosquitto is best suited for:
Small to medium-sized IoT projects where simplicity, minimal resource consumption, and ease of setup are priorities.

That information varies based on the persona. The key differences between a Plant manager and VP of Ops in terms of information usually has to do with granularity of the scope. For example, a Plant Manager is much more concerned with their plant, real-time information, the ""Win the Shift, Win the Day, Win the Week"" mindset. Their viewpoint is narrowed to their factory. A VP of Ops is typically more interested in Month/Quarter/Year results. Combining of Factory information with other business systems. Looking at data at a regional level, product line level, global level, etc.. 

It varies on the company, but in my experience of doing this for global manufacturers over the last 10 years. first as an end-user and now as a Consultant/Integrator, these are the things I've taken away.

DT is about getting the information in the right place so so places where that information can save money. one I love is 
- Warehouse can know the sate of order and when they need to have materials delivered, save machine downtime because of waiting for machines. 

And there is a case you can make that, without tracking metrics we don't know where we are losing time , and on average when propel start measuring theses figures reduce by this % and that would means for us a saving of~xxx per whatever.

And I think we are still saying

We are doing a PoC for a customer using the template and learning from the MES Bootcamp: üòÉ 

Outline of the customer's requirement:
- The customer just want OEE to start with
- Competitors are the out of the box OEE applications
- This means no Work Order and Scheduler required
- The machine's HMI will select the product ID and start production
- The OEE planed production time will be scheduled according to the production shift
- The customer mentioned that they liked the Unlimited tags, Unlimited client of Ignition.
- Rapid Application Building capability of Ignition and the potential to use it for SCADA and Historian is a big plus.
- The customer mentioned that the potential to use it with an SPC application is interesting for the management. So potential Sepasoft's SPC module sell.

While it would be relatively easy to just use the same setup as that of the MES Bootcamp. I am also thinking of using N3uron instead of Ignition for a potential 20% cost reduction and 32% increase in our professional services. It would be hard work converting the python scripts to JavaScript that N3uron use.
Vision to Flutterflow as well.

3rd shift wasn't running a machine at optimal rates or with large gaps in production.

Before we had history, the manager would yell at the operator to stop making excuses. This caused all sorts of problems that resulted from this tension. While no one ever dug into the real issues that were causing the downtime in the first place.

After we had history, that same manager had proof about what caused the downtime. So instead of yelling at the employee about something that wasn't their fault, they found the problem with another part of the process and resolved it.

This decreased tension between the operator and management and identified a previously unknown bottleneck in the their process.

-

More concrete is that we work with the operators, managers, and engineers to create dashboards (on top of ad hoc ones) to help them see what is and was happening in the facility. Ex, A machine was running really well last week what changed? Oh, look the temperature of the incoming products is different, someone changed a setpoint, etc.

Quite the contrary, they usually just roll their eyes and think, well here's another dumb college guy with no real understanding of what the realities are, and trust me they think ALL executives are idiots!

Many times I have been in over my head, looking at a process I was unfamiliar with, and the operators graciously helped me to understand not only the process but ways to improve it as well. 

It's crazy how far you can get by just treating other people like, well, people...","","üíØ (4),‚ù§Ô∏è (4)"

As a former management consultant I know one of my tricks was to just talk to operators about what was happening  in a manufacturing facility. My senior client would often be amazed at the ""insights"" I brought! When I pointed out that these insights weren't mine, they couldn't believe that their operators held such knowledge. Sure I've also encountered lazy, unmotivated and hostile operators - but that was more the exception than the rule.

For a dairy example, consider when a raw milk truck arrives and receives a lot number, allowing for the traceability of all milk particulars. This milk is then pumped into a milk silo, generating a transaction record where Tanker X is logged as contributing to Batch 1A in Raw Milk Silo 1. The next step is pasteurization: the milk is transferred from Raw Milk Silo 1 to Pasteurized Milk Silo 1, creating a new transaction record for Batch 2A, derived from Batch 1A. This allows us to trace back to the original silo, and the milk tanker and includes details about the pasteurization process.

When a second tanker arrives, it is also pumped into Silo 1, initiating another transaction record and forming a new batch in Raw Milk Silo 1, named Batch 1B, which includes contributions from both Batch 1A and Truck 2. This leads to a new transaction at the pasteurizer, resulting in Batch 2B in the Pasteurized Milk Silo, which now comprises both Raw Milk Batches 1A and 1B.

Before pumping Batch 1B into the Silo, the milk was separated into skim and cream, generating two transaction records, 3A and 4A. The arrival of the second tanker triggered additional transaction records, updating the batches in the Skim and Cream tanks to 3B and 4B.

To manage this data, I would have used a separate table for each tank to log batches and associated transactions. Each transaction point should have a table listing the transaction number and the source and destination batches. This setup facilitates constructing a batch report, tracing each final batch back to all parent batches via the transaction records.

Given the complexity and potential for multiple routes, reworks, or reprocessing within larger systems, managing a single table can become challenging","",""

@Zack Scriven I think I am violently agreeing with you here but, my take on it is.

in a services business most of your costs are labour hours. I allocate about 2.5k for everything else each month, light heat, microsoft licence, chat GPT.

I don't think there is much to gain by splitting that out amongst clients and trying to track how much I use in Chat GPT for Client A v's Client B. Allocating a flat 15 and hour covers me well enough.

So looking at manufacturing I think that table is really good but I don't think you gain more insight as you move up it.

My best guesstimate of the average cost for a manufacture would be in this sort of order

Material                         35%
Direct Labour                25%
Indirect Materials          15%
Indirect Labour              10%
Allocated Non Labour    8% ( this could be a lot higher with energy, or imagine the marketing budget if we hire Beyonce and take out Superbowl ads)
Allocated Labour           7%


So it is well know how to track the direct and indirect material usage, and direct labour, and some allocated non-labour costs, like Energy you might be able to break out so that it can be come a direct or indirect cost,. and putting in the marketing spend for a product might be a good idea, and easy to define too

 but when you know about 80%+ of the costs, It will probably become harder to break out and maybe not even worth it","",""

We claimed that we saved the site 1 olympic sized swimming pool of water per shift just by monitoring the water consumption. The actual savings came from the site manager telling the shift leaders that they could not go home at the end of their shift unless the water usage was reading 0.
Making the water and power consumption visible is an easy first step. Adding context by combining data together for better KPIS and forecasting is a great second step.
All of this can be done with basic reporting tools, but soon enough you reach the limits of the source data. A classic example is ""My machine operator forgets to click on a button to complete the production order before they go home, so the night shift, which should have been non-scheduled idle time, is showing as a production delay""
Once you go past the early low-hanging fruit, the solutions become more complex. You need more context, but you also need a system capable of being a transactional source system, not just a reporting tool. That's when you need something like a Manufacturing Data Hub","","üíØ (1)"

I have done a bunch of theses, and it depends on how automated you Warehouse and plant in gneral is but if you

- Record the boxes as they are deliveries, so if a box of 500 50mm O-rings are delivered, those are scanned and move from Warehouse to the Work Cell
- as Units are produced, you know from the Bom how much of each unit is consumes and you allocate that.
- if you can record waste great, but that might be hard to do, especially if you have lots of parts added in a cell but maybe a waste bin on a scales for each part. Or the waste goes in a box and is counted at the end of each WO and shift and recorded by the Operator
-When a box is emptied, that gets recorded at the Operator station again a barcode scanner can be great here,

Input Scans less the no of units produced gives you a rough WIP number and you can use that to predict when the warehouse needs to deliver more. that rough number might be good enough for what you need.

for the ERP you really want the Operator to account for the amount of input parts that have gone into scrap. Or you could calculate that by scanning the empty boxes and Expected no - actual number produced = Scrap

Some if the improvement is just needing to do a small count at the end of each shift, instead of a big count every two weeks","",""

Or the Assemble company needs to change the work practice to never return anything to the ware house. (that may be difficult)

but certainly I have seen system where operators , check in goods received and then when returning goods they would record the amount they are returning. 

I have done that  a lot where you would be using say 100l of a 250l Drum so you would put the rum on the scales, and using a GUE print a return label that woudl say 150l left in this barrel of product X the warehouse can scan that in then.

I would recommend somethgn similar. 
 - Ware house ships a box with a barcode that has the product code and the no of units. 
- Operators scans barcode as part of work flow, 

When returning product, you use a GUI to drive a work flow
1- Select return product (pushbutton on main Screen)
2- int he return product screen you select the Product from a droop down( based on the products that have been put into the cell)
3- Enter the number of units in the return
3- print the label

now the ware house has a label telling them 200 out of a box of 1000 O-rings was returned. so they can credit the assembly 200 from the next box.

and the assembley has a record of getting 1000, and returning 200. so it will need to pay for 800


you can track the usage as you go too and match the 800 O-Ring to the 395 products and assuming 2 O-Rings per product 10 were waste

Depending on what you need you might want to use the weight, rather than counting 200 Orings


Lots of ways to doit, but labels priunters and barcode scanner wil make life much easier","",""

They have built pipelines to support a wide variety of uses cases involving AGV, AMR, LGV, and other material handling assets. Vendors of these assets include JBT, E80, Gideon Brothers, etc. It's not uncommon for users to have multiple vendor solutions within the same site. And for each vendor, there is variability across models and model generations. Each will expose data over different interfaces or with different payloads.

These material handling use cases are interesting because it requires integrating with both the assets and their management software to get the full picture. The assets have telemetry data about their location, health, current task, etc. The management software, often with a SQL backend, have the information about intent and operational context of those assets. This is where all the data for the tasks, material, locations, etc reside.

Some use case patterns:
-Consistent data models across assets to support a unified view of vehicle status, inventory status, order status, batteries, chargers, dispatch, what's blocked, what's waiting, etc.
-Send run hours and open work orders in maintenance platforms (Infor MP2, Infor EAM). 
-Publish contextualized activity data to historians (AVEVA PI System) and data warehouses (Amazon Redshift). 
-Send program backups, log data, and detailed faults to storage (Amazon S3). 
-Create alerts for notification system if an asset has gone offline or is ""stuck"". 
-Share data between management platforms
-Share location data to prevent interference and conflicts

One of the more clever use cases I've seen involved the REST Data Server. There was a use case that required sharing location data between two different vendor platforms.

Break down the payload into individual attributes and determine where that data will come from in the material handling data sources. Try it with one group of similar assets and then another.

I've been building the buisness case that there is investment needed in the prerequisites before we can take advantage of AI tools -  we need well structured physical network, we need to be collecting good quality data from the edge, the data needs to be made consumable and needs to follow standards...  

Then some salesman comes along trying to sell some AI tool as if it's a panacea.  It's like a car salesman selling a car to someone without a license.

I always felt the consulting industry was a predatory industry targeting execs and private equity.  Now it seems like AI vendors are the new version of this.   And I'm by no means an AI skeptic, I just know we have a lot of work needed to be able to reap its' benefit.","",""

How is the business organized and what is a logical way for users to browse/filter data? Where are they consuming data and are there any infrastructure constraints impacting them (e.g., network latency, WAN reliablity)? What apps/services are they going to use to consume this data? Is it a trend of values? Is it dataset for a particular business function? Are there any metrics that need to be calculated from data sets?

Work backwards to datasets that the above will depend on. This is your data at rest. This data could be stored in a relational database, a time series database, a historian, a datalake, a data warehouse, etc. Use what you already have and/or what is conducive to meeting the needs above. If you have a lot of process telemetry data that engineers to explore, trend, and analyze, a time series database or historian might work. If operations wants information about tracking discrete products, a relational database can make sense. The schema in these data stores are the semantics of your UNS. They should align with organizational requirements above.

Work backwards to what it takes to get data into these data stores. This is your data in motion. You could optionally employ a message broker to relay the latest values for data consumers that need it in a pub/sub fashion. Most consuming nodes about L2 will not.","","üëç (2)"
