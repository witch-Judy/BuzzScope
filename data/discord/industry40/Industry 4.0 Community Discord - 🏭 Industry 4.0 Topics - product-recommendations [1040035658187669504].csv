Can the ctrlX platform be managed completely remotely? 
**Yes there is a device management in place which allows security updates, software updates, backup and restore and remote connection.

How real time is the realtime IO? Is there support for CAN or serial based protocols like profibus, devicenet, CANopen ? 
*Realtime IO depands on the EtherCAT fieldbus cycle time, it's 1 ms for ctrlX CORE X3 and with the faster ctrlX CORE X7 even faster. There is a support of Profinet. CAN is currently only supported via CANope USB adapter or via EtherCAT CoE profile.

Can we import our own Python libraries? 
*Yes, you will need to compile them within your own snap container (container format of the platform).

How does it perform in AI/ML heavy applications? 
*ctrlX CORE X3 (ARM-based) can execute models, ctrlX CORE X7 (Intel i7 based) can calculate more AI stuff. But there is an additional Hailo-based accelator module possible for AI calculations.

Can we run ctrlX os on our own hardware?
*It is planned to run ctrlX OS on third party hardware. Currently Bosch Rexroth is in a evaluation phase with several device manufacturers.

Can we run a small database on the core?
*Yes, there is the InfluxDB app available. Check this how-to:

But digging in and comparing the details, I disagree...

Most of the other solutions don't make it easier to make the tools function together as if they are one, and most times it's hard to tell that they are all running on the same platform. The primary benefit of many is that you can run it on the same hardware, but you still have to integrate as if they were completely separate and not intended to work together.
They very well could be running on separate systems, its not much different to integrate either way on these solutions.

The way it is all packaged to be more uniform instead of acting like each piece is totally separate is a differentiator. It starts as a blank slate with only platform configuration, then you go to the store to install apps like you would your smartphone. The functions, features, configuration and programming provided by the apps are all brought into a common web UI.  Managed, deployed, backed up, and restored as one solution.
 
The combination of Realtime IO and event based data on a common data layer makes it a powerful combination of controls, data management, and connectivity. Every app can have access to this data layer, for example there are Node-red nodes to publish/subscribe to data here, as well as in the codesys based ""engineering"" programming IDE the code can access realtime IO, or the event based data layer. This is also true for the IDE app that lets you program in blockly, python, javascript.","","üëçüèº (3),üíØ (2)"

2. What is the physical PLC interface? Serial, ethernet? what protocols?
3. Identify how to read/write data from the PLC with Node-Red....
      Can I find a node that will do this?
      How to use the node and Does the node even work?
4. oh wait I gotta do that with python too!
      Which libraries do I need to do this?
      How to use the library, and does it even work?
5. Ok now I have everything to read data into my node-red and python....
6. Wait, now I want data from python in node-red....
7. Figure out combination of nodes and libraries that allows python and node red data exchange 
8. Ok, now I can develop
9. Boy, I hope no-one asks me how this works, or tries to figure it out after me.....hehe


With the unified platform like ctrlX...
1. Install ctrlX core and get it connected to the internet.
2. Install from the app store, PLC, node-red, python RT, and IDE
3. Now I'm ready to develop.
4. All necessary integration between apps is done through already included libraries
5. All apps are managed centrally in a common UI, able to see apps installed, applications that are running and even a data layer explorer to see the data on the shared data bus.

The time and effort it takes to get actually developing is so much shorter...and ability to manage it by others is no comparison.

Other implementations are between these 2, like Opto22, and a step closer is PLCNext.","","üëçüèº (1)"

- The EtherCAT performance sounds like it meets my expectations and beyond.
- I'd imagine we can solve the serial and can protocol connectivity with some combination of the tools/apps available, its a matter of the physical interface.
- It would be nice if I could just include my own python libraries in the IDE app instead of having to create my own container, but good to know there is a solution.
- I'm glad to see an AI acceleration module, as I believe AI/ML at the edge/on machine is increasing in demand.

Don't get me wrong, I like what Bosch Rexroth has done.  I'm just not get convinced it's miles ahead of everyone else.

I'm also biased towards not getting  HMI and IIoT software from my PLC/control vendor because I'm most accustomed to very heterogenous control environments where it is necessary to integrate stuff from multiple vendors, OEMs, etc.

All live data updates are sent on one topic (DDATA) whether you want it or not (on mass this could add significant unwanted load to a network, especially when considering varying frequency rates of data). For example: if I have an application and I want 1 data tag from a device which has 100 data tags, using the sparkplug protocol, I have to receive all 100 data tag updates from the device.

2. depending on the rate of change, the use of DBirth could lead to stale data for listeners which were not connected at the time of the DData update, as such, if the rate of change of the data point is low and the DBirth is not updated regularly, stale data will be present in the system for new connection (this is overcome in basic MQTT, when previous data is retained and can be referenced per topic).

3. Data compression (specifically Google Protocol Buffer) can be a barrier to entry for simple application listeners. While its need is evident in large systems, especially Edge Node to Edge Node, for simple devices / applications this added layer of complexity can block the free flow of information in MQTT networks.","","üíØ (1),üëç (1)"

Although, regarding point number 2, the design of Sparkplug is that when a node joins and starts receiving NDATA or DDATA for something it hasn't received a NBIRTH or DBIRTH, it should send an NCMD/DCMD to that node requesting it republish the NBIRTH/DBIRTH.

This solves the problem your have in mind about missing the state of data, but reveals other problems, such as requiring a command path from anywhere in the Enterprise to the Sparkplug node (which may not be desirable, especially if the device is on the plant floor and it should not have any inbound paths. Also, if there are a thousand nodes, then that could be a thousand BIRTH requests coming in, which the device may or may not be able to handle.","",""

1. The negative effect of Industry 4.0, in which data interoperability is being restricted for monetary reasons. In the past aligning to protocols was a means of better market adoption and integration, and now we are faced with high costs for simple data access, which absolutely limits scalability regardless of what protocol is in place.
2. Low-code and No-code becoming a deciding factor for engineers, which is in-line with your statement regarding ‚Äúmaking the integration of data consumer applications painless‚Äù, however I believe this is more prevalent than realized, as engineers seek quick ways to move data from A to B without realizing the negative effects of the decisions made. For example, the issues I/we raised with Sparkplug, which is useful in the right situations, but not everywhere, especially not on scale for all IT / OT interoperability.
3. Good Marketing versus reality, history has taught us that the best technology is not always the most popular, especially not immediately, I draw reference between the rivalry of Edison and Tesla with DC and AC power transmission. Sometimes the popular vote is misleading, which inherently will slow down technology development, which in this case would be achieving truly interoperable manufacturing systems.
4. Automation of Device Gateways which currently is currently poorly implemented / limited, could be a serious gamechanger for heterogeneous manufacturing system communication. While we wait to see if one medium of industrial communication and data modeling can become a reality, the automation of varied system integration and master data alignment is possible. Scaling system integration could be as easy as adding a new row to a database while automation / validation scripts take care of the rest.","","üëç (3)"
"1055524422280302703","jeffmorgan.555","2022-12-30T23:46:14.3800000+08:00","Personally, my favorite part of MQTT is its data agnostic capabilities. Even if some systems in my network will use sparkplug, it wont effect other networks I have using the same broker which are not. This flexibility has been key for me with the expanding requirements of smart factories. In contrast OPC UA maybe robust and detailed, I have found it to also be at times convoluted. Future factories will not always have same staff capable of maintaining such complex specifications. I believe you have covered this well in your article in relation to the alignment in OPC UA services between different vendors. However, I am not sure what will prevail in the end, as mentioned in your article and the points above, the matter is complex. Right now I personally am not looking for ‚Äúone protocol to rule them all‚Äù, but I am looking for insight in where to use what protocol, and methods to ease integration, scale, and cost.

You can use Grafana to create nice dashboard for yout prometheus data. This is monitoring. I am not sure what you mean by managing the server.

If you want your data from OPC UA Servers to be published in UNS in minutes - please consider using our product.

Version 3.0.0 of our flagship product - ogamma Visual Logger for OPC has been released!
With it, you can start collecting data from OPC UA Servers and store & forward it to the cloud or in-prem databases in minutes. No need to manually browse OPC UA Server address space, neither drug nor drop nor edit configuration files manually. Just define your variables' browsing and selection logic in Python scripts - and the rest will be done in a minute. For example, MQTT topics can be composed automatically particularly using variables' browse paths.
If you would like to have historical data too - with it you can also log your data to InfluxDB, or Kafka, or SQL databases.
The product can be supplied either as software only, or we can ship it to you pre-installed on an industrial PC. In the latter case, there is an option to maintain the OS and application completely remotely at the fleet level.

In this video, end-to-end data flow from the OPC UA Server to the HiveMQ broker running in the cloud is demonstrated: https://youtu.be/MLfYwUlTGLA","","üëç (2)"

If you decide to use NodeRed or HighByte, you will have the same problem. Or rather one more configuration step.
This proposal is for use cases when data is available over OPC UA according to the customer's design or real situation, and now they want to move it without spending too much time and resources.
This is a good note that if we want to go further and automatically discover all servers and automatically connect to them, to make the connection part to work you will need to solve problem of certificates trust. The simplest way for that to configure trust for each connection manually, which can take a few more minutes, not hours, if you know what you are doing.  Or to use certificates signed by CA and set up trust to these well-known CA certificates. Open source GDS can be used for that, or generic  certificate management solution.

One of the finest not-so-known UNS is Manufacturing Data Engine (Google's product). They never marketed as UNS.

1. It includes GCP Pubsub -> Cloudscale ingress layer. Pay as you go and scales nicely with unbeatable SLA.  You can scale millions of msgs/second and it won't break.
2. GCP flow -> translating multiple data format (including Litmus Edge JSON) to 1 standardized format and it is configurable. It also creates Hierarchy + UNS type layout.
3. GCP Bigquery + Bigtable -> instant push into DB for various analytics 
4. Looker -> Build your own apps / BI 

Yes if you plan to stay in GCP ecosystem, this is a slam dunk.

For Local UNS + Bridging 
1. Manufacturing Connect Edge (Litmus Edge) on OT layer -> Manufacturing Connect Edge (Litmus Edge) on IT layer via using NATS Proxy protocol. 
2. Use the built-in MQTT brokers in MC and scale it up 

If you are considering UNS at Scale, please do get in touch with GCP/Litmus team.","","üíØ (1),üëå (1)"

i need a HMI recommendation
We are looking to add an gui to operator station that will controls few of factory equipment. We have a mix of GE and AB PLCs. Currently we have a Proficy Cimplicity that seems overkill for the application that we have, and with not so good product support we are looking to move away from it

Two of the major requirement for our new HMI is to
- have its own inbuilt operating system such that if the hmi breaks, we replace it by just using another unit from our spares and its ready to go
( we have had a lot of issues in past where when our current system broke down we would have to get IT involved, takes forever to get the right windows settings that are compliant with all policies and what not, losing valuable production time)
- has a decent historian data storage and view as regulations need us to store upto 30days of data on the operator station itself. taht historical data needs to be available even if their is network outage (overall network is segregated and current HMI and about 7-8 foundry equipment sit in one area, on one VLAN such that when netwrok is up and running they talk to main historian server, but are also capable of running if for any reason the network goes down)

We looked at Panelview but decided against it as it needs kepware to talk to GE PLCs
looked at Ignition/Aveva hmis, but not going for that as we still have get IT involved in getting a pc configured for these. I thought about Ignition Edge but there is a limit on how many devices you can connect, plus for GE PLCs i need kepware.. 

any suggestions?","",""

Michael Walker
Specifically answering the Ignition ""From Scratch"" portion of the post. Look at the Systems Integration community who work with Ignition, that build MES ""software kits"",  ""accelerators"" or ""frameworks"" in general outside of Sepasoft module(s).  
 
Intellic has an MES that we generally start with to quickly deploy projects. 
 
Some other integrators are using Kanoa MES, or Spark as linked below. 
 
https://kanoa.ai/kanoa-mes-overview
 
https://www.flexwareinnovation.com/spark-mes/ 
 
Each of these systems are installed openly on Ignition AFAIK, from there you get MES functionality quickly, but then are in an open platform (Ignition) to continue expanding on use cases, feature development, customization, etc...   This is my mind is the best of both worlds (CUSTOM vs COTS)

It‚Äôs been true to itself pre-acquisition because it‚Äôs not really a core module that in phase 1 implementations.  It tends to be adopted if customers desire to consolidate their solutions or they don‚Äôt really have a strong incumbent CMMS.  Most of it was developed for specific SMB customers 10+ years ago.  Some of procurement integration for supplies/spares is kind of neat.  It‚Äôs also nice how the work requests can be reviewed and opened from the shop floor MES screen.  It provides a way to integrate frequent PM (e.g., daily, shift) into production.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Plex for CMMS unless Plex is already in the architecture and the maintenance program is not very sophisticated.

Plex overall has remained relatively ‚Äúindependent‚Äù post-acquisition because the product and engineering leadership largely took over Rockwell‚Äôs software business units.  Before this, Rockwell didn‚Äôt really do SaaS or services.

The bigger issue is that, for quite a while, Plex have not really kept pace as the platform and architecture has aged.  They‚Äôre going on 10 years now of a new UX project with a significant share of their legacy install base still on classic.  Major enhancements only really happen for securing large customers or getting their implementations across the finish line.  They have had a poor track record in recent years keeping up with delivery of a compliance functionality (e.g., USMCA customs, AIAG+VDA FMEA v5, Foundation FMEA).

Plex is just at a mature investment stage.  It‚Äôs two things at this point.  First, it‚Äôs recurring revenue among a customer base in which it‚Äôs too costly to switch.  Second, there is still untapped market of manufacturers with legacy ERP/MES or nothing at all.  To these organizations, anything is an improvement over what they have.  Accelerated road map delivery and aggressive refactors are not in the works.","",""

If the interfaces aren‚Äôt catered to the task at hand and they‚Äôre inefficient, it‚Äôs a disaster.  CMMS/EAMs become easily become red tape rather than a productive tool if they‚Äôre not deployed properly

Tulip could be really useful for maintenance activity.  It would be an amazing interface for maintenance technicians.  The problem is that it doesn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúMDM‚Äù backbone necessary for a major maintenance program.  I don‚Äôt know how it could handle scheduling, supplies / procurement integration, and asset BOMs.  For example, a plant can have like hundreds or thousands of pumps with lots of variations.  A good PM solution would allow to define base level activity with additional activity for the variability.  It then must be associated with assets and then scheduled (e.g., by frequency, by time, by condition).  It would be cumbersome to build all of this out from a front interface.  It needs a back end data model with a set of logic to orchestrate everything.  Imagine if PM content relevant to all pumps needs to be revised or added.  That could entail updating hundreds of pump records and thousands of scheduled maintenance orders.

On the other side of the coin, while they have better management features, the user interface of many CMMS is not great.","",""

There is no HMI component to Kepware so its more of a single source for all your machine connections. there is data logger and historian plugin as well.

The Manufacturing Suite is a great offering.  It can connect to a lot of stuff.

If you're interested in report-by-exception, you're better off using OPC UA Server interface with subscriptions.  The IoT Gateway (with MQTT and REST Client) is kind of clunky as there isn't much control over the payload.  It doesn't support Sparkplug.

Each asset may have its own capability to directly provide data or it may do so indirectly through its own dedicated gateway.  Another way to think of this is like smart, connected products.  It's lots of distributed nodes.  In manufacturing plants, often, the data sources are aggregated into one or few interfaces such as an OPC Server, Historian, SCADA, gateway, etc.  What the consuming client may connect to might actually have hundreds or thousands of devices behind it.

Some data acqusition technology is well-suited to working with small amounts of data from many data sources, but it does poorly at dealing with very large amounts of data from fewer sources.  This is what the cloud service providers really struggled with when they first got into IIoT.  They thought it was like IoT scenarios where it would be like connected products or fleet management.  They didn't realize that they wouldn't be connecting to or putting their edge runtime on every machine, but instead some gateway that aggregates the namespace.

In the most simple way, working with the data of one node is very different than working with all the nodes in a factory.

OPC UA Servers often have two primary messaging modes: polling or subscriptions.  Polling is when the client retrieves data from the server on an interval.  With subscriptions, the client will subscribe to the tags in the server and the server will publish the values when they update.","","üíØ (1),üëç (1)"

Relational databases are oriented around certain transactional qualities.  These qualities are desirable and relevant for working with, say, ERP or MES records.  These qualities are not as relevant for handling time series data from OT telemetry.  The Ignition tag historian relies on a conventional relational database.  All the timestamps, tags, values, and datatypes are stored in single, massive table.  This table is partitioned and compressed.

While partitioning and compression can help with performance in some cases, it can have scalability issues and can be less performant in other cases.  It can be inefficient for a database to filter rows across many partitions and run aggregate calculations.  From end user perspective, there may be long query executions or timeouts.  Outside of the SCADA or OT world, it's not uncommon to replicate relational data into an alternative data structure or database technology to better handling analytical workloads.  What is optimal for applications may not necessarily be optimal for analysis.  What is optimal for applications may not necessarily be optimal for telemetry.

If you are all about Ignition and you're not observing issues, continue using Ignition.  These nuances about databases and historians may be less relevant to your projects and applications of the tag historian module.  Using @Ted Garrison's experience with the module as an example, it's more relevant.  Your mileage will vary.

Gotcha. I see. At my current company we are not that large yet to run into any long timeouts. 

My question was probably not worded well. Everything is fine using the Ignition tag historian at the moment, I'm trying to figure out what's the actual need of a historian.

Right now if there is a need to look at historical data, usually from an incident, we look at the wide tables (snapshots of all data from a piece of equipment) rather than data stored in the historian. 

Also, since I'm decent at Sql, I'm able to run queries against the data in the wide tables and get great results. 

I think I may need actual examples of how the historian can be more useful than interval snapshot logging.","",""

Sometimes it's many individual data streams published, independently of each other, on change or some unique interval.  This is the primary way batch and process industries think about data.  Think of big assets with tons of instrumentation that is always logged.  The users might be more concerned with monitoring and studying long trends in data.  For example, the precise change in the level of a tank over time might be more important than whether tank is at/near a full or empty state.  This where one might use a traditional historian or time series database.  This is where one might have one giant or many ""narrow"" tables.

Other times, it's an event consisting of a collection of many data points at a very specific time.  This is a more common way discrete manufacturers think about data.  As widgets come off the line or alarms happen, they may want to consume data more like a report or a snapshot of the operation/process.  For example, they may want to log the traceability of a complex assembly and how its bill of materials were consumed.  They may be more concerned with quickly resolving an alarm state, a stoppage, or a nonconforming process.  The position of a robot when it mishandles something and what it's handling (e.g., serial no, lot) may be more useful than the robot's positions before or after the mishandling event.  This is where one might log in ""wide"" tables in a database.

These scenarios can, of course, be blended across industries.  The discrete people might want to closely monitor the conditions of a critical asset over time.  The process people might need to log some reason code when a process is unexpectedly interupted.  But, what is being produced and how its produced, will largely drive how people think about industrial data.","",""

I'm currently working on a project where I need to integrate stack lights (andon lights) into an MQTT namespace. Ideally I'd like to find stack lights that can be connected with as minimal middleware as possible. Direct MQTT compatibility would be ideal. And importantly, without being tied down to proprietary software layers from the stack light vendors. 

I've developed a prototype using relays, Node-RED, a Raspberry Pi, and a StreamDeck board. Now I'm looking on how to upgrade this into a production ready system.

I'm aiming for a setup that's as open and flexible as possible. Does anyone have experience with stack lights that fit these criteria?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1040035658187669504/1209092717884473375/image.png?ex=68df0497&is=68ddb317&hm=35720c171b6c2e9e34b6ce5e286315b53252f38b4f8c6464cfb7fd334e53b30d&",""

But, in order to get the most of tableau it needs to be sitting on a data warehouse or have something like Alteryx for ETL.  Some of the transformations, especially when working with industrial data, can be too much to do in a BI solution.

If you're going through billions of rows, it might be worthwhile exploring an OLAP schema (e.g., stars, cubes).  Another option is to explore a column-oriented database (e.g., AWS Redshift, SQL Server w/ Columnstore).  This can help improve performance on those big aggregate calculations.

If you're comfortable with SQL, Snowflake is a joy.  It's very flexible.  It takes a lot of headaches out managing databases and compute.  I've heard there exist some partner solutions for no code / low code transformations.  In addition to bringing your preferred BI solutions, there are also a lot of interesting solutions for building visualizations and data apps such as Streamlit.

If you're an MS shop and there is already a team in place that is supporting [and funding] Azure, this might make sense to use.  The only concern I would have is some of the changes they've made to their services and strategy in recent years.  Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Fabric, Azure OneLake, etc.  It would be nice to see more stability and continuity.  They just seem to be all over the place.

as we moved to Thin Client Architectures we became more sophisticated, but as I moved to the Client side, and then to consult, I was amazed at the number of integrators, who never considered that redundancy might be important. 
Especially when it is an embedded feature of the software they were developing on.

And when they tried to fall back on HA servers, there was always data loss.

I do wonder where this line between IT and OT should be drawn.  Any suggestions on modifying my definition above to clarify?

Considering the Purdue Model, where would you draw the line between OT and IT?

Relays control power
Remote IO blocks control the Relays
PLCs control the IO Blocks
SCADA/HMI control the PLCs
MES controls the SCADA
ERP controls the MES

It's all on a spectrum, and the further away from direct manipulation of the physical world, the harder it is to call OT.

Getting a bit philosophical, however: ERP (functions) is a first cause for OT, since without sales/inventory/distribution there is no foundation/justification to be controlling the physical world to begin with.","",""

I would consider ERP decoupled from OT because it does not directly impact the world. Traditionally that decoupling was paper.
A SCADA on the other hand , press a button and stuff happens ,

MES was the battleground, because I think philosophically the function is execution. But because the skills tended to be from the IT realm( Databases, API and all that stuff which was beyond  many a controls engineer even 10/15 years ago. 

and I think when IT/OT convergence started, it progressed as IT Eating OT and trying to make it conform to IT approaches and ITSM. There are lots of good ideas we can take from ITSM but I prefer to create an OTSM approach.

And I think now the battle for MES is swinging and OT departments have learned the skills, and are taking over.
Maybe ERP will follow, because as the ERP is integrated more into the plant floor, a change in the ERP could cause recipe changes, or automatic starts for Jobs etc.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1040035658187669504/1217452467009097789/image.png?ex=68df1bb7&is=68ddca37&hm=8a5041499dc61d286d1f7695bf1732e71d612f985c0709f56e7cd2a79a8bb6fa&",""

But the supporting operations is key. 
Ithink if it has a direct impact on Operations it is OT. 

If the ERP is down and I cannot add an order, I will probably be able to add it in later and there will be no impact on the plant floor.
with a POS terminal, if it is down, I cannot order now and production is impacted immediately.

But that sort of becomes a spectrum. 
Switch off a PLC, -> Line Stops
Switch off a SCADA/HMI -> Machine might keep running for some minutes, typically there will be some stoppage or failure and you cannot restart
Switch off a MES   ->  Machine might run for a few hours you can probably finish the order, but you might have an issue restarting downtime or managing rejects
Switch off a ERP ->  you can probably keep production going for a day or two. might even stretch to a week.

If the ERP is so tightly integrated that the plant will stop in less than an hour, I would say it has crossed into OT. 

of course you lose functionality, and you might not collect data or information , but that is a sperate question","","üëçüèº (1)"

1) Viewing Things as only properties misses out on a lot of the power and capability of ThingWorx.  A thing is properties, events, services (functions) and subscriptions.  Also, any of these can be attached to Thing Templates as well
2) Mashups can be modularized as well (e.g. mashups can contain other reusable, templated mashups).  As an example, you can create a mashup that is for submersible pumps, in your example, and that can be reused and linked dynamically to any instance. Somewhat like faceplates in the SCADA/HMI world
3) There are ""flows"" (workflows) but the more valuable stuff is often the subscriptions and services the implement business logic.  ThingWorx is inherentely event driven in this regard.  
4) There can actually be multiple ""databases"" for ThingWorx.  You can specify different ""providers"" for different types of data - configuration data, structured data, unstructured/textual data, and time series data (e.g. you can use SQL Server for some stuff and Influx for others)
5) ThingWorx APIs are bi-directional and provide the ability to read and write property data, read and configure metadata/models, read and write historical data and events, execute Thing services, and so on
6) There are extensibility SDKs to let you build custom inbound or outbound connectors and to create custom widgets
7) Without overcomplicating it, there is also a construct called a ""Thing Shape"" which can add capabilities to Things and Thing Templates.  As an example, if you had thing templates for filling machines, labeling machines, packing machines, and palletizing machines, you could also have a Thing 'shape' for OEE that you could attach to those template to add OEE calculation and visualizations in a much more maintainable way.
8) You probably shouldn't go directly to the database for BI purposes.","",""

New version 1.1.0 of the OPC UA Forge ( https://onewayautomation.com/forge) has been released! 

I think this is the tool many community members here are looking for!

To me, it is a perfect WYSIWYG tool to build and run your UNS. Additionally to existing model building and data normalization/harmonization features, now you can not only access data in it via OPC UA REST API, but API is expanded to configure it too. Also, you can also browse the UNS via this API. It has Swagger API documentation, which is very nice too.
Another new feature is that now you can have MQTT data sources, that is, subscribe to MQTT topics not only in Pub/Sub format, but also plain MQTT with JSON  payload format. The same for publishing: payload can be in generic JSON format, or OPC UA Pub/Sub format.  

And one more feature to mention: it can be used as a historian too! Historical data then can be accesed either over OPC UA interface of via REST API. 

Complemented by DevieGateway, you can reach data from almost any industrial device.  We even offer it pre-instaleld in Industrial PC, with remore management / configuration  / access options.

Contact me for more details, for demos, and to download trial version to try it.","",""

Sepasoft Batch looked too restrictive for our use case. FactoryTalk Batch was discounted pretty quickly due to not having anything else Rockwell in the stack besides the PLC. In the end the SFCs were very heavily integrated into the custom workflows of Import Recipes (from RMS) -> Create Order(s) -> Create Run(s) -> Schedule Run(s) -> Execute Runs(s).  Updates from each stage were logged to the database as they occurred which enabled some really nice live dashboards and reports. This took it from Bulk ingredient to finished product with the end of one batch potentially being the bulk ingredients of the next until we ended up with a finished product.

WonderWare was good, but the latest version I've used is 2014, looked into 2017 which looked mostly the same but not after that.
Not cheap though and I believe they moved to a subscription-only license model from what I've heard.

Simatic batch not my favorite. Only really seemed to work alongside PCS7 and no easy way to configure in bulk. Might have been just me.
Also expensive and a very complex licensing model.

Playing with Sepasoft Batch Procedure module is on my todo list.
I downloaded the demo and it didn't seem to work very well from the get-go for being a demo, but to be fair the other systems I mentioned you CAN'T even just download and try it so I'll cut them some slack üôÇ 
I'll have to invest some time and give it a proper try. I also like the adherence to ISA standards and how open they are with documentation and pricing.
Since I tend to work with Ignition these days, Sepasoft will likely be my go-to recommendation to customers if it holds up, if not with their perspective components then just the DB and the api.

COPA-DATA also has a batch control module that looks good. 
Pricing is in line with sepasoft for unlimited, cheaper options are available as well limited on ISA88 unit count.
I played with it briefly but not in a real project.
It's built on top of their zenon platform so you'll need licenses for that too, similar to needing Ignition for Sepasoft (but here it's the same company).
They have a free trial license and online training so you can try it out for yourself.

I'd put some cheap hardware by each machine at this stage, depending on what you already have and what the environment is like.
A thin client, a panel PC, a simple tablet fixed at the location.
Or let the operators use their smartphone or tablet where they scan a barcode or nfc tag on the machine (or manual entry) to identify it before they hit start work order, ...
If your Ignition license includes perspective unlimited, I'd use that. Otherwise maybe NodeRed or a small custom app?

Where are these work orders managed? (MES, ERP?) does this system have a web interface you could use directly for this instead?
How do you plan on communicating the selected work order back to this system?
What if 2 machine operators decide to claim the same work order at the same time?

I have started to look into this option.  We are looking for better, budget-friendly, machine monitoring solutions and AWS IoT Greengrass + SiteWise seem to be a good fit.

ATM, I am trying to get a PoC going in our shop and using a Docker container to host a Greengrass device on prem (as a docker container), connect it to our OPC/UA server (KepwareEX6), which is harvesting tags from machines on the plant floor.

The AWS TAM helped me navigate the AWS Service Pricing Calculator and defined a cost picture with one of our plants. We liked it so much (compared to what we already have from different vendor) and it was enough evidence to sink some time into a more formal PoC.","",""

1. A graphic UI for visualization is great, but I feel like it doing change management and history in a low-code tool would be a nightmare compared to code-only. Now I know that node-red has ""Projects"" and change history built in but managing these changes still feels excessively difficult.
2. Another issue I have with the low-code solutions is the lack of standards for designing solutions. I'm worried I'll have rouge pipelines that no one understands and start breaking things when they get changed.
3. Logging and telemetry data in the pipelines. While we've able to successfully been able to add telemetry data for http requests to node-red it doesn't look like structured logs for JavaScript is supported by Open Telemetry, which is what we are trying to stick to.
We are still early in a I4.0 implementation, so I may be over exaggerating my needs here, and like I said I'm willing to change my mind.

- Descriptive: Is the ""what happened?"" 
- Diagnostic: ""Why did it happen?""
- Predictive: ""What is likely to happen?""
- Prescriptive: ""What should be done?""

Before you can get to Predictive, you have to have Descriptive and Diagnostic nailed down. Luckily, 80% of your problems are understanding what happened, and why it happened.

An example is a production line having an unscheduled downtime (descriptive), due to the line running too fast (diagnostic), and will continue doing so for the next week until a specific work order is done (predictive). To complete the work order on schedule and prevent future unscheduled downtimes, we need to slow the line down to the optimal speed (prescriptive).

While there are few options on CMMS platforms, most of them will fall flat if you don't provide the Descriptive and Diagnostic information needed to get Predictive analytics. 

Now I don't really have advice on which CMMS I would recommend (I'll let others do that), the core flaw in every CMMS is the lack of information feeding into it. We are getting better at this with technologies like IO-Link and better tools like NodeRED to help contextualize and transfer the data to where they need to go, but your CMMS will only be as good as the information that you feed into it. So GIGO. Hope this helped üôÇ","","üëç (3)"

They aren't designed to do protocol conversion like DF1, so whatever software you use that handles DF1 will have to be able to point to the converter instead of a serial port.

If you choose to use node-red or python....I'm not sure how the DF1 libraries will pass to an ethernet device when it's expecting a serial port, without some extra work.

It looks like software comes with them for windows to create a ""virtual"" serial port, this would be key to making them work universally, but if you run on something like a raspberrypi....you'd have to find another route.","","üëç (1)"

I would reach out to an application engineer at Real Time Automation and IFM (or the vendor for all your existing IO-Link solutions).  Explain your goals and see what your options are.  

RTA has RS-485 gateways that can support as many as 32 devices.  Even if it's not exactly Modbus RTU, I'm sure they can find a way to accommodate your application.  Their units are fairly flexible in interpreting the signals and payloads.

IFM has an 4-20mA transducer adapter for IO-Link Masters.  You could pair this with third-party  conventional analog power sensors.  Don't read too much into the list price.  Request a quote for the desired volume.

Another option that might be worth exploring is Single Pair Ethernet (SPE).  This is sort of becoming a successor of serial fieldbuses in the process industries because it can go long distances, carries power, and is flexible about what is transported over it.  You could go IO-Link or TCP/IP.  This might open up more options in terms of the supporting infrastructure.

If you are measuring Electricity at the distribution board. Modbus RTU works well because you can daisy chain the meters easily.

Actually the whole issue started with the transformer loss. Upper management wanted a detailed power consumption report and the theoretical numbers weren't adding up so maintenance decided to show them up as loss (transformer, cables, etc.).

If your plant has many non-linear devices like variable frequency drives, the harmonics can also lead to significant power losses in LV cables and transformers, due to a phenomenon called skin effect. The main indicator here would be Thdi (total harmonic distortion of the current).

I would also recommend having a power meter on the MV side of the trafo (normally the MV switchgear should have such a meter). The delta between MV and main LV power meters will give you an indication of losses accross the transformer and main LV cables.

If the 70 meter cables you mentioned are on the LV side of the trafo, you will absolutely have losses accross those cables at high loads, unless they are signifficantly oversized. 
And as @Mark O'Donovan mentioned, normal full load losses for 2MVA 440V transformers are in the 5% - 6% range. This is by design, to keep the fault current rating  within managable levels (typically below 50kA). The no-load and full load loss parameters are normally stated on the transformer's nameplate, so  should be easy enough to check.

But yeah. You cannot manage what you don't measure. So power meters are a very good start. Then making sure the right data gets collected by SCADA to be correlated with operational/process data is the vital 2nd step.

If you want to get even more serious about monitoring the health of your plant's electrical infrastructure, there is also a range of temperature and humidity sensors that can simply be attached onto cables, busbars and transformers. They use inductive coupling to power their internal electronics, so no need for wiring, and they transmit their data over zigbee to a dataconcentrator. But I would only recommend this as a potential extra step after installing power meters.","","üî• (2)"

At the time I was testing the Siemens CC716, which does not connect to to Ethernet IP but might give some value to people here connecting Legacy Siemens Devices. It is not exactly cheap( ‚Ç¨1800) but 

It has 2 Ethernet ports and 1 Profibus(DP Port). you connect the one Port to the Device network and can communicate with multiple Siemens PLC's and Modbus devices, and you can connect DP only devices with the DP Port.

you can then create a set of Data points to read and write tot he PLC's you can export from TIA/Simatic Set 7 and import into the Webportal

you then can connect the Cloud Port and configure it to Publish and Subscribe to Mindsphere, Azure and AWS, or any other MQTT Broker( like the Mosquitto on my Raspberry PI). Or you can set it up as an OPC server too. 

There are a lot of customizations options, and control customising the payloads , triggers, etc

Certainly it seams a much better approach than trying to use the MQTT Client in the PLC ü§Æ 
I don't know at how many tags at what message rate the device would fall over

Looking for a recommendation/ approach to setting up a temperature sensor system for a food and bev client. They are currently monitoring their cool rooms with a hand gun every hour.

I want to bring the temps back into ignition, but how i get there is my question.

What can the site maintain?

What is already on site?

I would say if you have IOlink on site, look at Moreno from IFM.

One thing it needs is a better way to handle button type inputs. Because the MQTT messages only publish on the data record interval having a button is useless. Is there another way to capture it?

My original plan was to start the buzzer when the tank level got too low but I don't have a good way to capture the button input to silience the alarm.","",""

I got around this on mine by installing the NodeRed container and making a flow which subscribed to the sensor data topic and published it again (on another topic), but only if the value was different.  It's about 3 lines of Javascript!

That's a quick hack to make it do what you want.  If you need a little help with NodeRed, let me know.

I'm dragging the CMTK product owner to a TSN plugfest the day after tomorrow, and I shall mention that ""report by exception"" should be a built-in feature.  I'm pretty sure it's already in the backlog anyway, and the priority just needs tweaking.

BTW, if you're not using an SD-card, I suggest doing so.  The internal space runs out quickly once you install a bunch of containers.","",""

There is a company with 15 energy production plants. This company has deployed one Kepware instance at each plant. Using Kepware, they have developed a program in .NET to log data into MSSQL. Additionally, some plants also utilize InfluxDB, but the company is unsure how the data is being sent to Influx. They believe the logging is also done through Kepware. The data is visualized using Grafana.

Since I have experience in MES projects, the company reached out to me. They are dealing with significant confusion. They want to build an architecture that can adapt quickly to upcoming regulations in the energy sector. At the same time, they want their internal teams to handle tasks on the platform independently, without relying on an integrator firm. I agree with their perspective.

I don‚Äôt have much experience in this specific area. Do you think Kepware + Influx + Grafana is sufficient as a solution? Or would Kepware + Ignition + Historian be a better option? (It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Ignition‚Äôs Historian has a bad reputation, although I‚Äôm not sure how the new version performs.) Also, I‚Äôm not entirely sure why Grafana should be replaced with Ignition. The company asks if the platform could allow them to easily create drag-and-drop reports independently, but I‚Äôm skeptical. No matter how simple it is, internal teams often struggle and require consultant support or IT/OT teams to create these reports.

If Ignition is chosen, would it be better to have a single Ignition instance for all 15 energy plants, with Ignition Edge deployed at the plants? Have you had similar experiences in this context? Thank you.","",""
"894527802316046366","nickn5549","2024-12-20T18:07:24.7150000+08:00","This is a classic case of starting with tools instead of architecture. The company has accumulated a mix of technologies - Kepware, MSSQL, InfluxDB, and Grafana - without a clear strategy. It's like building 15 different houses and then trying to figure out how to connect them all.
Let's break this down into what they actually need:
First, they need reliable data collection. Kepware is good at this - it's one of the few things in industrial automation that just works. Keep it.
Second, they need a unified data architecture. Right now they're splitting data between MSSQL and InfluxDB, which is asking for trouble. This is where Ignition makes more sense than Grafana. Not because Grafana is bad - it's excellent at visualization - but because Ignition is an industrial platform, not just a visualization tool.
The question about a single Ignition instance versus Edge deployments is really about architecture. With 15 plants, you want a hub-and-spoke model: Edge at each plant feeding into a central Ignition system. This gives you both local autonomy and centralized control.
As for drag-and-drop reports - this is a trap. The promise of ""citizen developers"" always sounds good, but as the company suspects, it rarely works in practice. What you actually want is a well-designed system that makes it easy for technical people to build what the business needs.
The real solution isn't about picking tools - it's about building the right architecture. Start with a unified namespace, use Edge at the plants for local resilience, and centralize where it makes sense. The tools should serve the architecture, not the other way around.
Remember: architecture is destiny. Get that right, and the tool choices become obvious.","","üî• (3),üíØ (1)"

@NickN is right, sort out the Architecture first.
and a big thing to understand is how critical is local visualisation in each plant in particular>

I have built similar systems for multiple windfarms and had InTouch at each location, later changed to WinCCOA. Kepware operates locally at each plant, and all the data is collected in a Central PI historian, and then Power BI is used for visualisation tasks 

That was the approach in 2014, and I would not do it the same way. Attached is a conceptual re architecting that I am discussing 

In my case the telecoms connection was not always great so it is important to have local recording, and they also wanted to be able to see the data locally . and they did want to be able to control the switchgear from the site so a SCADA was required, so I would probably  today look at FrameworX on each site, with a MQTT broker and some simple visualisation, then push that to a Cloud Broker, tie it to a Time base historian and then look for some dashboarding software, check out peakboard, maybe if you want to self build.

So Ignition Edge might help you there, and if you  are thinking Ignition then 

What sort of budget are you thinking, My energy clients, will pay to ensure robustness, and infact very preformat open systems are treated sceptically,

If you already have Kepware that is a powerful start, and if you don't need local control, Kepware -> Influx -> Grafana is ok but Grafana is not really great as visualisation and you need to be able to write queries, so self building is out.

I do like Aveva Insights for self building dashboards and reports, and Avava are repositioning their historian to be more stand alone

I would be thinking of having Kepware -> Local Mosquitto, and some buffering 
then a Centra Broker with the new Timebase historian, and  Peakboard, to allow the self build

Ignition handles all of the functionality around historical data, from creating and partitioning the tables to the built in query functions - GUI Based Bindings and Scripting Functions for example. The data is just in tables though so there are some advanced functions that some integrators have created themselves on top of those tables directly. One Gateway can have multiple ""Historians"" set up too so if the database disk writes becomes an issue there are ways around that.

Technically, for large High Speed applications, other traditional Industrial Historians have outperformed it. Realistically, most applications are not going to stress it to the point where it becomes noticeable. 5,000 at 500ms that are only logged on exception is probably not a situation where any real performance difference would be noticed... I have used Ignition's Historian on Gateways with nearly half a million tags, with half of them set to be historized, on exception.

One of those built in features that Ignition gives is a window in their tag configuration where you can set the rules for what constitutes an exception, minimum time, maximum time, value based, etc...

If Ignition is in the picture, I struggle to recommend a raw Timeseries database against its Historian - There is just too much added complexity for so little noticeable improvement... I am playing with various options in the home lab but for production, I have no plans to replace it any time soon.

If Ignition is not in the picture, for an industrial application, I would be on TimeBase. For me, I start to look to the Timeseries Databases in more IT centric applications or as part of the stack where IT and OT collide.

Long story short - Ignition's Historian comes with a lot of prebuilt integrations with Ignition, rebuilding those to be as good or better is time consuming, costly, and more that needs to be maintained.","","üëç (3)"

Use the following modules:
- N3uron OPC-UA Client - Connecting Kepware to N3uron using OPC-UA
- N3uron Historian - it's based on MongoDB and is quite high performance. It would have no issue with your current scope. It has it's own Historian browser with excel export.
- N3uron Web Vision - If you want to have dashboards.
- N3uron Rest API - Server  - So other system can get the data (both real-time and historical) e.g. Power BI
N3uron License is 720EUR/780USD per module, unlimited tags. So it would be 3-4 licenses 2,340-3,120USA.
This would be a low-code/no-code alternative to the Kepware + Influx + Grafana with a much lower cost than the Kepware + Ignition + tag Historian. If you don't need the power of Ignition Perspective then this is a great option.
N3uron has a free 2-hours trial download  like Ignition https://n3uron.com/downloads-software/ You can request a no question ask 30 days free trial too. https://licenses.n3uron.com/trial/

Its thrown in a cluster because at scale the number of uploaded laps is quite high, but at off hours the number of laps is quite low so I down scale to save on compute cost.","","üëç (2)"

In terms of why the data is needed and what it will be used for is an ongoing conversation.

A few sentence update to a given project is either lost in an email or the requesters end up calling an unnecessary meeting.  
Were on the controls/equipment management side of the house so lots of the projects we do are modifications and upgrades to existing equipment or infrastructure.  Whatever information we end up sharing should be in some way be tied back to the context of our site, which now is best pulled together in the context of our UNS.  So its not that this information even needs to be pushed into the UNS however it should reference the UNS to the degree of the equipment that the work may be about.

"568913935147728896","zeratall","2025-01-31T06:14:06.0630000+08:00","@jamesgresql  So, full transparency: today is my last day at NG, and my new role is at Flow. I may be a bit biased, but some things I really liked about Timebase that made it a great fit for my specific use case:

1) Read performance, I persist high-frequency telemetry from race cars, and many of my reports involve a few hundred thousand data points. In the past, I tried using Influx. While the write performance was really strong and InfluxQL is robust (you can do some cool things with relational like queries), it was always too slow for my specific needs. Timebase was the first historian where I could render dashboards directly with acceptable load times (from my testing using the Explorer I was averaging 500k pt/s over a 6 min job)

2) Easy deployment automation, some historians have this, some don‚Äôt, but I really appreciate how straightforward it is to automate Timebase deployments using standard practices. The services support containerization and integrate well with DevOps strategies like GitOps. In my case, I'm looking at automating the deployment of collectors on demand, and Timebase makes this simple with its config-file approach.

3) Simplicity for POCs, timebase has handy features that make it easy to get proofs of concept up and running. For example, the MQTT collector lets you define simple, simple JSON, and complex JSON, which is perfect if you just need to throw data into the historian and start testing right away, or if you have a more complex data structure where you do need to map all the metadata.  https://timebase.flow-software.com/en/knowledge-base/mqtt-collector#Type-1

4) It's fully free, since my web app is a passion project, Timebase being completely free was a huge motivator for me.

That said, there are a few things to keep in mind. Timebase is still early in its development cycle, and while new features are coming out all the time, some standard enterprise capabilities (like AD integration) aren't implemented yet. All of the standard enterprise features you'd expect are on the roadmap.","","üî• (3)"

We just faced a request from a customer to find a lower cost alternative to the Ignition Tag Historian that they are using. The main expenses being the AWS RDS storage. A few requirements:
- Has to work with Ignition
- Up to 300k Tags with about 12k tag change per seconds
- Store the data for over 5 years
- Has other method of analysing the data in the historian other than Ignition. (Since Ignition Perspective isn't so great at doing this)

We have though of a few things:
- How to ingest data from Ignition
- Having a good lossless compression that will result in small amount of storage cost
- Being able to get the data for analysis.

Came up with AWS Timestream for InfluxDB (basically InfluxDB) and Timebase as the alternative.
- We can ingest the data to Timebase from OPC-UA and Timestream using MQTT
- Storage should be much smaller and cheaper than RDS
- Both have API and SQL like retrieval.

Adding our current experience to the conversation. What product would you recommend? Our engineer is setting this up to test to report back to the customer so I will be able to add more details later on.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1040035658187669504/1335090843547078676/image.png?ex=68df443d&is=68ddf2bd&hm=f55db5adfa678daa010c1ef680dfa33f5125859bae2317b1104656805c62bf10&",""

As I have an innate distrust of cloud storage... Cloud backups are awesome, cloud hosted distribution is great, fog can be cool - but storing significant amounts of important data solely on someone else's server(s) just doesn't sit right with me. I can't think of a deeper form of vendor lock myself... 

That said, if my goal was the cheapest reliable cloud storage I would have to first know what the criteria was. 

Not just ingestion rates and storage length but also how the data would be accessed... 

From there I would try to identify the various options that meet those requirements and the costs associated. Again - not just the cost of ingestion, but also the cost to store it, and the cost to retrieve it. Even the cost to pull it all out if that were ever needed. 

From there I would evaluate the options and identify their costs. 

Once we have identified a few options, then we would have to determine the risks associated with each and make a choice. 

Other factors would be if we are storing every reading or if the sender is doing any sort of filtering, aggregation, or report by exception. As that may help reduce the costs but also may make the data a lot less useful... 

As far as capabilities, I am sure that most anything can handle 300k tags with 12k changes per second over a 5 year period...

That's really not that many tags in the grand scheme of things, I have sites with twice that running in Ignition's historian with a basic SQLServer on premise managed by their own IT department. For access outside of Ignition, I would just wrap their scripting functions in the Web-Dev module. 

If there is an aversion to the Ignition Historian, I would probably look into Timebase by Flow as they can just hook right up to the tags with their OPC-UA Collector... 

If we are talking about raw Timeseries databases, I think any of the popular ones would do it without any issues, QuestDB and Influx can both connect to the OPC-UA tags with Telegraf so that would make it easier to ingest...

If cost is the issue, it's probably off the table but something like Highbyte could make a good bridge as well if needed. 

Though for cloud storage costs specifically I really don't have any recommendations one way or another. 

I hear a lot about Snowflake, AWS has their options, and all of the time series databases have hosting options to look into... I just haven't done my own research into which options make the most sense for which applications.","",""

In my opinion, and why we are so tightly tied to Snowflake, is because they designed it from the OT layer up. 

In January of 2023 I sat in a room with @Arlen Nipper, @Benson Hougland, @Travis Cox and Snowflake, and we talked about what the Snowflake Manufacturing Data cloud should look like. 

In April of that year, they launched it, with full support of OT data types and MQTT SparkplugB, soon to support vanilla MQTT. (In terms of auto-generated tables).

For more conventional BI with tabular data, I think Sigma has a compelling offering. First, I like the spreadsheet like interface for users to build reports and refine curated views. One of the common challenges I've seen with BI at scale is that users, at all technical levels, want some capability to interact and further curate the data. This often leads to the less-technical users or those with less control over the BI platform/strategy using BI as a data acquisition tool to rebuild what they want in their own tools or Excel. Empowering data constituents is really important. 

Second, I like how Sigma puts the data warehouse to use. The other issue I've seen with BI tools at scale is figuring out where in the stack additional refinement happens. Some orgs rightfully try to get this right in the warehouse, but there is an endless backlog for data engineers and BI analysts to work on views. Some try to avoid bottlenecks and lean on the BI layer. This often leads to suboptimal use of compute. BI owners will find themselves unraveling latency issues, timeouts, inefficient transforms, governance issues, etc. For example, users will try to tabulate large datasets in the presentation layer rather than using the warehouse to perform aggregate calculations and other heavy lifting. And, finally, some will put an ETL or conditioning solution like Alteryx in the middle. I've seen this work, but it requires some foresight and planning.

Sigma, when paired with a good data warehouse like Snowflake, reminds me a bit how Periscope Data was evolving before it peat out after the Sisense acquisition years ago. Periscope figured out how to tap into the performance of Redshift without the hassle of managing it. It broke down the silos between presentation and warehouse. The R and Python options introduced later unlocked a lot of capabilities. Sigma has accomplished much of this but with an easier UX for more users.","",""

If an org has a lot of historian data, Seeq makes it easy for non-technical users to work with time series data. If the data is tabular, Sigma has spreadsheet-like interface for staging datasets for reports.

I do think it‚Äôs important to eventually consider a data warehouse (could be a standard database). Users will eventually want to create KPIs over time. OEE and Gross Margin, for example, require summing and dividing a ton of records. The datasets will get really large and the underlying data may need to be revised or will be late arriving (e.g., misclassified downtime, change/consolidation of master data, returned shipment / refund). It quickly becomes inefficient or impossible to do this within a BI tool. Even at a small manufacturer,  it does not take much for users to run into limitations of a BI tool. Manufacturers generate a lot of data.  A warehouse does requires some technical capabilities but it has gotten considerable easier in recent years. Someone with some experience working with databases can learn quickly. To get started, it can make sense to adopt existing investments IT may have with a cloud provider (AWS, MS). Snowflake is nice because it‚Äôs pretty easy to use and is abstracts the complexity of managing/sizing the underlying infrastructure. If there‚Äôs absolutely nothing, experiment with a database first. Understanding how to build efficient queries for BI is what‚Äôs ultimately important.

If a small company has nothing and is just getting into reporting, Power BI is easy to get started. Most orgs already have M365 and, in some cases, already have it licensed (e.g., E5).","","üíØ (1)"

It's a commitment and can take considerable resources to figure out. While it's a better experience for prospects and consultants doing research, it may not necessarily be a priority for those most likely to buy. For example, prospects can see the cost of licensing Power BI. It does not include the support or expertise to be successful. They might need to look into Azure Synapse and consultants/employees to meet their desired outcomes. Instead of trying to cater to ""tire kickers"" who want to compare price, a smaller company like Sigma might seek out more motivated and educated buyers. That buyer might be more concerned with overall TCO (not just licensing cost) and specific functionality. With finite resources, sometimes it can be a best use of resources to simply qualify prospects and provide them access to technical teams. Ultimately, our expectations as consumers on what is convenient is not necessarily relevant for businesses with pressing, complex problems to solve.

If I were a customer of an SI, I would want the SI to educate me about all solutions and which best meets my needs. I would not be concerned with how easy or difficult they felt it was to research products through google searches. I would want to tap into their vast knowledge, experience, and networks. I would also want them to be aware of the nuances of AWS marketplace (e.g., CPQ limitations, contracts, public offers) and that most enterprise software on it is transacted through private offers.

You could build a Pipeline to expose the directory and files as an API. The Pipeline could be setup to keep track of what has been successful processed from the text file(s). Flow would connect using its Cloud/WebService client interface to HighByte's REST Data Server. You could build a custom endpoint for the client. Flow also has an MQTT Client.

Ignition benefits greatly from having the tag provider and the HMI elements within the same platform, such that you can add elements to the HMI and instantly bind them to tag values that you just picked from a list. No need to write Javascript (unless you want to), complex REST calls (that you have to test in Postman separately) or Remote Process Calls (RPC). Simply: ""when I click this ON button, the value of the tag *IS_ON* toggles from false to true.

Based on earlier versions of ThingsBoard, I've felt that the extra time it would take me to set up an HMI versus Ignition would easily offset the price of an Ignition Edge Panel license (currently $1,850). Maybe that's just because I'm already so familiar with Ignition (Core Certified), but I would seriously consider using ThingsBoard more if someone could show me how to develop in it as quickly as I can in Ignition.","",""

Their definition of devices is basically MicroControllers, nothing industrial shows up on their site at all. Which makes sense as they appear to be branding it as an IoT platform not an IIoT one. 

It looks like if I wanted to use it in an industrial space I would still need Kepware, Ignition, or some gateway to convert field protocols to MQTT or OPC-UA. Basically cutting it out as an option as an HMI, which is fine. But it adds in the cost of these gateways to the overall deployment.  Unless it's part of a Node-Red based stack? 

I guess this is the long way to ask @vikan is Thingsboard and IoT or an IIoT platform? From what I see it looks like an IoT. Not Industrial.

My understanding is that they're focused on F&B and provide some out-of-box functionality for processes subject to compliance and auditing. The target buyer are quality teams that need tooling or business processes to adopt. The cost of designing and implementing a QMS (the business processes, not the software per se) can be very high. For many companies, they lack the personnel to do this from scratch. They look look to consultants and off-the-shelf software to get there.

I'm sometimes skeptical when SCADA developers and SIs claim they can build things in Ignition or other platforms cheaper. Yes, I'm sure there exist conditions where that is true. Yes, it's possible to develop a better set of screens and bind them to a database to target a lower acquisition cost. But, what's the total cost of ownership? More importantly, does it actually solve the industry requirements? Who is managing and verifying all the requirements? Who is paying for their time? Has this solutuion actually gotten through a third-party audit? Can line-of-business users who are not technologists ""own"" this solution and manage evolving requirements going forward?

There's a tax compliance software called Avalara. It's super useful for manufacturers that do business globally. It automatically figures out all the different local tax implications (e.g., sales tax, VAT, customs, filing) for A/R processes at the time of shipment. I'm sure someone could configure/customize their ERP to do this, but understanding all the requirements and keeping them up to date would be challenging. A solution like Avalara is not bought as software per se, but as a business process. The pricing of the software does not matter relative what it would take to develop a substitute. It's the business process and its cost is what matters. It's a repeatable, undifferentiated business process that can be automated and outsourced by a competent vendor with domain expertise.","","üëç (1)"

But it's a one time cost.  Likewise with SIs the scope is clear - they design to the mutually agreed upon specifications.  With pre-made software you're inherently paying for a myriad of features that your buisness may not have a use for.

Case and point, safetychain tries to advertise that it can provide OEE.  OEE should not come from a QMS...  and I certainly don't trust some software integrators who spend a few weeks at the facility to built an OEE model worth anything.","","üëç (2)"

Also I tend to be an outlier, so probably not the best case study...

But in Node Red in general, even dashboard 1.0, the nodes always feel pretty clunky and require a lot of work arounds and scripting to get right. To the point that I like to do the front end in a platform that is not Flow Based.
Node Red for me is at it's best as a backend Integration Layer.

Say, Connecting to PLCs and Databases and exposing their data through a REST or GraphQL API. Doing the Front End in say Appsmith or Grafana. My distaste of Grafana aside...

For me, If FlowFuse was to be the Front End, I would really want a drag and drop interface separate from the Flows. Not dissimilar to Appsmith, Ignition Perspective, or more ideally Figma.

Though, as I said, I don't think I represent the full market here... I tend to prefer either Full Code or No Code for UI/UX - Most things in the middle are incredibly frustrating to work with.
Node Red Dashboard 2.0 and Appsmith are among the better ones that I know. Though I haven't gotten any time on Retool..

Sigma is ""extraction-less"" and provides a self-service spreadsheet-like interface. It leans on the warehouse to transform and calculate the data. Some of the modern data platforms like Snowflake, for example, have gotten good for creating time series oriented data products. Orgs are starting to have luck materializing operational time series data into tabular data sets that are easy for line-of-business users to work with. I wouldn't overlook traditional relational BI - especially for the the batch, MES, ERP, etc data. Figuring out some common ways users will query/analyze the data and designing a schema around those requirements can go a long way. Seeq is great for time series analysis. It's very process engineer friendly for ad-hoc and exploration. Eventually, you'll probably want to formalize this into mainline reports either in Seeq or in your BI layer. Seeq has a ADX connector.

Azure Data Explorer (ADX), being KQL-based, might limit your options in terms of BI. There are database drivers that the KQL can be passed through to return data sets, but any of the drag-and-drop tools in BI tools that generate or bind to SQL queries might be an issue. Power BI is an obvious option with its native support for ADX. It's a question of  how productive business users can be working with time series data in it. It might be too raw or the tooling (e.g., DAX, M) might not be enough or too hard to work with. 

Yeah, that's a common complaint about Grafana. It's meant to observe infrastructure. Manufacturing is so much more dynamic where the thing you're observing is influenced by supply chain, batch/lot/inventory, operator, tooling, maintenance, environmental factors, etc. The what-if scenarios can become so complex so quickly. If you're still interested in checking it out, it appears Grafana has an ADX plugin.","","üî• (1)"

Core Concept: Spec-Driven Development with Testsprite 2.0 MCP is to application behavior what GitOps is to infrastructure deployment - both provide declarative, continuous, drift-free delivery pipelines.
Key Difference:
GitOps solved deployment (code ‚Üí running infrastructure)
Spec-Driven Development solves development itself (requirements ‚Üí tested code)
How It Works:
Write behavioral specs (not YAML manifests)
MCP server auto-generates tests and scaffolded code
Claude 4 iterates on implementation until all tests pass
Promotes artifacts to production with same reliability as GitOps
THE ULTIMATE VISION: SPEC-TO-PRODUCTION PIPELINE

Today: Two separate pipelines (Development + Deployment)
Tomorrow: Single business spec auto-generates BOTH application code AND Kubernetes manifests

Concept:
A Sub-Agent is a lightweight Claude worker spun up on demand to handle a single, well-scoped task.
Multiple Sub-Agents run in parallel; the parent Claude instance coordinates their outputs.
BMAD (simplified):
Break the problem into atomic tasks.
Map each task to a Sub-Agent prompt & tool set.
Aggregate all Sub-Agent answers.
Decide/Deploy: parent agent merges results, returns final answer or calls next steps.
Repo quick-start (github.com/zhsama/claude-sub-agent)
agent_parent.py ‚Äì sample controller showing BMAD loop.
sub_agent.py ‚Äì wrapper that launches a Claude chat with a task-specific system prompt.
tasks/ ‚Äì ready-made task definitions you can copy or extend.
run_demo.sh ‚Äì spins up three parallel Sub-Agents, aggregates, prints combined output.
Try it in 5 steps
git clone https://github.com/zhsama/claude-sub-agent
Put your Claude API key in .env.
Edit tasks/*.json to match your problem slices.
python agent_parent.py ‚Äì watch Sub-Agents spawn, solve, merge.
Tune prompts or add tools; iterate.
Why care:
Parallelism ‚áí big latency wins.
Scoped prompts ‚áí higher relevancy, less hallucination.
Save money in API tokens ‚áí smaller focused prompts cost less than one massive context window.
BMAD loop keeps everything deterministic and auditable

Why sub-agents save token costs:
Smaller prompts = fewer input tokens per request
No context bloat = each sub-agent only gets relevant context, not everything
Model flexibility = use cheaper models (Haiku) for simple tasks, Sonnet/Opus only when needed
Higher success rates = fewer expensive retries from failed complex prompts
Parallel efficiency = pay for what you actually process, not one giant sequential prompt

Start small (3-4 tasks), measure speed/quality, then scale out. 10 minute sprints for the masses ‚Äî Counting down to ProveIt!","",""

Core Concept
Claude Sub Agents are to System Prompts what Cursor Rules are for AI-generated code guardrails.
Simple analogy:
Cursor Rules managed code behavior (Global ‚Üí Project scope)
Claude Sub Agents manage conversation behavior (User ‚Üí Project scope)
Chained Sub Agent Orchestration
Think restaurant kitchen brigade system:
Head Chef (orchestrator) coordinates the entire meal
Station Chefs (specialized sub agents) handle specific tasks:
Garde manger (data preparation)
Saucier (analysis and reasoning)
Pastry chef (final formatting/presentation)
Each chef passes work to the next station. The head chef ensures proper sequencing, quality control, and final output meets requirements.
The magic: Specialization + Coordination = complex outputs no single agent could produce alone.
Claude Code Hooks
Just as IDE extensions hook into specific coding moments (file save, build, debug), Claude Code Hooks inject AI assistance at precise development lifecycle points.
Instead of copying/pasting system prompts or re-explaining needs, you simply invoke the appropriate Sub Agent that already ""knows"" your context.
Result: Persistent, reusable system prompts that eliminate repetitive setup and ensure consistent AI behavior.
The Evolution Path
Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí MCP (Tools)
Your meta-agent becomes self-improving by:
Recognizing repetitive work patterns
Auto-spawning new sub-agents for those patterns
Continuously refining your agent ecosystem
Evolution: Manual prompts ‚Üí Sub Agents ‚Üí Code Hooks ‚Üí Meta-Agents that build themselves
This creates an exponentially scaling AI workforce that adapts and grows with your needs.

For many industries, quality is paper and they don't know any other way so they unfortunately adopt a literal electronic equivalent of the process in software.

It's tough. There are not a lot of good options. I think most manufacturers are probably best seeing what they can lean on in their ERP or PLM suite to do and then try to extend that in a flexible application platforms (e.g., Tulip). The problem with these suites is the UX is usually poor for line-of-business users and there are gaps, but the backend master data can be useful.

Hexagon has a sprawling portfolio. They did buy QDAS and ETQ Reliance. Apparently, there is some web-based version of QDAS for SPC that doesn't look like WindowsXP era software. ETQ has a modern interface and they've done some integration with QDAS and the metrology products like PC-DMIS.

If you're a Salesforce shop, I might look into Propel PLM. They have some quality management stuff and it might be more extensible running on the SFDC platform.

I would talk with FactBird about their product aspirations. They're a lightweight OEE solution with some basic process control functionality. They have both small and big customers that speak highly of them. I'm curious what they would build given the opportunity.

I really liked Plex's approach. The routing, part specs, BOMs, FMEA, control plans, SPC, etc integrate nicely. It really ""operationalizes"" quality from receiving to production to shipping and it has APIs to tie into automation. Most of the functionality was built for and funded by automotive customers in the US. It audits well for ISO 9001, IATF 16949, VDA 6.3, MMOG/LE. I increasingly can't recommend Plex because they're too slow with enhancements, customer satisfaction issues, and Rockwell's reputation with software. I don't know if they would still sell it as a point solution with just the relevant quality modules.","",""
