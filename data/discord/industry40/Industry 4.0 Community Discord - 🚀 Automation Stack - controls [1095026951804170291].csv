Distributed control is embedded in IEC61499 concept. You don't need to even think about it. With IEC61131, you will need to sync and define communication between controllers. And also, this distribution could be modified on the fly without disruption in the control execution. Actual runtime engine are still basic but they are now taking another step. Customers by Universal Automation organisation and OPAF are leading the evolution of those engine runtimes to become even more flexible, more reliable, including high availability capability. One of my concerns though is that they rely a little bit too much on OPC-UA as communication backbone for interoperability with orchestration systems and SCADA.","","üëçüèº (1),üôèüèº (1)"

To address this, my proposed concept of a one-minute granularity for edge PLC devices aims to balance the need for real-time data from devices like PLCs with the requirements of MES, ERP, and potentially SCADA systems.

With this one-minute granularity, MES ""real-time"" functions more like a frame rate, offering aggregated data for rapidly changing events, such as start and end states, state counts, runtime vs. downtime duration, and total part counts. When discrepancies arise between daily part counts and work order allocations, OT tools can function like high-speed cameras, examining these events in detail. This approach allows for improved scalability and performance, even for applications that demand response times in the seconds range.

Debouncing is an important concept too when discussing real-time controllers in Industry 4.0 MES systems. Implementing a one-minute granularity for edge PLC devices serves as a debounce mechanism, balancing real-time data requirements with system performance. This approach filters out rapid fluctuations, such as operators starting and stopping production orders, that hold little value for MES analysis.","",""

The idea wouldn't be to loss site of the micro stops is would be to capture them at the edge Realtime device and and use a statistical approach to analyze them in MES.  Then extra measures would  be taken at the edge to capture higher frequency data that would be changing too quickly at the edge.

The issue that I have seen with MES systems in general is that they are often not seen as reliable enough on for item counting for final FG item counts against WOs.  Making PCs accountable for Realtime data better suited for PLCs or other Realtime devices is the other reason I am considering this.  I am sure your are well acquainted with these issues.  With overload systems latency/scalability issues worsen, and virtualized system can be stunned and worsen these issues too.

The minute granularity is a somewhat arbitrary too, in my case I was thinking this was a good fit considering hardware capabilities and MQTT being good for about a 500ms SLA.  My experience with CPG bottling lines is the fast ones are about 17 bottles a second.","",""

Like case packers and palletizers move slower and may not have these advanced needs.  Or be seen as secondary work cells where item counts are not as critical in assessing line OEE.

Here is a condensed statement for clarity.  

""Incorporating real-time devices for data collection and using a statistical approach in MES for analysis can enhance system performance and reliability, particularly in fast-paced environments like CPG bottling lines. By choosing the appropriate granularity, considering hardware capabilities and MQTT's 500ms SLA, and addressing latency and scalability issues, we can improve the overall effectiveness of MES systems in capturing accurate final FG item counts against WOs.""","",""

This would be something like MQTT to a schemeless store  using Kafka. Then an exception reporting application data base would allow for amending corrections to the event sourced ledger so there would be a full audit history of changes.

My other hope in doing this is that the universal concerns that are not yet complicated be assessing if activities fir to a plan or not could be made in to a generic implementation on an IoT device. This would allow for the ideals associated with IoT devices, like buying a IoT home device, you drop it in and it works and you have data analytics too.

I would normally advise clients to keep the safety system as separate as possible from the functional side. If you are in Process and following EN  61511 then keeping the BPCS(Basic Process Control System) and the SIS( Safety Instrumented System) is an important requirement that is often overlooked. EN 13849 and EN 62061 you can combine the functionality but I prefer to keep them separate as standard and only combine them if there is and advantage.

By combining the Safety and standard slices in a single Remote IO rack, you will need to have a safety rated RIO head( fieldbus coupler) and a safety rated fieldbus protocol. If that is all in a single panel fair enough. But if you want to use the network and maybe transit from VLAN to VLAN and maybe even VRF to VRF, you start to have issues, switches that can handle the protocols, staff managing firewalls that don't understand fieldbus. I would not 

The other question is what logic solver is the safety slice communicating with. Is the host PC performing safety logic. It won't meet the requirements for any safety standard that I know of.

Fundamentally I don't understand the big idea. you want to use a Standard NIC as part of a safety system. Is the NIC intended for use in a safety system? Can you collect the relevant parameters to calcualte the SIL rating?","",""

They're not all that intelligent and they were stood up as a lower cost alternative to relay-based control. In the past, I've had no problem scrutinizing operations for being ""Industry 2.5"".  When there are ridiculous bandaids and manual procedures to keep a process running, an investment in proper automation is probably long overdue.

With respect to IIoT connectivity, I very much agree.  It's best to allow PLCs to be PLCs.  It's much easier to supplement a proper process control node with connectivity than dealing with shortcomings in the automation.  I'd rather connect Kepware to a processor with integrated motion, safety, alarming, etc and an organized program than something short of this with embedded MQTT and OPC UA.  Having all the data concentrated in one place is so much easier.

I'm a little puzzled by the strong interest in some of the IIoT-friendly PLCs.  They seem to fall short in the automation department.  Having a stable platform, talent to program it, adoption by machine builders, healthy fieldbus ecosystem, global availability, etc are important.

A PLC or HMI can have all the ""northbound"" connectivity in the world.  If it doesn't have a complete picture of the automation events, it's not useful.  If it's not connecting to the drives over a fieldbus, it's harder to do predictive maintenance on motors.  If it can't see the raw events feeding a safety relay or controller, it's harder to understand safety events.  There's nothing worse than seeing an asset is not cycling or in a fault state without any indication why.

This is also why I have particular disdain for machine builders and SIs.  They'll cut every corner to lower the acquisition cost, recycle ancient designs, and drag their feet when pressed (and budgeted) to do the right thing.  Automation should have a reasonable amount of intelligence.  It can be extremely costly to add this later.","","üíØ (3)"

My view is that PLCs have had open connectivity capabilities beyond field-bus for over a decade, on proven reliable controls platforms.
So is it the PLC that didn't live up to the objectives? Or was it that the PLCs are underutilized in implementation?

I agree that when the primary role is reliable control, then the PLC should prioritize this over IIOT friendliness.
But I also believe that realtime and reliable controls can live beside the technology of the next generation where everything is connected, and providing value beyond the controls.

I think it's more about implementation priorities, methodologies, and ease of implementation.

As you mentioned, Integrators and machine builders are under pressure to work with reduced budgets, and creating reliable automation is priority over data intelligence.
I think this is the biggest hurdle when building equipment that ready to ""plug and play"" into the business

The controls platform has an endless stream of high speed data, and intimate access to far more valuable data than most realize. 
If we combine that with the new compute and connectivity technologies, good practices, reduce the barrier to implement....then we will can reduce technical debt, and speed up integration of the equipment into the ecosystem then continue innovating instead of finding workarounds to benefit from sub-par capabilities.","",""

When I was on the buy-side of industrial automation, here were my top pet peeves:

**1) Missing or incomplete communications support. **
For example, AB MicroLogix 1400 does not support CIP Class 1 messaging in its EtherNet/IP interface.  Why even bother if it can‚Äôt be used with other field devices that will be invariably added down the road?  Another example, Fanuc-based machine builders shipping CNCs and robots without any of the communication options enabled. What they thought lowered the acquisition by X actually costs the user 20X in research, delays, administrative overhead navigating these gaps. There is nothing worse than watching a large line installation project fall apart because vendors don't know the difference between E/IP Scanner, E/IP Adapter, CIP Safety, SRTP/SNPX, FOCAS2, PROFINET Controller, PROFINET Device, etc and the different packages and SKUs that enable them.","","üòÇ (1)"

For example, the reason AB SLC500 hardware was on sale in the past decade was for existing install bases. There is no excuse to use this on brand new assets. It adds unnecessary MRO cost and prevents one from adopting any PLC advancements from the last twenty years. As another example, imagine spending millions on automation with the latest Siemens CNC and Bosch-Rexroth servo-hydraulic tech. Imagine discovering that the latest SINUMERIK 840D SL hardware is running S7-300 era firmware and must be programmed with S7 Classic. No TIA Portal, no aliased memory, no browsing, limited connectivity, etc. Here‚Äôs another. Suppose a vendor trying to ship a new asset with an EoL AB CompactLogic series whose last major firmware release was 15 years ago. Imagine the notion of adopting 90s-era motion control tech like SECROS I/II in 2018. What overworked ops team wants to add to their training backlog, stock obscure hardware, support yet another fiber optic media, etc?

**3) Missing documentation or obscured memory objects**
If one is spending millions on automation that‚Äôs going to be around for the next few decades, they should be able to understand what it‚Äôs doing and integrate it with their automation landscape. Sure, sometimes there are concerns over IP or liability, but the interests of the end user tend not to conflict with this. Users desire extensibility. They want to solve problems and make their automation more productive. They could care less about the source code or competing with the machine builder. Now, imagine if an OS or an app platform had no APIs. No one would use them. Yet, machine builders seem to think this should not apply to them.","","üíØ (1)"

As discussed earlier, all the events and context need to be accessible from a single place. There should be some multidiscipline PLC supervising all the I/O, motion, safety, alarms, etc.  All of this should be on a modern Ethernet-based fieldbus. End users shouldn‚Äôt have to connect to five different controllers and construct logic figure out what is going on.  Additionally, if a sensor is monitoring something, there should be a numeric process value in the PLC‚Äôs memory. Using sensors as a switch is worthless for industry 4.0.  There‚Äôs nothing to optimize or predict if the entire data set are booleans. Imagine if the instrumentation in a car or aircraft were indicated as only booleans (e.g., AboveSpeedLimit = TRUE, BelowFL100 = TRUE). It would make operating them considerably more difficult.

**5) Non-browsable namespaces**
There is no excuse for this. One should not have to be programming the PLC, reading the machine manual, maintaining a spreadsheet, contacting the vendor, etc to understand what data is available in a device.  It should be browsable over a protocol. One should not have to understand what B10:0/11, R1000, M251, etc are to use data from their own automation. Fanuc and low-end AB (e.g., MicroLogix) are offenders of this.","","üíØ (1)"

It's much better with an all in one controls platform, and controls technology today can have architectures that allow for this. 
I agree that bools by themselves don't offer much external value, but there can be some very valuable information derived under context. For example a 2 position actuator, the sensors inputs themselves only give us confirmation of it's position at each end, but when you measure the time it takes to arrive at said sensor...now we have some derived value from booleans.
5 - This is a function of necessity on older and budget controls platforms because they are memory address based, and many of them the technology doesn't exist to have a more meaningful ""name"" inside of the namespace. At the end of the path of abstraction for humans there will always be a memory address, but the move to tag based controllers will help as long as the names are organized and semantic, which is another challenge.

SICS is a peer to peer, pull-response protocol and that‚Äôs where I have my theoretical problem with it - the device itself does not broadcast event-driven. So as soon as a user interacts with the scale directly‚Ä¶there is no way to figure out which weighing mode the scale is in, what the tara value stored is and thus how to interprete the weight value returned by the scale. You need all this information in real time to make it meaning full‚Ä¶it gets worse when you have Terminal such as an IND in place as your interface, as you need to keep track, which connected scale is currently active and sends values‚Ä¶I am sure there are several approaches to go about (behind the general question how to turn a pull-response communication into a valid event driven publisher).

Or the IoT 2050 you can install a Node Red with the Siemens Library Preloaded and read from Siemens S7 and publish to MQTT Vanilla or SPB

I think both the CC716 and the IoT2050 need the DB to be not Optimized, so uses direct addressing. 

I have both of the options in a customer Panel with an S7-1200 publishing MQTT and I would go the Node-Red route. In fact I did , the project was to evaluate the options. the CC716 does give a nice bit of segregations between the Device layer and the MQTT broker if that is needed

I'm also seeing boxes like the [SeeedStudio reComputer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-R1035-10-p-5925.html) which are just glorified rPIs with dual ethernet and serial connections but 1/10th the cost.

Hardware gateways would mean I could probably avoid a software gateway entirely at that point. I'd roll up data to a broker directly, whether on-prem or in the cloud. Alternatively, I avoid hardware gateways entirely and somehow get my equipment on a vendor dmz or something and pull data from the equipment with something like Kepserver or Ignition.

Given that Kepserver and Ignition are good about demo licenses, that should be pretty easy to prototype. The hardware solution is a bit trickier. And I'll still need some simulated PLC (or better yet a real test PLC) to pull from.

All devices have 2 or 3 separate Ethernet ports, and the standard apps included for free like S7 Connector already publish data internally over MQTT for sending anywhere (plus you also get S7 optimized, unlike with Node-RED, because that protocol is still proprietary).

You're right about culture and funding, but there is a deeper root cause. The PE world has a name for these. They're called ""lifestyle businesses"". Imagine not running a business on a P&L or engineering basis, but for vanity. An owner may have been good at one or two things. They may have developed an interesting manufacturing process or had success securing business in the past, but they're incapable of delegation, yielding to expertise, or developing best practices. Having filthy, unmaintained plants or unknowingly accepting unprofitable sourcing agreement are the telltale signs. This manufacturing boss' identity centers around golfing, being a member of the local chamber of commerce, complaining no one wants to work, and being insufferable in any conversation adjacent to politics or culture. PE firms will wait for their retirement or mismanagement to acquire on the cheap. At best, the operation get bolted onto a larger, more stable and diversified entity. At worst, the PE firm raids the revenue streams until the contracts or products reach their end.","","üî• (1)"

Not sure if this is a PLC or network issue, I have updated all of my drivers on the PLC.

We rewrote the code and trained the maintenance staff, decreasing cycle time and downtime durations. 

Though, we didn't change the hardware. 

I have seen initiatives to change PLCs in an effort to reduce the quantity of spare parts needed in a facility or to get everything on one platform for... reasons. This usually doesn't end up working out too well as (contradictory to the story above) us, as some random integrator, rarely know the machine as well as the OEM. Rewriting the code for the wrong reasons usually just ends up with worse code and stunted production.

PLCs are a shift more open compared to the proprietary DCS ecosystems. 

There's a couple forces at play here. The primary actors in control programs are the physical equipment and natural process. The requirements of the program are dictated by these. The programs last years because the equipment and process slowly change if at all. 

The second challenge is that these are custom applications. You can have 5 extruders in your plant and each one is physically different and programmed differently. The market has dictated that this is best solved by low code visual programming developer software. There are similarities in IT with the push towards solutions like PowerApps and other low code or no code developer software. For the most part, IT departments have tried to strip out as much custom applications as possible and pushing toward SaaS offerings to reduce the resources required to support the business.

And for some reason the boss wanted to try and cheap out on this one and see if we could manage w/ a bunch of clearcore's coordinated by a pi. So I didn't have any real clue what I was doing & self taught myself webdev for the UI & python for the line controller & c++ for the clearcores, and it eventually started mostly working. 

Actually the Pi & clearcore's have never had a failure, but the much more expensive arm control units (epson) have failed twice  in 4 years. As have 2 of the 14 tecknic conveyor motors and 2 of the 5 beetronics touchscreens. 

Anyway I got big into start trek lately so I've been working on a reskin for the HMI. Each station has its own touchscreen, and you tap the line model on the right to select which section you are viewing. You can see the currently selected tab is lit up.

I want to add a bunch more animated details to the model. Each dark orange segment is a conveyor, and light orange are elevator segments. Could visualise batches moving along the belt. Stack lights. I'm still trying to think of a good abstrack way to represent the turntable & arm states.

A robust approach is that the manufacturer sets up an Edge device in the Panel and relays the access to you. I would do it with Linux box running node red  or FrameWorx, ir Ignition Edge or similar, but that might not be the manufacturer approach.

If the manufacturer does not want to give you direct access you  ask them for a CC7, it has two ports a device side and can communicate to a Siemens PLC via S7, Modbus or OPC.
It can then Act as an OPC server or Publish to a Broker ont he Cloud Side. Differnt Networks required and you can only program it from the device side.

if the coupler is already confired ask the machine builder for instructions on how to connect,

One last question:
I asked for [1212](https://sieportal.siemens.com/en-ww/products-services/detail/6ES7211-1HE31-0XB0?tree=CatalogTree#overview) but was recommended [1211](https://sieportal.siemens.com/en-ww/products-services/detail/6ES7211-1HE31-0XB0?tree=CatalogTree#overview)
Stating it has all the features of 1212 just with less memory and less module support. And since we are only going to use it for 2-4 machines just for data transfer I have no need of 1212. My only concern is that I might have to add a ethernet module to connect with the internal network of the other two machines when we start working on them and I don't think 1211 supports communication modules... correct me if I am wrong?
Also this is the information shared by the manufacturer there is also a sheet with a description of the 36 bytes mentioned here.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1095026951804170291/1413483386990887023/tmp_6075a586-4d48-49f6-96a4-cc225089f55a.png?ex=68df083c&is=68ddb6bc&hm=b5c1ad68af682b6e2a70b89049a8ab019ea23ce728887ca57ac2f785b2d8429d&",""

But that sort of penny pinching on PLC's drives me insane.

I have done that so many times and put in the least cost technically acceptable PLC only to replace it in a short period of time

I always think it is worth going up a size or two in PLC.I have a big argument with my boss on a 5million dollars plant room wanting to put an L85, instead of an L81. 

It was a few thousand euro in the difference. But I replaced the L81 2years later on another project. I have been burned too many times in that way. Now I just say the smaller one is not acceptable.

from my Siemens page
1211 -235
1212 - 316

For 80 euro I would certainly go with the 1212. 
If I owned the plant I would probably go with a 1214 for 478euro

Well I would go with the G2. The modules will be available in the future it meets your needs now I think and the 1214 is a beast of a PLC for the money.

I would make a list of another 5 problems I could solve over time with it and justify the up spend that way.

Without looking at the manual you can certainly add a modbus 485 signal board.  Not sure what else can be added though. I though I put a comms module on the 1211( back in 2014 so maybe I'm misremembering.","",""

Actually have one on the desk in front of me right now üòÇ @Karsh  Reading through the chat, Mark has already given solid advice as always. My first thought when reading through your initial messages was similar to Mark's -> use a Security Appliance capable of NATing to handle the networking and address translation of the various machines / vendor skids (also set whatever security rules needed) and connect to a Siemens CC716 that you can configure an OPC UA server (it can connect up to 7 PLCs - depending on data quantities). This approach is ""expensive"" and would need some experience setting up the security appliance (not so simple if you've never done it). But based on the chat it looks like the decided approach is that each machine will have its own PN/PN coupler. You are planning to add an additional Siemens S7-1200 to connect to the various PN/PN couplers, retrive the required data, then serve this data to your server applipaction as OPC UA from you new S7-1200.","",""

The 1211 G1 is not only small memory-wise, it's the smallest one in the Siemens range. Please do not under-estimate the required memory load that enabling the OPC UA server capabilities on the older generation of PLCs. Even small amount of data from 2 to 4 machines.
