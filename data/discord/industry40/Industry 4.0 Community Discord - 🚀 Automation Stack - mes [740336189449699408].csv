@Karan I agree with this approach when it comes to MES.  It is a good idea to get the 10,000 foot view of what the customer needs early on, but actually execute  in an agile manner where the customer sees functionality much earlier.  We often find that we have to just show the customer what they need with MES rather than wait for the perfect requirement to come along, this speaks to your comment on working with people on the floor earlier. To @zackscriven's point I agree... manufacturers always have an MES, it is just usually on paper or in excel until they get around to implementing it.","","👍 (1)"

If you leverage the technology that's available correctly, you can accomplish all the tasks of a traditional MES while enabling your organization to be more flexible in its integration. In my previous role, our ""MES"" system was actually a combination of multiple different pieces of software. Our focus was an open architecture that allowed information to be passed efficiently and automatically, between the entire eco-system. We had two pieces of software at the core, Ignition and Argonaut, and between those two pieces of software, data could flow anywhere in the organization. From pulling down work orders from SAP, to passing SPC data to QMS Pro, to even calling an API in our CMMS system to assign maintenance work orders. In our pitches to our clients now, we generally steer them away from locking in to a single MES solution, but instead to think about identifying a business need, and using technology to solve it.","",""

@Miro MES is about the execution of Manufacturing and generally points to the software providing the functions -- work orders, efficiency calcs, product codes, etc.  MOM generally points to the business processes that make up operations and include quality tracking, track and trace, scheduling, recipe management, etc.  MOM is inclusive of all the processes that go into executing your business, MES is generally just the stuff you see MES software  include in their off the shelf solution.","","👍 (1)"

@Jaffar there are many examples -- @RemusPop gave you a good one, Siemens PLM and SAP integrate nicely because of the relationship between SAP and Siemens.  (I also like that Siemens PLM is headquartered here in Dallas).  I've also integrated with Upchain and Teamcenter.  The biggest challenge is mapping IDs in PLM to IDs in the ERP, we generally do this in the namespace.

@RemusPop @Walker Reynolds Thanks Remus and Walker, track and trace is one of the projects we are looking into but with the inclusion of the supplier's system to provide updates on delivery dates and therefore update our in house schedules. This would most likely require setting up API's. We will most likely use Teamcenter to push approved drawings/BOM's into MES and create a feedback loop to raise change requests/non-conformance's etc ... Our ERP/MES is a bespoke system that is rolled up into one, so it makes some things easier. This is just one of the focus areas for our testbed.","",""

@francisco.olano We have used Sepasoft Track and Trace many times -- it is a good solution, not a great one and does not fit all use cases.  However, when we have selected their module for the solution it has been in scenarios where we are already using Sepasoft OEE and Production Modules AND there are few edge cases for serialized events in the PLC (serial and lots number transitions).  We ended up building our own Track and Trace solution in Ignition that we use if we can't get Sepasoft's tool to work for our use case.  The biggest advantage when using Sepasoft?  Is that it is an Ignition module and it has all of the benefits that come with being a part of that platform.  Overall, its a good solution, a lot more expensive than it should be but it is highly effective in the correct use case.","",""

@zackscriven After you implement a MES you end up with a bunch of code that can easily be re-factored for the next project that comes along. In my experience system integrators will pick an MES platform to extend or develop from the ground up their own features, functions, modules etc... to add value where other systems integrators don't. The value in this case can either be the ability to competitively bid projects or offer additional out of the box functionality some MES platforms do not have.","",""

So the integrators can just re-use their own framework and library. Remember, not all the companies have a MES installed but they definetely have an ICS and ERP. Integrators use to bridge the gap.

On the other hand, If an integrator has developed customizable functionality using their own libraries, cutting down on the configuration/integration time, it makes sense for them to offer this solution.

For 10 years of my career I worked both a distributor and a system integration company that used Aveva (Wonderware) products heavily. In my opinion System Platform is a powerful product if you architect the solution appropriately. With regards to the MES offering, years ago Wonderware bought a product called Factelligence which became the core MES product replacing Wonderware InTrack. The Performance offering is the strongest of the three modules, easy to implement on top of an existing system platform application and it offers a strong abstraction layer of line state which other solutions don't have. If you want to know more about this look into how the ""Utilization Capability Object"" is configured. The operations module is very strong from a backend (database) perspective. You can do Material Management, Specification Management, Labor, Bill Of Material, Work Order Management, Routing, Consumption and Production with Traceability, etc.... The difficult part is how these features are configured.  There are literally three different UI's needed depending on the component you are managing. Honestly in the end of most of the implementations done will leverage the API for the configuration and execution transactions. With regards to the Quality module, I have never used it in production I would typically leverage another COTS application like Infinity QS or Northwest Analytics.  In recent years Aveva has moved the MES offering into a ""Model Driven"" development and deployment system that leverages the Aveva Workflow (Skelta BPM) product. Aveva is coming around on pricing with Aveva Flex and I believe different pricing around clients and IO.","","👍 (1)"

@DavidSchultz spot on -- back when I worked for another integrator, a very famous and well respected organization (20xx System Integrator of the year), we had a problem that Ignition was clearly the best solution for -- and it was made very clear that we could not use Ignition, period, or our WW discounts would get pulled.

Project overview excerpts that caught my attention:
""The batch control system directly interfaces with Rockwell Automation’s PhaseManager feature, which provides ISA-88-compliant PLC code within the Studio 5000 Logix Designer programming software. By utilizing PhaseManager, the design of the custom batch control system would require Ignition to interface with the PLC in the same fashion as competing ISA-88-compliant control software packages do. By leveraging PhaseManager and adopting the models and terminology of ISA-88, Vertech ensured that the custom batch control captures the overall spirit of industrial batching.""

MES has a lot of information about the theoretical process (e.g., standard rate, scheduling) and quality.  MES also provides an interface to people.  In my experience, decisions about downtime and quality require human involvement.  It's not always immediately clear how to log events as they happen.  It's not uncommon to have to adjust historical log information.  This can be challenging to model, at least with enough detail, at the PLC level.

On balance, I believe quality is the most ""expensive"" of the three OEE components.  The implications of sorting, rework, shipping defects, material, production, logistics, etc can really erode profitability.  A lot of the QMS business logic and transactions happen at the MES layer.  This obviously can vary by industry or even company.","","👍 (2)"

Question 1 because that will point you to the software and related technology stack to skill up on. Question 2 because the specific requirements may direct you to different solutions out in the market, or look to build your own. From a high level, wikipedia gives some examples of the functionality.

They mentioned that they have a very important meeting on their product's placement in Gartner Magic Quadrant.  I advised them to not take it too seriously.  I mentioned that forward-thinking and successful professionals that deploy MES don't rely on the MQ.  At best, the MQ is taken with a grain of salt.  At worst, it's absolutely worthless.

I started thinking about @Walker Reynolds' take on the Gartner MQ for IoT platforms in the recent Industry 4.0 keynote video.  The ""bifurcation of thought"" thesis was spot on.  The vast majority of the products listed were simply not capable of serving as a core technology enabler of digital transformation for Industry 4.0.  They were mostly IT-oriented products that overlooked the realities of industrial technology.

With regards to MES in the MQ, my take is that it's not really worth even competing many of the ""leaders"".  Many of the products are ""solution-centered"" and built on overly-acquired / overly-recycled tech.  Second, the manufacturers foolish enough to buy them are probably not worth having as customers.  They'll be at higher risk of project failure and will be challenging to retain.  And, there is a good chance they're not poised to survive.

I'd like to ask this forward-thinking community the following:

In general, what role does the Gartner Magic Quadrant play in your technology strategy and investments?

What has been your experience with the leading products in the MES MQ?  What have you evaluated or used?  Are any your preferred solution?  Why or why not?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336189449699408/814732679412580392/Gartner_MQ_MES.png?ex=68df60ef&is=68de0f6f&hm=236c65a9130fe132f7bb246d95c99dbbb5c8792cd7afb76a29a617672004a58b&","💯 (2)"

The graphic implies that the losses are so easy to separate, however, my experience has been that, depending on the use case, the types of losses blur and everyone sees them differently.

I am reaching out to the combined knowledge of this community regarding an MES request for a potential client of mine that I would really appreciate some input on. Some contexts: The client is expanding into a new factory and are looking at replacing their existing MES system (MPDV/Hydra) in the new facility. It is a German company that are doing Discrete Manufacturing (like automotive) including both Component fabrication (primarily machines) and Final assembly (primarily manual processes). They use SAP as ERP and does not have a SCADA system. So far, they are happy with the current MES in their Component fabrication, but they don’t feel they get full value from the system in their Final assembly and therefore wants to look into other MES options. We are in the early alignment phase, so I do not know the underlying details of why they are unhappy with the MES in Final assembly. We also, unfortunately, do not have the mandate to talk a BIG IIoT digitalization transformation. So, my question to you guys is: What alternative MES systems would you recommend as good candidates based on above short intro and why do you recommend it?

A lot of operations will say ""product X is no good"" without putting a good faith effort into making it work.  Usually, they botched the implementation and never put resources into remediating the problems.  Either the MES did not meet the requirements of the plant/process or there exists a poor culture of management and accountability.  It's easier to shop MES than it is to investigate why an incumbent process is not working.

Did they specifically implement the MES for assembly?  Or, did they try to ""fork lift"" an implementation from component fabrication for their assembly operation?  Are they using MPDV's module for assembly (i.e., Assembly Manager)?  If they like SAP for ERP, it might be worth exploring SAP's offerings for MES.

I really like Plex for discrete manufacturing.  The serialized inventory, traceability, and quality functionality are very strong.  It's a very operations-friendly product.  It's actually an ERP too. You could potentially pair it with modules to plan and cost the final assembly operations as well.  I'm almost certain they would like this better than MPDV.

Another suggestion is to explore standing up a SCADA to complement and augment the MES.  Many MES products don't scale and scope well for manual assembly because of their interface.  Their interface(s) are designed for a broad market.  They have all sorts of options to run production and process inventory.  For example, they might prompt users for inputs that are same for each cycle.  In the context of a busy workforce running production, this can be a burden.  It's too transactionally ""heavy"" for the environment.  Consider leveraging a SCADA to streamline the process.  HMI screens could ""drive"" the MES.  Paired with some light automation (e.g., sensors, conveyors, fixtures, vision), a SCADA could really improve the manual assembly process.  Many make the mistake that automation only means robots or a substitute for labor.","","💯 (4)"

Did you look into the ElementTree Library?
https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC79/Parsing+XML+with+the+Etree+Library

While this does not necessarily answer your question, you might be better off bypassing MTConnect all together.  In my experience, useful MTConnect Adapters are like unicorns.  They don't really exist in the real world.  And when they do exist, the implementations are extremely incomplete.  I'll happily trade an MTConnect adapter for a native protocol with good documentation.  The protocols, despite there being many, were never the problem with getting data out of CNCs.  The problem was always the machine builders.  They either chose not to build out logic for data consumption or to limit (i.e., locked machines, unlabeled registers, incomplete documentation) the ability for others to do so.

CNC machine builders mistakenly believe that their implementation of off-the-shelf control platforms (e.g., Fanuc, Siemens, Mitsubishi) is some sort of unique intellectual property.  It's not at all.  In fact, a lot of it is awful.  It's recycled code from many years ago.  In many cases, it's an example of what not to do.  There is a whole industry of tribal knowledge to sell and service this stuff without any real understanding of how it works.  People don't buy these machines for their controls.  They buy them because of their mechanical design, reliability, economics, and availability.  The sooner machine builders can realize this, the sooner more than a paltry ~5% of machine tools industry-wide will be connected to a network for data collection.  There is not a industry that epitomizes ""solution-centered"" greater than the machine tools industry.","","🔥 (2)"

If I recall correctly, it does not require much to build a qualified MTConnect Adapter.  It may be limited to a few basic things like Device/Agent Attribute, On, E-Stop, etc.  This is hardly enough for meaningful digital transformation outcomes.  It can be somewhat comical walking through the floors of EMO or IMTS.  There are exhibitors who proudly tout their MTConnect support, but they barely expose any information in their adapter.

MTConnect Adapter implementations vary by machine builder.  Additionally, they can vary by model.  This is often a function of an asset's native namespace and what was elected to be abstracted.  If the machine builder leverages one of the major CNC automation platforms (e.g., Fanuc, Siemens, Mitsubishi) and follows the reference architecture (i.e., similar implemented namespace), the generic MTConnect Adapters can sometimes provide more data.

I don't have experience building out MTConnect drivers.  I can only bring up what I've observed with the Adapters and Agents.  As for schema, you're probably in good shape if you follow the MTConnect spec first.  There are XML Schema Definition files on the MTConnect Institute site.  Compare these to the Device Doc coming off the Agent(s).  Hopefully, there should not be much variation in schema among Adapters for different makes/models.  The two things I would look out for are versioning and data types.  While likely similar, not all agents are running the same version schema.  Elements have been deprecated or replaced.  Watch the header.  Additionally, data types can be ambiguous as they are implicitly defined by DataItem Categories (samples = numerical, events = discrete).  If an unrecognized tag (i.e., DataItem Type) shows up or something is encoded incorrectly, your parser will need to know how interpret it.  Ideally, the parser should first consume the Device Doc as a basis of interpreting the Stream Doc.","",""

Everything I've seen involving Muratec involves the native Fanuc protocol (i.e., FOCAS) or EtherNet/IP. 

Muratec is notoriously challenging to build a useful namespace out of. They have a peculiar way of organizing memory. Mixed endianness.  Poor documentation. There is a lot encoded and inaccessible in the C level.

On the other hand, some of the solutions represented here were not on this list years ago.  They may have had viable enterprise functionality, but not enough customers with large enterprise deployments.

Many ERP and MES survey results in these reports are skewed by M&A activity among manufacturers in recent years.  If private equity is involved and an exit is imminent, the firm may elect to live with its disparate systems at each site.  Or, their sites may be in different industry verticals or localities that make standardizing on one solution challenging.  Additionally, when an organization does opt to expand an enterprise deployment, they tend to steer towards the more established offerings.  The focus hones in on low risk objectives (e.g., global sales/support presence, bare minimum functionality, reporting, minimize redundant investments) rather than specific functionality to optimize the operation of the sites.  The perceived niche solutions tend to get replaced and, hence, squeezed out from market analyses.

Here's a practical example.  Suppose a conglomerate or manufacturer acquires a mid-size manufacturer in the US running Sepasoft.  Suppose there are other holdings in Europe running MPDV and in Asia running Oracle.  They also have existing investments in Siemens for SCADA.  Additionally, all sites happen to use Dassault for CAD/PLM and SAP for ERP.  What's a CIO pressured for technology cost-cutting to do?  The acquisition's goal was to obtain access to a new market / kill a competitor and cut out redundancies.  They take inventory of everything.  They look at Sepasoft.  They perceive it as another SCADA (being an Ignition module) and there exist fresh WinCC deployments at other sites.  They also can't find anyone who has successfully implemented and localized Sepasoft in Asia.  They quickly decide to replace Sepasoft.  They meet with Dassault, SAP, and Siemens.  Dassault, SAP, or Siemens make an offer they cannot refuse.","","👍 (5),💯 (1),highbyte (1)"

I noticed that Trackhound's Adapter for Fanuc only support 0i and 30i controllers.  Most Murata machines I've encountered have been larger MW series lathes.  They had 18i, 32i-A, and 32i-B controllers depending on their age.  Outside of additional features and axis of motion, I don't know the differences between these controllers and the 0i.  I'm not sure how the registers (aka namespace) would vary from controller-to-controller.

My understanding of most generic MTConnect Adapters for Fanuc controllers is that they scan the F and G registers through the FOCAS Ethernet interface.  The F registers are outputs (commands) from the CNC to PMC.  The G registers are inputs (feedback) from the PMC to the CNC.  This is where most of the standard Fanuc motion control functionality for machining reside.  Most machine builders will use some of this functionality, but not all of it.  Thus, it's common for MTConnect adapters to have missing data.  What data is present is a function of their implementation of Fanuc.  For example, there might be information information present about the main spindles, but not the tooling or workholding.  

To my knowledge, Murata does not have a native MTConnect Adapter and Agent.  There is not an option of selecting what and where the data is published.  The generic MTConnect Adapter will have Fanuc FOCAS addresses (e.g., statinfo_run, F1000.1, G1234) hardcoded in to poll the controller and the publish into the Agent's schema.  The only way to change what is present in the schema is to change the Adapter.  I noticed Trackhound's Adapter was on Github, but it appeared to be compiled.  I didn't see anything that appeared to call up the FOCAS namespace.  You could try modifying one of the other MTConnect adapters.

To change what the agent publishes (i.e., MTConnect namespace), it will requiring changing the adapter looks for in the Fanuc memory tables (i.e., Murata namespace).","",""

Murata and maybe Makino have the some of the most complicated namespaces.  The good news is that Murata's programs are fairly consistent from model to model.  So, once you learn something for one asset, there's a good chance it will be applicable to others.

If I get some time over the next few weeks, I'll have someone run a test on a Murata with the Trackhound Adapter.  I'm curious what the Adapter, built for 0i and 30i controllers, would pick up.  Most of what I have access to would be 32i series controllers.","",""

This is good because the metric is designed to indicate intentional efficiency of an asset.  This is bad because intention can be continuously redefined.  One of the downfalls of OEE is that planned downtime is modeled as ""free"" and anyone can quickly redefine downtime as planned.   Most OEE implementations implicitly model planned downtime (or off) as the simple inverse of running or unplanned downtime.  In practice, this can turn planned downtime into an abused catch-all for ""this doesn't count"".  In the real world, capacity is finite and assets must achieve certain levels of availability to be economically viable.  Downtime is downtime and it has a cost.

There are ways to introduce planned downtime into OEE by using a schedule as a constraint.  It works well in environments with capacity planning issues or poor execution of planned downtime activities.  Examples might include excessively long setups / changeovers or maintenance activity. This technique requires planned downtime to be explicitly defined in the scheduling process.  Any planned downtime activity that occurs outside of its schedule is classified as a form of a unplanned downtime.  So, when availability numbers are low, it's clear that there is a problem with ""unplanned"" planned down activities.  This would be implemented by having the OEE logic source planned production time from a schedule rather than derived from an asset state log.

Another indicator can be normalizing planned downtime hours against running hours or cycles.  This provides visibility into the level of relative planned maintenance activity over time.","","💯 (1)"

Inbound ports is applicable with firewalls, so if there is a PC on level 1, the tradition is that the firewall on that PC should block all traffic that is initialed externally. So if a user is trying to ping or access the list of files shared of three PC, the firewall drops these requests. This policy significantly reduces a hacker's attack surface.

When using MQTT, the Level1 PC initiates the connection to the broker as a client. So from the perspective of the firewall on that PC, that MQTT connection request is outbound. Modern firewalls are stateful, meaning when the PC's firewall detects this  outbound connection request, it will allow inbound traffic that is associated with that TCP session. For example, the PC initiates connection to the broker and the broker responds to acknowledge the connection, a stateful firewall is typically configured by default to allow that inbound response even if its inbound policy is to drop all inbound (initiated) traffic.

Then when it comes to data after the connection is made, such as an MQTT subscription to a topic representing what the order to be processed is, the firewall will allow that data too, since it's still part of the original connection.

This is largely why MQTT fits in nicely with security policies, since to get data to the lower level devices did not require a special exception to the device firewall. Walker refers to this characteristic as""edge-driven"" and is one of his 4 requirements of an IIoT architecture.

All that to say, if Batchmaster supports MQTT, then that is how you could maintain blocking inbound connections and still get data to the lower levels.","","👍 (8)"

Regarding OEE, I was introducing the concept of ""scheduled"" vs ""unscheduled"" planned downtime.  Let's use the concept of maintenance or change overs.  Suppose they're not being managed well and are consistently going over schedule.  It's eating into capacity.  This downtime activity that occurs outside the production schedule would not impact availability.  However, this downtime activity that runs into production schedule would.  It would be classified as a form of unplanned downtime like ""unscheduled PM"" or ""unscheduled change over"".  Unplanned downtime reporting does not have to have one classification.  It's possible to have tiered attributes attributes to define events.  These attributes can, of course, be filtered.

Here's a more concrete example.  Suppose a workcenter is scheduled to be down for engineering trials for 12 hours and is scheduled to run production for 12 hours.  But, the engineering trials actually ran for 13 hours.  The workcenter resumed production 1 hour into its schedule.  This is lost time that can't be made up without additional cost.  So, over a 24 hour period, the workcenter's log would have entries for 12 hours of engineering trials (planned downtime), 1 hour of unscheduled engineering trials (unplanned downtime), and 11 hours of production (uptime).  The availability figure would be negatively impacted by one hour.

The benefit of this approach is that it penalizes planned downtime activity that happens outside of its schedule.  Because the OEE models planned downtime as ""free"", it gets abused.  It can lead to problem of high OEE numbers but low gross output.  Running well when running is not necessarily the same as running well as scheduled.","",""

Yes, the cloud introduces new risks to manage, but many of those can be mitigated and their costs can be offset with benefits.  Many manufacturers take a “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mindset to their apps and slowly decay into irrelevance.  Even when they host it, they barely enhance or upgrade it.  At some point, the decade (or two) of stagnation offsets any perceived benefits of stability.

Worried about connectivity?  Use diverse fiber, backbone carriers, SD-WAN, BGP, MPLS, etc.  Worried about downtime?  Forge an SLA, develop an outage protocol and leverage store-and-forward at the edge.  Worried about security and compliance?  The provider’s SOC reports will rival what most organizations can offer and attest internally.

Cloud is not a hard-and-fast rule, but it’s always worth considering.   It’s not appropriate for all manufacturers.  At the very least, it’s an intellectual exercise that will cause one to reexamine architectural habits and traditions.  When one tries to lift-and-shift to the cloud, they usually are either unsuccessful or they don’t reap the full benefits.  Whether it’s SaaS or IaaS, cloud is different infrastructure and requires a different approach.","","👍 (3)"

Plex has been doing cloud about as long as Salesforce and Netsuite (~20 years).  The traceability and quality functionality very strong.  It’s not an MES for every process, but it’s certainly performant.  In most cases, functionality will drive selection before performance does.  I’ve seen it do everything from deep lot management to large BOM assembly to ultra-fast production processes.  The real limiting performance factor are the stored procedures in the database.  Optimizing API calls goes a long way.  Most implementations I’ve seen in North America can ping the datacenters between 6ms and 40ms.  It works well overseas.  The largest complaint is that, to preserve performance, one cannot execute their own unapproved queries on the production databases.  They must use an API or query on the reporting databases.  This is not necessarily a bad thing and not unheard of in on-prem applications.  It's probably not a good idea to ""SELECT *"" on a live MES database anyways.","",""

Pros:  It’s remarkably fast to deploy.  All customers are running their application on the same code base.  Instead of supporting a sea of disparate versions and customizations, the vendor can better support and enhance the product.  This makes issues easier to reproduce and, hence, fix.  With SaaS, the vendor has more of an incentive to maintain their product to retain their customers.  The whole ecosystem (e.g., vendor, partners, customers) tends to be more collaborative and drive more innovation.  

Cons:  You're married to the vendor.  That's the case with on-prem too, but you're really married when it's cloud SaaS.  There are much more limitations in what can be customized.  You’re at the mercy of the product roadmap.  If it's not common functionality or something beyond what is typically done in the targeted industry verticals, you can run into problems.  This can be mitigated by being less reliant on the vendor for everything.  Having a SCADA that can augment certain MES functionality can help.  As with many things, it pays off to be strategic about what one buys vs builds.  It’s best to build and customize where it’s a competitive advantage.","",""

*The next critical step for the new solution was to figure out a way to drastically reduce the total amount of source code we would have to manage over time. I thought, what if we could store the behavior of our software in the same place our customers store their part data and inventory data? The idea was to store the behavior of the application in the form of database data rather than in the form of source code. The idea of “Customer Settings” was born. All the customers would run off a single set of source code, but we would use the Customer Settings tables to provide each company a custom experience, tailored to their particular needs. Principle #3 would be achieved.

Instead of having multiple versions of our source code floating around out in the world at our customer’s locations, we would have a single set of source code. At our office. Under our control. A meta system. And people would somehow connect to. This would mean that every time we added a new feature or capability to the software then that work would become a permanent part of our solution, not just a one-off customization that we did for one customer, but a new capability that we could instantly share with all our other customers. This was one of the key benefits to the new approach.*","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336189449699408/839026084414226442/file_The_Origin_of_Plexus_Online.pdf?ex=68df6d6e&is=68de1bee&hm=53f1349fb635d99e2970304abd693526235a8585df105552793d0ca915c1ad9f&","👍 (2)"

It's basically a full-suite ERP with the plant-floor operations functionality built out first and then accounting and HR last.  With most ERPs, it's usually the other way around.  The multi-tenancy has no bearing on the size of the customers.  That's just the architecture.

They do have a large base of mid-size manufacturers.  Those were most of the early adopters and oldest customers.  The majority are in the $50M to $500M annual revenue range.  The core verticals are in discrete (e.g., automotive, aerospace, industrial, metals) and some process (e.g., food & bev, chemicals).  Mid-size is definitely a target because there are more opportunities to acquire that business.  This is more of a function of the market at-large and investment cycles driving replacement.  Within the past decade, a lot of large and well-known manufacturers have signed.  There have been two themes here.  First, there are large firms that want to rip out their legacy investments (e.g., SAP, Oracle, QAD, Infor) that have not been delivering enough value for their operations.  The other theme involves M&A, divestitures, or diverse business units.  Instead of a ""big-bang"" replacement across-the-board, the product might get deployed selectively to certain business units.  It might get implemented where it's a good functional fit, fast to deploy, or where it was cost-prohibitive to expand an incumbent solution.  They'll then integrate it with the legacy ERP or a financial management suite running at HQ.  Because it's cloud tech with a consistent data model, these ""hybrid"" or ""two-tier"" ERP models are becoming somewhat common.  Whether it's a $10M firm with one site or a $10B firm with many sites globally, the product scales pretty well.","","👍 (1)"

I've seen some traditional architectures where the PLCs are ""married"" to the MES.  They're so tightly coupled that they cannot run independently of each other at all.  I wonder if this approach, in the long-run, does more harm than good.  It makes things fragile and inflexible.  It can make any change incredibly disruptive.  It's architecture that, as is common in industrial tech, assumes everything will always work and never change.

There are a lot of scenarios in which an MES does not necessarily need to be completely present every cycle.  Transactions can be timestamped and queued or batched.  From a reporting perspective, everything ""feels"" real time even if it's not exactly processed that way.  The more critical moments involve things like setups or loading source inventory.  This information can be made available in a UNS or SCADA at the edge.  The production process can theoretically ""carry-on"", within limits, in between these critical moments.

Is the problem with cloud connectivity or is it the way we architect MES in the stack?  If the architecture is more ""loosely-coupled"" or ""service-oriented"", do the problems subside?","",""

I really like watching you on YouTube. Nice to hear your field experience as well.

You are my best chance to persuade my colleague about what’s cycle time meaning ?

Today I had some tough discussions at my company which is about what should be the cycle time meaning. I like how oee.com describes it on their website but when we look at sixsigma it says a little bit different about it. So my company says we are doing it like what sixsigma says.

In a nutshell, my supervisor says cycle time means you should subtract stopped time and transfer time from all the time passes to produce one part at that station.

However I think it’s not cycle time it’s something like net run time what oee.com says. Cycle time should mean like total time passes to produce one part and should include all the things happened in that cycle.


What’s your opinion ? Do you think there should be more than one meaning what cycle time means at different companies ? Is there any standard for it ?

Thanks in advance,

Within a factory, the switches, routers, cabling, server location would all need to be different for HA. As the network cable entering the facility would be singular, this split has limitations.
That said, Kube can help respond to spikes in data coming from PLCs. So if the CPU spikes, Kube would scale the app across its nodes and everything would just work. It’s not HA but it is scalability. Once you have the CPU and RAM on-site, you will be good in most cases.

Additionally, you can have an aggregate for the whole multi-station line.  This is similar to the way one might have an OEE for a plant or an area of a plant.  It's common to monitor the overall OEE, but then focus on an underperforming station's OEE to make improvements.  This makes it clear where there is a bottleneck or constraint negatively impacting overall performance.

This can happen on multiple PLCs or one PLCs.  It doesn't matter what is producing the data.  What's important is that activity is being tracked to produce the necessary data for calculating OEE.  This might take form of a sensor at every station or even an operator interface.  Even in a manual process without actuators present to ""do the work"", automation can be beneficial playing a more passive role.","","💯 (1)"

In all cases where data is manually generated this is a challenge (even highly automated factories have at least some instances of data and information that is generated by humans and requires manual logging). However, I do believe there are ways to mitigate this. 
Most people tend to blame inaccurate data on operator discipline or non-cooperation. I don't always agree with this. In my experience, the two biggest reasons for inaccurate data collection are 
1) Too much friction in the data collection process - An operator's primary focus is the task at hand and if it's too tedious and distracting for them to log data I wouldn't blame them for resisting. 
2) Wrong incentives - if the person logging the data is going to be appraised based on the values logged, there is a perverse incentive to fudge the numbers. No one should feel threatened. Rather than just being a directive by management, companies should be willing to share in the value generated from having access to accurate data with all stakeholders in the business, especially operators. If its just a one way value exchange between a company and its employees, it will rarely work. 
Would be interested to know others' experiences in dealing with this.","","💯 (4)"

The one hesitation I have is that it does not appear edge driven. You need to manually create the instance of each UDT in your perspective and point it to the IO block and port. This is not scale-able, and is Ignition-centric (builds a wall on a couch - if you replace Ignition, you loose all that work)

IFM does have MQTT support though for some of it IO-Link masters.

He said this has been an ongoing discussion internally and that currently they chose to do it based on a time interval because consistently defining ""change"" for all the available IO-Link devices has been the challenge.

Maybe you can all help enlighten me on this. Using a pressure transmitter as an example: cyclically over IO-Link you get the vendor ID, device ID, pressure (in steps of 0.1 psi) and switching status. It makes sense that the vendor ID, device ID, and switching status would all be RBE. For the pressure though, would you want it to only report the pressure if it changes by the 0.1 psi step? If that's the case, pressure rarely holds that steady so you'd be getting constant reporting anyway. Or do you want to define what ""change"" is for each use case? If so, that would have to be logic built in to the IO-Link master.","",""

Yes, this could be a lot of publishes but it's going to be limited by the polling rate of the IO-Link master. If it polls every 10ms, which would be pretty fast that's still only 100 publishes per second. Yes, this could be an issue if you had 1000's of these but a lot of systems are able to handle 10's of thousands or more publishes per second because MQTT is so lightweight.

Another option would be to have a min time between publishes setting. So everything is RBE, unless it just published, then it has to wait out whatever setting that is.","",""

Each node still serves its purposes.  The only difference is the integration is more practical and less convoluted.

OEE is a very popular feature to offer in automation products.  In a very solution-centered way, it's offered up at all layers of the stack.  Buyers get distracted by flashy dashboards and performance metrics.  They overlook where the data is coming from, how its processed, and whether it can scale across their operation.  I would suspect that more manufacturers are familiar with OEE than what an MES is.

If we think about what an MES is, it's a system of executing manufacturing.  It definitely knows:  inventory processed, inventory rejected/scrapped, workcenter state, workcenter schedule, theoretical/standard cycle times, etc.  It knows these things because it does (i.e., transacts) these things.  If we think about what OEE is, it's a historical representation of what the MES transacted.  Hence, OEE is driven by MES.  While not all data originates in the MES, it does converge to and traverse there to execute production.  Sometimes OEE is a separate app/module and sometimes its a mere report.

Example, often MOs are issued from an ERP which to me seems like more of an MES task. Is this a function of a 3.0 ERP mantra where the bloated ERP is the single source of truth instead of the UNS?

They might offer up modules for specific industry verticals along side their core financial and human capital management modules. In some cases these modules are the result of acquisitions to maintain or expand market share. This creates confusion about what ERP is and isn’t.

Some ERPs creep down the stack. At the same time, some MES (e.g., job shop products) and SCADA apps creep up. Product managers don’t necessarily follow what ISA dictates. They’ll build product they can market and sell. Sometimes this means blurring the lines.

I would say that the role of ERP is not diminished in I4.0. I’d say it becomes more important and more usable. I think what is different is that we’re less likely to see bloated full-suite deployments. First, it’s too hard to successfully implement these “big-bang” projects in a reasonable amount of time. Second, the functionality is not equally good or supported across the board. For example, a module that has been abandoned for a decade is probably not very innovative. 

In the cloud era, best-of-breed has become a reality. With version-less software built on modern architecture, integration is much easier than its been in the past with on-prem. Mixing and matching is much more common. I’m seeing a lot more two-tier ERP for financials, separate HCM, separate CRM, separate transportation management, separate PLM, separate tax engine, separate invoicing by locality, etc than I have in the past. This used to mean a horrible user experience and was horrible to maintain. Cloud and platforms have enabled more diverse app ecosystems.","","💯 (1),👍 (2)"

When the machine stops the PLC code will check active alarms during one program cycle and set an integer tag to a value corresponding that particular alarm. The OEE/Downtime system triggers an event when that integer goes from zero and uses a lookup list to store the correct stop cause. This ensures that you always get one stop cause. 
In cases where more than one alarm is triggered in the same program cycle, the actual order of instructions determine which alarm that will be stored as stop cause. In this way you do have some priority control.

If you calculate OEE individually for each station I believe you don't have to handle the Major and Minor alarms (that combines the stations). If you treat all four stations as one machine and do the OEE calculation on that you will have another situation. If that is the case you cannot really say that the machine has stopped when one of the stations stopped since the others are probably still running. The result of such a situation is a decrease of throughput which the OEE calculation will catch as Performance loss (P). Thus you should log the station alarms as performance losses and I guess that could be done by looking at the individual station alarms. If for example the Major alarms stops the whole machine you can use these to handle stop cause.

If the individual stations are very simple it might not make sense to complicate things but if you want to be able to compare performance between stations you need to handle them as individuals. One important thing to note in your setup is that you will have some dependencies between the stations and the Material Handling Robot. You will have situations where the robot stops and material is queued up and finally causes the upstream stations to stop. Depending on buffers and position of these stations it might happen that they stop independent of each other and if the stop is short it might be that some of the stations does not stop at all. This will impact the OEE differently on the individual stations which will complicate comparison of OEE data. We normally ""pause"" the OEE calculation for a machine that is starved (no incoming material) or blocked (downstream queue) and set the machine state accordingly to visualize in reports. We do OEE calculation on Line level and machine level but we only use the term OEE (not OLE). There are probably a lot of different ways you can do this and I am not really sure what standards tell but the important thing is to create OEE layers that enables you to pinpoint the direction when doing improvements. In your case I would chose individual OEE for the stations. You can also do OEE for the robot and on top of all you can do OEE for the whole cell. This will give you a good granularity. If eg the whole cell is stopped this will trigger a ""blocked"" state for the stations meaning the cell gets the blame🙂 and you will see this in the A of the OEE for the cell. If a station stops you will see this in the A of the station but eventually also in the P of the cell.

We usually will do one of two things --> 1) OEE system will see the down event from automation and the operator will assign a downtime reason from a standardized list. At this point if our system was seeing multiple active alarms, we prompt the operator for ""Fault Association"", and they will pick from list of Faults that were active during the downtime event. Note we typically don't pull these from the PLC directly, rather from a Time-Series Historian that is capturing all the alarms and events on the line.  2) We only use the alarms for further root cause analysis.  Meaning the OEE system collects downtime events and the operator will assign the downtime reason from the standardized list and nothing more. Separately the Time-Series Historian is collected alarms and events from the line.

In reality, there are surprises.  All sorts of real-world variation (e.g., material, environment, people, process) can throw off even the most advanced inspection systems.

Most MES suites will have some sort of inventory, production, or rejection module for handling these sorts of quality transactions.  Any decent MES implementation should have both a programmatic method (i.e., API) and user method (i.e., GUI) for quality transactions.  The latter is especially important.  Depending on the environment, this might consist of some sort of console for someone to ""log"" piece-by-piece (e.g., good, scrap, hold/reject) as production is ran.  Or, if there are is some sort of inspection process that takes considerable time, an interface to good back adjust the records (e.g., X-Y-Z good, Y scrapped, Z on hold for suspect defect) works well.  Either way, the OEE engine will consume this data and calculate accordingly.

Things to look out for:

-If you perform any sort of sorting or rework, have a way in the MES to distinguish between this and normal production.  Otherwise, this could ""muddy"" baseline quality metrics.

-Consider architecting your MES to support ""first-time-through"" or ""first-pass-yield"" metrics.  These are particularly useful metrics for process engineers.  If an organization has particularly low material costs or has supplier quality problems, there is a tendency to undervalue the cost quality and impacts to productivity.  These don't speak ""loudly"" as a line item on an income statement or most quality KPIs.  First-time-through provides visibility into the integrity of a production process.  It makes it clear whether a line is producing product at an appropriate level of quality without any special intervention.","","👍 (5),🔥 (1)"

Some organizations will take the chance on running production while the wait for a verdict from quality.  They likely found the productivity benefits exceed the cost/risk of having a quality problem.  Or, they have their process control in order and can run with a reasonable level of confidence.

My personal preference is to have both real time and lag.  Generally, it's optimal to have transactions happen in real-time.  It's much more realistic for someone to classify something accurately as it's happening than recollect what happened over the past eight hours.  But, sometimes, not all the right information is present.  It can take time to inspect, diagnose, clarify, confirm, etc.","","👀 (1)"

If you don't have inline quality and are re-working the part back through production one option is to run that ""Re-Work Order or Part"" where the machine / process is ""Not Available for Production"" (Un-Scheduled). This would not impact OEE, but rather the Total Effective Equipment Performance measurement over time. Most implementations I have been a part of use first pass yield and allow for a part to be Scrapped or marked for Re-Work some time after it is produced, both potentially impacting OEE in some way.","","👍 (2)"

1. Depends on the data-set. I'm not worried about the transactional/master data, that is stored in dgraph, which scales with sharding. Some performance metrics for dgraph are (here)[https://dgraph.io/blog/post/performance-throughput-latency/] and (here)[https://dgraph.io/blog/post/benchmark-neo4j/]. For time-series data through the graph, yes this could become an issue. It depends on your historian setup as your're at the mercy of the timeseries database. Some additional latency is added as your're essentially proxying that data request through the graph; this is the trade off for single/federated api vs multiple apis

The simple answer on how to include FMEA in MES is through Checksheets from a Control Plan.  Many organizations will create FMEA documents as required, but they will reside in a filing cabinet or a file server far away from those running production.  Often, the only time they're reviewed is during an audit or to fulfill a customer requirement.  I believe the best way to embrace FMEA is by making it ""live"" and operationalizing it into production.  When a FMEA is ""stale"" in a spreadsheet, it will always remain disconnected from the organization.  Engineering will evolve the product, operations will evolve the process, and the FMEA will become more irrelevant.

A strong Quality Management System is best enforced with closed-loop processes.  This means embedding it into engineering and production business processes.  It requires an entirely different mindset of engineering quality into a production process as it is conceived.  This is fundamentally different from making tweaks to a production process or adding inspection to comply with requirements after the fact.

The FMEA should consume data models from the ERP / PLM.  This information will be used to form the basis of all the requirements and failure modes.  Next, an accompanying Control Plan should be built for the FMEA.  This will contain everything detect, control, and remediate the risks outlined in the FMEA.  When it comes time to run production, a Checksheet will represent an instance of the Control Plan.  It will contain all the process control as prescribed in the FMEA and Control Plan necessary to run production.  These Checksheets should be embedded into the MES interfaces.  The MES should require completion of Checksheets based on production events (e.g., setup, tool change, material change, cycles, time).","","😍 (1),🧙‍♂️ (2),🥷 (1),🤩 (1),👍 (1)"

Once the model was complete and the time series was being collected, we started to help them analyze the process issues that were occurring by trapping events, based on time series and applying context to them. As the DB of events grew, the ability to apply advanced tools increased and a path for continuous improvement emerged.

My point? - In your industry, the concept of OEE doesn't directly apply but the underlying premise of the data infrastructure model and the need to contextualize event-driven data is absolutely identical. There is no magic wand to efficiency or CI in O&G. It's just critical thinking and hard work.

One application I have been looking at for the would be running OEE calculations on purified water skids, specifically for the pharma industry.

Availability is easy:  What percentage of the time is the system available when required

Performance shouldn't be too bad:  What is the output based on the feedstock?  I.e., based on ""x"" GPM incoming, we expect to see ""y"" GPM outgoing.

Quality is usually the hardest, but in a regulated industry, this parameter is usually set for the producer, in this case Quality:  <1.2uS/cm@25C, <500ppbC, low micro count, low endotoxin (WFI).  Different facilities can set different levels for themselves, but that's the base per USP.

Using this: A=95%, P=100GPM out (when 110GPM out expected) = 91% Q= 82% (uS/cm: 1, target 0.9, ppbC 11, target 15), OEE = 89%","",""

You just have to make sure that system doesn't conflict with any hard limits.

Also agreed on the multiple parameters, I used an equal weighting in my example, and I believe that might be standard.  That said you could always create a variance with unequal weighting that might work better (i.e. OEEx).

The E in MES is the crucial part. An MES manages Execution, which means organising the materials, people, equipment and time to get things done.

Continuous processes (Mining, Oil&Gas, Cement, Water&Waste Water, and others) have less need for ""Execution"" in a production sense, and typically have other application that manage the ""Execution"" of other tasks like Maintenance and Quality.

When Bianca Scholten wrote the book in around 2007, I was one of the very few USERS in Europe, actually implementing 95 in practice. We took the B2MML schemas and built a SAP-integration in 2001'ish.  I owned the Prod-IT strategy and got a free license to play from our CEO, would never happen to day. 
Next step in that story was  in 2004 to choose an MES system for the 65 sites in Arla Foods, we chose WW between a handfull of the classics at that time. We forced WW development in Lake Forest to structure the Production DB (aka PEM) to 95. Now running on 50+ Arla sites. 
Some friday night in 2006 I came across a new stuff called LightHammer on the web. 10 mins later I had a phone call from a guy called Rick Bullotta, who still impresses me today  .. 
Now, Lighthammer managed to get sold to SAP, before I was ready to buy, so I ended paying a minor fortune to get SAP MII - also now running on 50+ Arla sites. 
Since Arla threw me out in may 2018 (where I started ASTICON.DK), my focus has been on IIoT, however most companies here around in at ""Industry 2.9 .. 3.5'ish"" so I make my bread and butter as MES project manager and IIoT advisory as desert.

Grafana seem quite good for that kind also. And YES, I am in the building of a FIVE-dimensional UNS 😇 . 
1) By this I mean there is the ""Asset or EQUIPMENT model"" - the tree-structure (enterprise-site-area-cell-unit..) which some call the 95 or Purdue model, I think of it as the ISA-88 model, where I think it originated. 
2) Next after Equipment, the MATERIAL model is the most common one ( material-IDs, classes, uses, shift-over matrices etc etc). 
3) To keep track of your BOM/Recipes, you need the DEFINITION model, defining the Formula=BOM=which material go into your product,  PLUS the Recipe-procedure (describing the step of the work to be done, PLCwise or manual).  
As we now, know our stainless steel, materials, recipes - we can start receiving orders from our dear customers ..
4) To actually get something produced in your plant you need, what I call the ORDER model, the production plan you get from some ERP-heaven above, the breaking down into batches (or: if you are producing ""discrete"" , into work orders etc etc. ) . In 95 this is the Request model (the requested plan) and the Performance model (the actual produced...)
5) Finally the always forgotten model:  The PEOPLE model (defining users, groups, access, capabilities, track-of-training, cerficates etc.) So far I have avoided this, but IF you are in Pharma it does make sense to document if the operator is capable ....
With these 5 model, your UNS can ""produce anything from milk to moon rockets"". Enjoy the friday when you wake up over there. (I am GMT-2 zone, 🇩🇰 )

That's a big thing in improving overall OEE is determining what the machines are actually capable of running.

There is still a lot of miseducation about ERP systems. Today, I encountered a control system shop, which is supposed to be automating the manufacturing industry, is running on some very strange product from Exact that I have never heard of and they seem to be happy. LOL.

I would argue the EAM product makes much more sense in the Infor portfolio than Hexagon's.  I don't know how Hexagon could manage or sell the product better.

I recognize Hexagon has been trying to reinvent itself as a ""manufacturing intelligence"" company to stay relevant in these I4.0 times, but their track record of integrating acquisitions has been spotty.  Having worked with and integrated Hexagon's core metrology products for years, I'm increasingly puzzled by the rest of their portfolio.  They're often very ""solution-centered"".  They create a lot of standalone functionality that is redundant or not interoperable with everyone else a business may have.  It's a very siloed approach.  And in many cases, the products can be inferior.  Perhaps they're targeting smaller organizations with ad-hoc processes that may not have stood up applications (e.g., QMS, MES, EPR, PLM).","","👍 (2)"

You are right with your assessment that Hexagon takes a very siloed approach and that's where EAM was a fit as it was sold in a lot of competing ecosystems such as SAP and that were not core manufacturing such as transportation, utility, O&G, etc. The other solutions that are manufacturing and industrial heavy such as LN and CSI already had a lot of this functionality and fully integrated with the core ERP. So rather than maintaining two different codebases, it would make more sense to grow the existing codebase within CSI and LN and fill the massive MES hole with LightHouse acquisition. On the other hand, now Hexagon can sell a lot more when they are going to couple EAM capabilities at the plant level, similar to what Rockwell is doing with FiiX and I believe they bundle another quality product with it, which is standalone too.","",""

And most business consulting and project management firms have very little clue on technology, architecture, and the underlying systems. 

This is the major reason why these implementations fail. 

And the blame typically goes to the integrator. 

Most software implementations require aligning on the people, process, and technology. But it's hard to find a company that has mastered all 3 equally well along with more than 15 systems involved in the architecture. 

The more you implement, the better you get. 

Most people who have figured out the formula for success try to implement the system on a piece of paper first before they code anything. Now the developer community might argue that isn't that against the agile principles? Well, Agile never said that you should be skipping the key phase of requirement gathering and design. You should iterate where it makes sense. Agile was never meant to create a bunch of stories and start coding. This is especially relevant for systems where you don't have access to the code such as MES or ERP. They require far more time in the requirement gathering, process re-engineering, and data cleansing phase than the traditional software dev projects.

If there are compliance or industry requirements involved, exercise caution.  For a system integrator, this might be viable if the solution could be productized across a customer base.  Avoid reinventing the wheel.  Life cycling software is non-trivial.  For a manufacturer, even with a staff of developers, extending and integrating an off-the-shelf solution can create enough work to go around.

Here's my script for shopping:  Don't take the analyst community too seriously (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, LNS).  They're more like affiliate marketers than advisors.  Go through in-depth technical demos.  Avoid getting distracted by shiny dashboards and gimmicks.  Ask what's happening behind the scenes.  Get an understanding of the assumptions and limitations of the product.  What you see may not necessarily be reproducible in your own environment.  There will be a degree you must commit to their business process or vice versa.  Spend time with customer references.  Don't be afraid to look for dirt.  Do the firms that have had successful implementations bear a resemblence to your own?

Objectivity and transparency can be tough to come by when a firm stands to gain from you signing with a particular solution.  While it can be hard with closed ecosystems (i.e., ""certified"" partners), look for independent firms to assist with selection and implementation.  Having incentives aligned makes all the difference.  This is especially important if this is a new experience.  It's also not a bad idea to find a mentor in a similar industry that has gone through the process.  They can provide candid advice on what is and what isn't realistic.

When focusing on differences, how do you balance broad vs deep capabilities?  Absent some very specific requirement that constrains the options, this is something I've found to be challenging.  It, of course, becomes more clear with hindsight in phase 2 or 3 implementation scenarios.  Provided it's not junk and can be reasonably adopted, initially, I've leaned towards broad out of caution.  It's nice to have a tool that an entire organization can use but, at the same time, does not merely scratch the surface.

Just because you are buying packaged software, it doesn't give you any discount from the requirement and design phase. Also, most people don't understand how difficult writing these requirements are. Most requirements that we get from our clients after they have spent more than 6 months are typically not even close to what we like to see. They are either too generic or fancy wish lists without a clear understanding of how software design and architecture are supposed to work considering the constraints of all packaged software involved.","",""

This is where we get a lot of ammunitions to negotiate with the CEO and the board either ""you are crazy to DO this"" or ""you are crazy to MISS this.""

Here is the classic, politely speaking, requirement TRASH, that we get from directors of sales, marketing, Ops, finance, CEOs, even IT directors or CIO at times.

This will enable you to make more informed and sound decisions even if there is a high likelihood you will coalesce around an Infor solution.

First off, if MES requirements are only OEE and asset state, it might be worthwhile ""stretching"" a SCADA to fulfill these requirements.

Infor generally has strong functionality for various manufacturing verticals, but it's far from the only option.  It's important to assess how this MES will fulfill your requirements.  While consolidating as much as possible into the ERP is a worthwhile endeavor, do they know how feasible this is?  What do they intend to do if there isn't a good ""home"" for a critical business process?

There's some natural synergy here.  Infor's ERP and MES offerings will have complementary data models.  They're intended to be sold and implemented together.  But, that's ultimately an assumption.  Why?  In the real world, there is variation.  The ERP in place might be older version that does not integrate [well] with the the latest MES version.  It may have been implemented on a narrow budget for a narrow scope (e.g., accounting and hr only).  It might have an incomplete data model to interface with an MES.  The implementation partners may need to be called back to finish the job.

If you do opt for Infor, you'll likely have the solution ""sit"" under the ERP.  Infor's native integration will likely exceed what you could build out on your own.  This will provide a consistent user experience and security model.  It will also yield less surprises.  Straying from this from this should be reserved for unique and differentiating use cases.

Infor has web service interfaces that will expose various transactions (e.g., inventory, assets, boms, scheduling, production).  The UNS, through an IIoT or DataOps platform, can call up these services to indirectly exchange this data to other nodes in the ecosystem.","",""

**Native integration**
If the ERP and MES have complementary functionality and turn-key integration, it's worthwhile leveraging this.

[ERP] <- native integration via APIs or shared database -> [MES]

**UNS Integration**
As there is more to your business than just ERP and MES, you'll need a way to exchange this intelligence elsewhere.  Leveraging a UNS will provide a consistent data model for your business to consume and produce.

[Broker] <- MQTT -> [IIoT Platform / DataOps] <- HTTP -> [MES]
[Broker] <- MQTT -> [IIoT Platform / DataOps] <- HTTP -> [ERP]
[Broker] <- MQTT -> [IIoT Platform / DataOps / SCADA]
[Broker] <- MQTT -> [IIoT Platform / DataOps] <- native -> [Other]
[Broker] <- MQTT -> [Other]

**Solution shortlist**
Ignition, Factory Studio, or HighByte could serve the role as IIoT Platform / DataOps / SCADA.  This will orchestrate the integrations and UNS.  This could even be ""bridged"" to other integration solutions you may have in place (e.g., iPaaS, Infor OS).

As far as MES, there are a lot of options.  Depending on the future role of your Infor ERP, you could even look into the manufacturing-focused ERP (providing MES functionality) in parallel.  I would advise ""kicking the tires"" at Infor, Plex, SAP, QAD, Accumatica, Kennandy / Rootstock, etc.  Personally, I'm biased towards cloud as I'm not fond of upgrades and lifecycling.  I'm sure others can chime in with their preferred solutions.  In short, become an educated buyer and determine how these these could fit into your requirements.

As discussed earlier, there is a possibility a platform (e.g., Ignition, Tulip) might be able to fulfill the requirements.  You could leverage a module (e.g., Sepasoft MES in Ignition) or roll your own.  The important thing here will be the scope.  If it's too big and requires too much customization, it will be too hard to stand up and support.","","👍 (2)"

Before I respond to your inquiry, I did a little bit of research about you, your team, and your company. Before you do anything, the first thing you might want is to find the product name from Infor and the version. Also, who is hosting it? You might actually burn yourself by looking at Infor marketing material. The reason for that Infor still carries way too many products and their marketing team struggles with how to do this in the most simplified manner. 

Based on my understanding of your company, this PDF is absolutely irrelevant for you, unless you are running Infor LN, which is very rare to see in a small shop like yours (I am assuming that you have your current company highlighted on your LI profile). This MES is nothing but a partnership agreement between Infor and FORCAM’s industrial IoT solution. Infor LN may have a little bit of out-of-the-box integration available, but for the most part, it might be implemented for very large accounts, which might be meaningless for you. Again, it's very hard to predict what they might have unless we start digging into the message-level capabilities of each integration point. 

My assumption would be that you either have Syteline, Visual, or one of the old versions of BAAN. This MES capability would not be relevant for these systems as the PDF is specifically targeted for Infor LN.

Once you have that down, document all your needs, especially the business drivers, on why you are doing whatever you are trying to do. Then document the to-be state with each of the old systems identified, their roles and responsibilities documented in the new state, and then assess how each of the MES systems you highlighted would help you accomplish your goals. 

Identify the systems that are pre-integrated with your new architecture and do a solid gap analysis of each of the combinations. How much dev? How much integration? How much testing of the existing process flows as when you touch a wall in your house, you are likely to bring the roof down if not planned well? Once you have that down, then analyze which would be the cheapest and least risky path that your executives might be able to chew. 

Or your project might always remain a dream.

Basically, these decisions are not as binary as you would think. We are talking about the interconnectivity of very, very complex systems. So it can't be Ignition vs FactoryStudio. It has to be what's most relevant based on your budget, size, and systems in your current architecture.","","👍 (2)"

Even though Infor might be commercializing some of the products as their own, it does not mean that they will always be complementary. Even the acquired products may never get the common data model or be integrated as other mainstream products due to the lack of market and revenue share and therefore lack of funding in supporting those products and integrations.

Even if you opt for Infor, the products are likely to be integrated as you would integrate a third-party product like Ignition. So it will feel as if it's a different product. Not all add-ons or integrated products will be buried inside ERP as the native functionality.

Also, keep in mind that while Infor OS looks technically very strong on paper, it's one of the most poorly documented iPaaS with very little training available for developers. In fact, when you raise these questions to Infor support, they will struggle to answer as well. While Infor OS is free and bundled as part of the product, you get what you pay for. Infor ERP products are the only ones that have really great training and documented screens etc. 

As long as, you have clear boundaries of the systems and not overengineering any of the systems or integrations and integrating with APIs, etc, you should be able to integrate a third-party MES system or find something that is already pre-integrated.","","👍 (1)"

YES, is it relative just-go-do to collect data & stack them in a purdue-tree-structure somewhere.  BUT, the real hard work in the plant floor is the ""E"" in MES == Execution and realtime coordination across dozens of PLC/devices. Order/recipe/batch control with automated processes - mixed with manual workflow operator processes. 
This execution part of MES ""being close to and integrated with the SCADA/PLC control - THIS is the heart of the factory - cannot ever stop working.

The source of truth belongs to the operational repository that are controlling your transactions. For products etc, it might be ERP. For customers, sometimes it could be CRM.

There are a lot of layers to his commentary, and some of it could be confusing the way you guys are using terms such as ""data warehouse"" and ""source of truth"" interchangeably.

 Source of Truth (SOT), and System of Record (SOR) in great detail. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-system-record-source-truth-santosh-kudva/

Traditionally (speaking in lay terms), you had two databases due to the limitations of database technologies: 1) OLTP 2) OLAP. Even today, the fundamentals are the same when you have multiple systems in the architecture as the system of record, unless you are using some of the technologies such as Snowflake that might NOT require moving your data to a different database before you could use them. Even HANA from SAP seems to claim to do this that you no longer require OLAP in the architecture. While it can help with superior embedded analytics as part of transactions, I have not seen OLAP to be completely gone with HANA. Also, just a little bit of caution, while I understand Snowflake at a conceptual level, I have personally never been involved with implementations utilizing Snowflake in the architecture, so I am not entirely sure how the architecture would work in practice.","","👍 (1)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2021-12-16T09:55:09.6360000+08:00","Now let's review the role of OLAP and OLTP. The whole idea of OLAP was to move data to a place in the flattened structure where it's easier to consume for analytics or reporting. Some companies even convert this into the NoSQL data structure as it is friendlier for reporting, and you don't require the same degree of transactional integrity in the OLAP database as you would in OLTP. Also, OLAP was created to avoid any performance issues with your OLTP datastore. Even if your OLAP goes down, who cares? It's not as important as your OLTP database as it is not affecting your transaction processing. Traditionally OLAP has always been delayed, and even today, most companies don't require real-time reporting. They are fine with near real-time. But they can't afford to have their OLTP go down as that would mean that they are not able to book sales order, not able to create production order, not able to pick/pack/ship, and finally not able to cut the invoice--which is typically the bread and butter for most companies.

Now when you claim that ERP as a data warehouse and technologies such as Power BI and Tableau are helping with a source of truth, you are almost implying that you are talking about the analytical side of the problem. While you need the complete object for both transaction processing and analytical reporting, as far as the scope of integration goes, the source of truth for the analytical data warehouse is irrelevant.","","👍 (1)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2021-12-16T09:56:51.5900000+08:00","Now let's talk about the source of truth for transactional processing. This is where the pool is WAY deeper in getting the transactional consistency and integrity across the systems as more systems you have in your architecture that are likely to keep fragments of your business objects, the more planning you need to do in terms of which system is responsible for keeping which bit of information and which one to trust when there is a conflict. 

The more systems you add to the architecture, the more failure points you will have, the more work the systems need to perform during the transaction, which will delay the cycle time of your core transactions. It might mean sales orders taking 2x to close or to release a production order as it needs to do more work in combining the fragmented bits of information and reconciling before you have the state of a business object that can be trusted to process your transaction. And once you have updated your transaction, if there are any changes to the core object and you again need to go back to each system and ensure the business object is updated in each system to ensure transactional integrity in the next transaction. While this might appear easy on paper, it gets really hard when you have multiple systems hitting millions of transactions and trying to get the attention of your transactional system. Once you have a queue built up, even because of one issue, most other systems will start failing, and the problem might become even worse.","","👍 (1)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2021-12-16T09:58:29.6360000+08:00","This is why it's always important to minimize the system footprint as much as possible and reduce the number of systems that touch your core transactions in any shape or form. This is also the reason why 50% of the market share of enterprise software vendors is still controlled by the ERP vendors and ERP install base, and it is growing at an exponential rate. While SAAS applications are great and have a role to play, the integrated SAAS applications being used as core ERP or for transaction processing will never work in practice. 

By the way, this is exactly what Infor (that you seem to hate) tried to do in 2002 and that you are trying to champion in 2022. The whole premise of Infor was that I am going to get a bunch of really sharp financial people from private equity and going to buy every SMB ERP and point solution and will try to offer packaged and integrated applications served by Infor OS. Well, this is great, but when you are going to get integration and design issues due to SOT conflicts, there is only so much Infor can do. While Infor has come a long way in testing their integrations and are one of the best, the experience will never be the same as you would get from products that were designed from scratch and that rely on the database layer for reconciliation like SAP, Acumatica, or Plex as opposed to the integration/no-code layer. This is exactly what other enterprise vendors are doing right now. They are trying to create pre-baked integration using some sort of iPaaS either owned by them or through a third party, whether you talk about Epicor, ECi, IFS, or Aptean.","","👍 (1)"

I'm reaching around in the dark.  But, I figured I'd jump to induce more conversation.  I'm looking into this because I've gotten very curious about this platform.  It comes up more and more.  I have not figured out a clear idea what its role is alongside a well-implemented SCADA, MES, and ERP.  

Here's how I would approach this historian question.  First, I'm surprised something like this does not exist natively and why an external historian is required.  I would imagine this would counterintuitive and source of friction for the intended demographic of tulip.  The Tulip's Edge IO interface product has use cases of logging analog inputs similar to the way a PLC and SCADA would.

Does the 'Digital History Record' module meet your needs?  If not, why?  Is it a relational backend and not performant for time series data?

Tulip apparently has MQTT, SQL, and HTTP interfaces.  If you had to hook up a historian, you could probably do it a few ways.  Without knowing all the details of how the data acquired, I will assume the process value has made it's way into Tulip (even if it's not necessarily required that it originates there).  You could have Tulip publish the value to a topic in an MQTT broker.  A historian, such as Canary, could subscribe to the topic and historize the process values.  To review the data, Tulip's SQL client could query the time series through Canary's ODBC connector.  Alternatively, Tulip could probably read/write to Canary via Canary's HTTP-based APIs.  Lastly, it would be a question of how/where to display the time series graphs on a Tulip screen.","",""

It's a fairly young company and is still going through some growing pains. For instance, for analytics you can choose machine state data or application/table data, but you can't mix data from the two. I believe this is primarily because the machine data table is a noSQL (MongoDB perhaps?) and the application tables are SQL based. There are plans to unify them but it hasn't happened yet in version 6. Maybe by version 7 approximately a year from now.

Also, it doesn't support MQTT directly and I've called them on this before. I believe they are claiming MQTT via Kepserver which is what almost everyone uses to collect machine data from CNCs and PLCs, etc. And it's really ""one way"". Tulip uses OPC/UA to suck in everything from Kepserver. 

I think we really need to understand what the OP meant by saying ""integrate"". You could have Canary or Ignition or Factory Studio or <insert platform here> get the data from Kepserver the same way Tulip does. If you're talking about data collected from within Tulip which is part of the main data tables, things get a little more tricky. You can use the NodeRed query nodes but I think you're limited to 100 records per query, probably the same via the REST interface.","","👍 (1)"

These are some major limitations.  But, I can see why the product is successful.  It looks a hell of a lot of easier to stand up and use than a SCADA and MES.  The UX looks great.  It looks like it solve a lot of practical problems in manufacturing.  It would be cool if something like this were embedded into one the major MES products.

On the ISA88/95 synch.  – Yes I agree with @RickBullotta – the short answer is “ask Dennis Brandl” who is man in the middle of both standard efforts, still today, 25 year later.
Just these days, there is a call by ISA for people who want to look into a revision of ISA88, so if you have the time and the patience it takes .. (I don't)
My view of ISA88: 
It has two equally important parts:  
A)    The automation/PLC module structure:   UM – EM – CM (unit, equipment, control module).  I think more or less every PLC-program in the world follow this structure anyway, as its just common good sense. This way of thinking – including the sequences & state machines, typically built into the equipment modules – this is useful in ANY automation, not just in batch processes. 
B)    The Recipe/Batch part of ISA88 which defines very clearly Formula(=BOM) and Recipe procedures: This part is quite closely adopted in the Batch “engines” such as Emerson, Siemens, WW-Inbatch etc.. Not so many sites use this part, and this is the part overlapping to ISA95 by the way.. 

When I started the DT at Arla Foods  in 2002’ish, I realized that out of 65 factories, only a handful of had the business complexity, demanding a full blown Batch-execution system. So I let these few sites in peace, to run with Inbatch and similar batch engines, already in place. In favour to help the other many sites having nothing..
From 2005-18, where we implemented 50+ sites with MES, I went for the ISA95 model. As we had chosen Wonderware MES as the platform, all I had to do was convince WW to develop a 95-structure MES-traceability database. 
The solution (still in play on all sites and kept updated), is collecting order/batch/traceability data in uniform way – easy to pass on to SAP.
We had to build our own Recipe system on top of WW platform, so we made a 95-structured Recipe database with segments, material and equipment specs etc..","",""

Actually we built most of the MES components. You will end up with a lot of code anyway, so choose a MES/IIoT system, that allow for decent (.net/python) coding, NOT proprietary “scripting language” 

NB: The batch engines are really clever applications and often very clean ISA88, but they are rare animals, here in Denmark there would be 5 guys, competent in Inbatch, choose something more mainstream .. 
I don’t know if this makes sense or not – so back to the start of this post – I do think, we should have a youtube with Walker and Dennis Brandl on the call. @zackscriven","","🔥 (3),👍 (1)"

It also automagically created your S95ish plant model for you in Plant Aps.

The source of truth is relevant for each data set. And  the datasets could belong to any of the departments. Then you have operational/transactional datasets and analytical datasets, which tend to behave differently. The people who only worked on the analytical layer seem to think that the transactional layer doesn't matter at all. And just because the analytical layer might be slightly easier to program and could be faster, it's by no means a replacement of the transactional layer. In the traditional sense, we had two datastores, OLAP and OLTP, which both served different functions.","","👍 (2)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2022-02-16T19:10:09.6480000+08:00","And they both were required in the architecture. Keep in mind though, your OLAP doesn't exist, until you have your OLTP down. So the source of truth is far more important in the OLTP layer than in your OLAP layer. Sometimes, they might share the source of truth. But since your OLTP layer is doing the heaviest lifting in the org, you want to make sure you are treating it super well and not overloading it with the unnecessary workload.  You want to remove the study as much as possible from your core transactions. Remember, while a little bit of reflection and strategy may be required during the game, you don't want to be studying during the game.
That brings me to the point that you might want to think of this as if preparing for a game vs actually playing the game. While preparing is imp, it's not as imp as the actual game. Just because the prep might feel easy and you might be allowed to be a little creative, it's not a replacement for the actual game itself. 

Yet another way to think about it would be to think of insert vs select statements in SQL. They both serve different purposes. The insert would be more of your transactions and select would be more analytical or study layer.","","👍 (1)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2022-02-16T19:29:07.0230000+08:00","Now to your point about where Snowflake fit in the architecture.

Traditionally when you think of OLAP and OLTP, you needed to move data from your operational datastore as it would overload the operational system, which is a big no-no in the enterprise architecture. So, what companies did is that they moved the data to a quieter where no one may be watching them, flattened the data for analytical needs as the analytical dataset doesn't need to be as relational. Some companies even converted it into the NoSQL datasets as that's designed for faster analytical processing, but by no means is it a replacement for the relational or operational data store. And then they put a lot of data science/AI/ML on top of it to get the trends and insights they needed from data. 

Now to transfer this massive data in a batch form without bothering your operational system as much, you needed a tech that was designed for bulk data move that could work during the night when everyone else was sleeping and operational datastore was not as angry as it would be during day time. And this is where ETL played the role. ETL was a gold mine for SIs like Accenture or IBM, as while the ERP implementation etc might last for a few months or years, the ETL and analytics layer has far more unique needs for each company. So they literally camped out inside the company to build data warehouses and ETL layer.

Now the only thing Snowflake has changed in the architecture is that you don't need to move your data from the source as its tech didn't affect the operational data store as much as the traditional databases. So now with Snowflake, you don't need the ETL layer anymore (at least, technically), which is a huge cost saving for the companies and that's why Snowflake is such a massive hit.","","👍 (1)"
"873027867515162624","samguptawbsrocks","2022-02-16T19:45:08.7420000+08:00","I like to think of UNS as ""rich people's problem"" as at least I have not seen the good, bad, and ugly from the architectural standpoint. So, unfortunately, I don't have enough data points to be able to comment. But the overarching concept of UNS is not new. Traditionally, there have been three ways of performing message-based integrations 1) synchronous/point-to-point 2) asynchronous but still linear 3) event-based architecture. 

The event-based architecture exists even among most programming languages and most enterprise systems nowadays as linear processing is rarely enough to accommodate today's business needs. If you pay attention to .Net or Javascript, they all support events. Traditionally only front-end technology supported event-driven programming as the backend didn't need to be as dynamic. But things changed and now most programming languages support event-driven programming backend and front end.

Just the way, programming languages would support these events INSIDE a system, the idea of event-driven integration is similar but it's outside the system boundaries. And it's designed to integrate the systems and not to build the system. When you talk about the integration of transactional/operational systems, ETL is not a right fit as it's designed for bulk data movement from database to database. iPaaS would be the right fit to connect all your transactional/business systems but it's not going to have message-driven capabilities as it's designed to be very asynchronous and linear in nature. This is where a lot of systems such as Tibco Business Events played the role as they provided that event-driven glue to connect all different systems. But as the name reads, the idea here  was for business events. The purpose of it wasn't for the operational events.","","👍 (1)"

It also connects hardware. So obviously, that's far bigger in scope than any business events technology. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to predict where this all will land, and if we will ever have SuperUNS or operations folks taking over the enterprise. 😆  But as far as my understanding goes, they all will co-exist in the architecture as they all have a role to play. But the scope of UNS would be limited to the operational datasets and not to the enterprise datasets. Operational datasets are typically too-much-information at the enterprise level.","","👍 (1)"

MES is running a production (and associated) departments.  As the name implies, it's for executing the production plan.

-Production activity gets recorded with an MES

-Repair activity for machines is managed with the CMMS/EAM

I would love to know a little bit about the source of truth in this architecture and what datasets will be flowing back and forth between systems:

If the source of truth is ERP for the core inventory datasets, MES might process the inventory as it moves through the production process. But managing inventory inside MES. Are you serious?

-Repair activity for machines is managed with the CMMS/EAM
Agreed. So what datasets does EAM consume from ERP when not pre-integrated as these are financial assets that must be managed inside ERP?

-A catalog and inventory of spare parts will be in the CMMS/EAM
Are you talking about just the MRO items or anything else? The core inventory must be stored inside ERP.

-The list and progress of scheduled production (e.g., work orders, jobs, kanban) will be in the MES
Agreed. Yes MES will consume the job orders and schedule from ERP and process as instructed by the ERP.

-Managing a changeover on a line will be done with the MES

Rushi is a student learning about manufacturing technology.  This wasn't a detailed discussion on architecture and integration.  Generally, I prefer full-suite ERPs for the very reasons you asked those questions.  It has superior module-by-module integration.

I was trying to illustrate the point that one might work with core inventory in an MES, but definitely not in a CMMS.  Some MES firms offer inventory management modules.  It's usually not full-blown capability of well-known WMS or manufacturing ERP solutions.  I've seen these used in the context of meeting specific traceability requirements that an incumbent ERP may not.  In an ISA95 context, you're right, this is technically level 4 and ERP.  But, in the product marketplace, the lines between MES/MOM and ERP offerings can be blurry.

Regarding spare parts, yes, I was referring to just MRO.  Maintenance applications will often have their own inventory management system.  In a full-suite ERP context, I've often seen maintenance modules ""share"" with the same inventory engine that might also manage supplies consumed in production.","","👍🏻 (1)"

- Quality Management - When the MES is the source of recipes, monitoring the process to ensure it stays within acceptable quality limits, and managing the workflow of quality deviations.
- Inventory Tracking - Creating the links between actual raw materials used and the batch/lot/unit produced on an order, along with the time-series process conditions that the order was produced under, and any exceptions or deviations that may have occurred while that production order was being produced.

In general, it's easier for software firms to ""expand"" than it is to ""land"".  It's lower cost to capture incremental revenue with complementary products from an existing customer than it is to forge a new relationship all together.  This is especially the case at the lower end of the market where manufacturers may not necessarily have a holistic approach to their technology and business processes.  They may be content automating one thing and leaving everything else as ad-hoc manual processes.  They either don't know better or they're not at a scale where inefficiencies are apparent yet.  If they don't elect to stand up disparate point solutions without an integration strategy, they'll seek an offering that can be bundled with something that they have.  Either way, the goal will be low-cost and low-sophistication.

This is why there is a lot of ""shop floor"" software with all sorts of modules that may not be necessarily classified the way an integrator or architect would.  They're marketed to family businesses.  This is not a market that specs ""I need best-in-class technology to architect and run my business processes at Level 3 MES/MOM.""  In reality, the idea is to market a ""one-stop shop"" for everything a smaller firm may need regardless of how well it actually works.

There was so much redundancy.  It got to a point where each complex implementation would involve copying a favored config and then customizing it to the customer requirements.  It was absolutely insane sorting out the differences.

A lot of times this is driven by customer requirements/customizations instead of a product management function consolidating the requirements into a manageable of set of extensible configurations.  Order management is something that always seems to be treated as an overly unique requirement, but I think part of the issue is customers don't necessarily convey requirements similarly and those that implement don't pick up on the patterns.  There is a tendency to constantly reinvent the wheel.  It takes a lot of experience and exposure to different verticals to avoid this.

I have been part of multiple MES systems but my first experience was the most interesting. It functioned as a full fledged ERP/SCADA system. It was called TotalTrac and was on the java platform and had a SQL backend. It did everything from receiving product through shipping and invoicing. At the end of every month, it would create a flat csv file that was sent to accounting for upload into Microsoft Dynamics. It had barcoding on the shop floor and recipe control.

There are scores of L2 PLCs (different vendors/OEMs) which too often require different message structures - and sometime different protocols.

This is about the same for OPC-UA or really any other protocol at the MES or ERP layer.  Even B2MML.  Most the integrations are native HTTP-based APIs for various methods (e.g., add inventory, record production activity, log asset event).  Most of these IoT protocols are for telemetry.  This works reasonably well for a dashboard or a historian, but not necessarily an MES.  Most MESs do not intake raw data, but specific transactions derived from raw data.

Sure, SAP has some OPC-UA interfaces.  But, almost no one is going feed ""Data Access"" straight off of PLC tags into the MES or ERP.  It's huge misnomer that an OPC-UA device sitting at the Edge is plug-n-play with SAP.  The data is going to be acquired and contextualized with a SCADA or integration platform before any transactions happen.  Most demos I've seen involve method calls.  What these demos don't disclose is that they require elaborate reprogramming of the asset's controls and development of very bespoke OPC-UA Servers and Clients.  It's significantly more work than having a modern SCADA or integration platform execute API calls based off of tag values coming from assets.","","💯 (3),👍 (1)"

I personally would gather data in range of 1-5min to longer cycle times in MES. Today we  focus on relevant performance data for OEE calculations (Production) and HACCP  data for enabling SPC functionality (Quality) within MES.

Other process (and faster) data for Root Cause Analysis (for process, opex, reliability engineers,...) would go to a dedicated historian with good trending tools.

I would say Plex would not be in conflict with any Siemens standardization efforts.  There are end-to-end Siemens, Mitsubishi, Fanuc, etc automation shops that use Plex as their ERP and MES.  Plex is exposed through HTTP-based web services and ODBC.  MQTT support is on the roadmap for the Asset Performance Management (ex-DATUS) product.  The native protocols associated the automation products of Rockwell or Siemens (e.g., CIP, S7) are largely irrelevant in this context.  In nearly every case, native protocols get normalized as OPC tags through Kepware, Ignition, Tridium Niagara, etc.  In substance, the only Rockwell part of Plex is the ownership.  Whether you have a plant full of ControlLogix or S7-1500, they're largely going to connect the same way.

While I think it's worthwhile to consider a product's parent entity and how that might impact product investment, it's important to technically assess these solutions.  What's under the hood may not align with what's marketed.  There has been so much consolidation and acquisition in enterprise software.  These large product portfolios are more like a Byzantine Empire than an aligned ecosystem.","","👍 (1)"

As for SaaS MES, I've been doing it for a while.  The best part is that the more timely product enhancements and that upgrades became a thing of the past.  Also, because it's a service and everyone runs the same version, the vendor and partner/user communities are more engaged.

They're different beasts.  With on-prem MES, you're more likely to see some sort of major disruption (e.g., fragile infrastructure, internal staffing) and slower time to resolution.  With cloud MES, you're more likely to see minor disruptions (e.g., rapid deployment caused a bug, partial performance impact) and faster time to resolution.

Any concerns of cloud pale in comparison to power outages, staffing shortages, asset downtime, process issues, supply chain issues, etc.  Setting aside some data custody issues in regulated industries, I believe most of the concerns over cloud are overstated.  In the end, it's just a different type of distributed architecture.  If one tries to ""lift-and-shift"" what they've been doing for decades, they're going to come up disappointed.

Firms used to put in a private branch exchange and complex telecom circuits at every site just to make phone calls.  They evolved to using shared services and to even cloud.  The key to the success was not ""forklifting"" the incumbent solution forward as architecture evolved.

I know of some customers that use it as a point solution for manual assembly, testing/validation, digital work instructions / guided workflows.  The small customers typically don't have much else.  The bigger customers tend to have larger unwieldy solutions that lacked functionality for specific operational use cases.  It seems like they've pivoted more into a being an MES-like product in recent years.  It reminds me a bit of Tulip, but less customizable and centered on more-specific use cases commonly found in automotive.  Their solutions may have been custom in the past.","",""

But is MQTT also a fit for integration with L4 site logistics systems or application 2 application integration, or poling external public API's?  EG:
 
a)    Transactional L4 inbound/outbound site logistics
MES integration with onsite weighbridges, security boom gates, number plate recognition.  If MQTT is a fit would a broker instance for same site UCS be deployed at L4 and another broker instance at L3 and have them channel MQTT through he IT/OT DMZ firewall, then have MES pub/sub into MQTT L3. broker.  or is this real time communication of L4 site operational events, , to read from NPR and open boom gates and the like while a truck is waiting, not a good fit for MQTT?

b)    3PL SaaS services
MES integration for booking slots, truck number plates, or notification that an incoming truck delivery has passed a geofence and is 5 minutes away and relay that to the site MES system so it can get ready to receive

c)    Enriching MES system with external data sources 
like public API's to collecting temps from weather services, or pricing from energy providers etc
Can this be done with MQTT platforms only, or are iPaaS solutions like boomi/mulesoft better fit for purpose for those external REST/ or business transactional integration?","","💡 (1)"

Short answer is tools like HighByte Intelligence Hub are used for L3/L4 data. This is done with APIs, SQL queries, etc. One of the missing pieces is message handlers (confirming the intended system received the message). There are ways to address it using MQTT, but my opinion is this is more of a work around.

The big question for MQTT is should this functionality be added to the specification or handled by implementations of it. In other words, keep MQTT as is but tools like IH, Cogent DataHub, Ignition modules expand to support L3/L4.

There are also platforms that support the entire enterprise. There are other technologies used along with MQTT for this. Libre Manufacturing is one of them. I have not looked at UMH, but it appears to be similar. Not only does Libre provide a UNS architecture, it includes and API endpoint and data storage.

The next few years will be interesting for sure as the market coalesces around all the new technology.","","💯 (1),👍 (2)"

Put simply, AMQP is sort of a hybrid of pub/sub and client/server.  It's also capable of more than a ""topic-tree"" namespace.  It has worked really well as a service bus in other verticals.  Microsoft (along with its partners), having been an active player behind the standard and using it much throughout Azure, has seemed to be the only advocate for AMQP use in the industrial realm.  While it's much more full-featured and flexible, AMQP lacks the simplicity and efficiency that has drove adoption of MQTT in the market.  I can't help but wonder if AMQP could be (or could have been) a useful tool for these challenges further up the stack.

Regardless, the fact that most solutions in the MES and ERP layers are exposed as HTTP-based web services shouldn't change much.  Even if we're not using request/response workarounds with MQTT, we'll still be using protocol workarounds for the application nodes.  While it's certainly easier to adapt like-paradigm protocols (e.g., request/response to request/response), it's still a massive hassle.  I believe that whatever technology or solutions that best minimize this hassle will win out.

In others words, if one can't convince the application providers to natively adopt the technology, they must make it economical for end-users/integrators to adapt their applications themselves.  It really concerns me when we trivialize this part.","","👍 (2)"

Getting a set of ""building blocks"" that can be used as a quasi-low code approach may look reasonably easy to do, but the customization of business logic is the part that makes every legacy MES product fail. (Along with the lack of a standard back end, it is also what will contribute to Tulip being unable to provide a good solution for Enterprise clients as well.)

@GeoffNunan and his team at Libre are in the process of taking the BPMN-based business logic (read as ""custom MES process"") editor and engine from Prototype to Product right now. It's a drag and drop UI on top of a crazy fast processing engine that interacts with the underlying Headless MES and Knowledge Graph. Once that is complete, Libre will be as close as you can get to a composable platform. The missing bit will be that Libre is UI agnostic and doesn't build MES apps. Fortunately, the UI is the least important part of the MES and since Libre is a single access point GraphQL API, apps are ""easy"" to compose.

Maybe composable for mfg is closer than I thought... 🤣","","👍 (3)"

I'm not such a big fan of the java stack, the external dependencies, the need for a postgres database, or the fact that external services are forced to pull their jobs, rather than being event driven.
So we decided to re-write camunda from scratch in golang as a fully cloud-native, event-driven, distributed, high-availability, scalable solution where we have complete control over the code-base.    
We are able to integrate BPMN processes into the Equipment Model, so that the rules for triggering a BPMN process can be defined on an equipment class. Each equipment that belongs to the class then has that functionality. BPMN processes can also be triggered directly through GraphQL.

An example of what you can do with this might be something like scheduling maintenance when pump efficiencies drop below an acceptable level. On the equipment Class for a pump, you could define properties for the pump speed and flow rate, and you can have a calculated property for efficiency (Gallons/Minute/RPM or something similar). You could also have a static property for the acceptable efficiency.
You can then define a rule that say something like ""If the efficiency of the pump is below target for 10 mins, trigger the BPMN process CreateMaintenanceRequest"". 

We are using NATS for sharing state between BPMN worker nodes and run in Kubernetes, so have access to native load-balancing across services.
As the rest of the platform is GraphQL native ( we forked the Dgraph project earlier this year and have been adding to the functionality of Dgraph to make it do what we want ) it's now easy for us to subscribe to events, define business logic, update the DataHub, call external services and the like.
We are a long way through the development of all of this right now, and will have a release in the first half of 2023.","","👍🏻 (3)"

The why is a bit more nuanced and has two primary parts:

1.  When we started out with Libre,  the thought was that Open Source would be the channel to market that would best serve Manufacturing as a whole while also being a commercially lucrative COSS. We assumed that VCs would be happy to invest because of the incredibly disruptive potential of the platform. That didn't happen. VCs do not see the market as big enough, the problem being new enough and they generally view Libre as just another ERP-type consulting led sale with a multi-year lead time. None of these things are true and so we're happy to bootstrap and use strategic partnerships to do so. Unfortunately, that leads to: 

2. Enterprise customers don't see OSS as a positive and, in reality, probably have much more of a purely negative view. As you well know, developing software (especially with an SDLC to comply with 21 CFR Part 11 / ISO 27001 ) is not cheap. Even if we were a COSS, we would need to drive Enterprise licensing and adjust our roadmap to the wants and needs of those customers in order to underwrite our development costs. It's actually easier to cater to that base if we are not OSS.

The Enterprise view of OSS combined with our choice to bootstrap make the decision to close the codebase a rather straightforward one for us.

However - Not being OSS doesn't mean that Libre is not Open. As a headless backend it's in our best interest to be as open as possible and we do that through our protocols and configuration - MQTT, NATS, GraphQL, etc. and our base schema, which is an open international ISA95 standard. 

Honestly, The Libre Platform as a traditional product, but with an incredible level of openness, is probably much more what the industry needs right now than an accessible codebase.","","👍🏼 (5)"

In the very first iteration of Libre we developed a stack that consisted of a Grafana dashboard and a series of Camunda workflows and UIs. Those sat on top of an InfluxDB instance with a Postgres DB for context. The data stores were populated by NiFi flows from the plant floor. For what we were doing, it functioned fine and produced the intended output, but it was too much work to change the outputs or add to the system and there was NO WAY the customer was going to be able to maintain it.

What this taught us was that, for the most part, Mfg is not ready for a component-based open source solution because there just aren't enough unicorns to do the work. For every @Deleted User or @akos or @RickBullotta, there are thousands of techs and engineers that want exactly what @jpmoniz described in his post above. ""A throat to choke"" when it all goes sideways.

Since the status quo of Rockwell, Siemens and AVEVA was (and is) completely untenable, we opted to use our 150 years of collective experience to write the ""glue"" between the best OSS platforms on the market and that became Libre. Although we quite literally cannot afford to contribute it back to the community because of the cost of dev and maintenance, what we have done is created something that the industry has never seen - Open, headless, infinitely scalable and standardized configuration out of the box with a single access point, federated API and an unlimited use license based on sites.

A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is a software system that connects and manages manufacturing operations in real-time. It provides a holistic view of the production process, from scheduling and resource allocation to material flow and quality control. MES systems play a crucial role in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem by enabling the collection and analysis of data from various sources, such as machines, sensors, and workers, to optimize manufacturing operations and improve overall efficiency.

MES systems typically include modules that manage production scheduling, workflow management, inventory management, labor tracking, and quality management. They also integrate with other systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), to streamline and automate processes further.

One of the key benefits of MES systems is that they provide real-time visibility into the manufacturing process, enabling manufacturers to identify and address issues quickly. They also enable manufacturers to optimize operations by improving efficiency, reducing waste, and increasing productivity.

As for a book recommendation, I would recommend ""Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): Optimal Design, Planning, and Deployment"" by Heiko Meyer. This book covers MES systems comprehensively, including their key concepts, benefits, and implementation strategies. It also includes case studies and best practices from real-world implementations, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to implement an MES system.","",""

 WE connected those to a S7 1200 PLC, and using a bit of logic, had rules so if the first sensor was triggered the machine would be counted as running.
If no sensor was triggered for 2 minutes then the line status was stopped.

We also made a .Net front end and a SQL express backend I think, that  allowed a supervisor to enter in the scheduled operating hours.
And then every time we had a downtime event, the operator was required to enter the reason for the downtime.

It wasn't an ideal solution but the customer got a lot of value from it and for the next line we were able to get data from the Line PLC and do a more proper job.

There was normally a need for the supervisor to adjust the time the machine was scheduled for so it wasn't ideal
In order to restart the Machine, the downtime reason was needed.

MES is more than just a database, or connector, etc...MES orchestrates  all plant level operations. It is the DB that transacts inventory, and uses a barcode to scan in lot codes + the vendor specific machine SW that programs its + the IoT sensor that manages a feedback loop + inspection results (etc. Etc. Etc.).

My biggest misunderstanding was that MES is a database....it also includes all the plant floor applications, services, connectors, visualizations etc.

Also makes sense why you need to build an MES vs. buy...no 2 operations are the same, meaning no 1 ots product could meet any company's unique requirements...

So that is the 3.0 pyramid....in 4.0 does that mean no ""MES"", instead use a machine API, and communicate directly to UNS for all transactions (like a payload reporting results from a machine cycle, or recipe).

Tulip is a no-code (for the most part) platform when has a lower barrier of entry, but also for the same reason has more limitations. There are only so many widgets to choose from. And while it's mostly HTML 5 based, it lacks the adaptability of HTML for mobile vs desktop views. Mobile apps are either separate, or duplicate views within an app.
Both Tulip and Ignition are a ""clean slate"" in a sense. but Tulip includes things like machine monitoring out of the box. It also has Part 11 compliance for business that need it. There are three distinct buckets where data is stored. App completion data (variables and records stored in an immutable database), table data (think a typical SQL database but integrated, and without JOINS), and machine state data. All 3 have separate analytic engines behind them and data does not cross between them.
That being said, you can use apps to push data into each of the three where needed (as long as SOMEONE is running the app).
In many ways Tulip is ""complete"" in that it has the analytics, applications, and data storage all in one platform, whereas in Ignition would would have to procure those separately.
What Tulip doesn't have (YET!) is MQTT. I'm told it's coming. But you can access external SQL and HTTP (REST) data sources.
Ignition is more ""modular"" so you pay for what you use. In that sense you do have more generic access to your data, which I wish I had. But we chose Tulip so the average engineer could create an app to ""scratch his itch"" so it wouldn't have to be done by professionals.
We do however, control specific apps which are more complicated that most where we don't allow just anyone to modify it.","","💯 (4)"

I found the same 3 vendors in my MES / MOM search list not too long ago.

Parsec has some impressive built in capabilities.  Prices may be on the higher end depending on what you want it for, but generally seems to follow the 'you get what you pay for.'  You may be able to save on licensing costs with say Ignition/Sepasoft, but you may have to spend more on custom development yourself/via integrators.  I have only gotten into some basic Sepasoft videos and vendor demos , so can't speak properly to how it stacks up.

We also examined Tulip.  The 99% no-code, 'people on the plant floor can build applications philosophy' really appealed to me (my previous company's home grown MES followed this philosophy to impressive effect), but I couldn't get approval from management to explore that route.  I would love to try out Tulip when I have time and budget for sandboxing.  Democratizing access to build MES modules and applications is a huge cultural shift away from the gatekeeping and siloing of past automation/IT/tech culture.  It's still hard, however, to build systematic, quality, smart tools.  But a few key resources who can teach/guide best practices to a wider group who already understand an operation/facility, can get a lot done.

From what little I know, you'll be in a decent position with any of those 3 platforms, but it all depends on the specifics of your situation.  Are you clear on how these platform's functionality and cost match your scope and requirements?","",""

There are now droves of skilled software engineers, developers, UX designers, etc. across the world.
Eventually a group of them will realize there is value in creating a high quality product, that folks who cannot currently / are not likely to build actual script based programming, but are smart and want to make data flow better (so they can see some information (contextualized data), e.g. how often a certain machine breaks, or how many good parts they made in a shift). This is Tulip's entire business approach. There are enough people in the manufacturing world, probably in Operations, who understand that the Operators and Technicians are the most important people in the organization (P&G's all employees are ""Technicians,"" Gemba walks etc. from Lean Manufacturing), AND who see value in leveraging those folks' knowledge to improve their lines, business units, facilities to ask for it or if they see it, recognize the value.

My guess is this comes from cultural/classist gatekeeping.  If you're poor you don't get to go to college and learn how to program.
Versus, 'We as an organization will succeed, if we can leverage the as much knowledge from the most number of our staff to improve our business.' Imagine you hire a janitor who shows you a time series chart of cleaning consumables data by factory department, that they built, in low/no code.

This was something I missed in my past life because I was unknowingly stumbling my way thru digital transformation. I will never forget how important it is to get buy in at the right times.  I implemented excellent MES solutions with integrations to our ERP, put big screens on the plant floor, showed management: OEE charts, Paretos of live top losses by department, live factory work queues, etc. and they didn't care.

Can someone help me illustrate an example for MES in detail(code would help)

- ERP sends a work order to MES (part#, quantity, etc.)

- MES uses part# from work order to define a route, plan and assign resources. Is there a lot of setup involved prior to this step? (E.g. cycle time, overall build time, station scheduling, timing, routing etc.?). A route should populate a work centers job queue with the expected serial #s or product for process verification

- work order begins, and part is either identified (barcode or other) and approved for route through MES handshake, or  machine independently verifies

- process is recorded into a record in MES indicating what happened (cycle time, product manufactured, quality, etc.)

- MES aggregates this data across all work centers/machines, and at the end if successful closes work order and consumes inventory (backflush)

Adoption of edge computing allows for ""- config/setup of key parameters (e.g. machine properties)"".  Whereas in SQL dynamic schema definition isn't possible.

 MES and have some perspective on what Walker is promoting that is different.  The traditional stack with enough time money and effort can provide the solutions you describe.  One of the most compelling things about the ""Industry 4.0"" approach is cost reduction.  Not only in the spending but in time and resources to implement solutions.  This Industry 4.0 approach leverages that edge devices became capable over the years, while MQTT emerged as a more efficient messaging protocol.  As data science applications become more data-hungry at the enterprise level this approach can provide more granular detail with less configuration effort.

The IoT approach allows for upstream systems like SCADA, MES, SCADA, and data warehousing to leverage object definition at the edge.  This is accomplished with the sparkplug specification.

You can certainly build OEE, and downtime functionality into a Schedule. Or even have a SCADA retrieve the Bill of materials from the ERP

So your mfg.Moduie, is that MES functionality that is  provided by the ERP. 
You could have Plant with a SCADA and ERP that provides all the MES functionality that exists.
I could even argue that Ignition is a SCADA that can develop MES functionality. I would lose that arguement but it's not an realy wild view either.

As for experience, Mentorship and Bootcamps are a good place, IF you can build some proof of concept in your plant using a trial version of ignition that would be the gold standard. Fulfilling an actual need for the company as part of the training. Then you just need to get the company to provide the cost of a licence, and you can start expanding out.  
I would try to doe the prework first though ,i.e. Digital strategy , minimum technical requirements, DTMA,","","👍 (2)"

If you're referring to tenants, most Plex customer run a separate tenant at each site.  Each tenant is an independent configuration with its own GL.  In a multi-site context, they can be ""grouped"" into an enterprise.  There are modules with enterprise functionality (e.g., central treasury, consolidated financials, workflow) and the consistent schema can be queried across tenants.

With multi-tenant SaaS apps running on the same code base, there are certainly limits on what can be customized.  This is nothing new with Enterprise and cloud applications.  But, Plex has pretty extensive configuration.  There are thousands of settings and tons of functionality that can be rapidly put to use.  Most of the functionality was built out by customers paying for specific enhancements to solve real-world problems in their plants.  Does it do everything you want always?  No.  Does it quickly provide functionality that would be hard to build out yourself or possibly find in other platforms?  Depending on the vertical, yes.  Can be it extended or augmented with integrations?  Yes.

All the stored procedures and data sources can be exposed to APIs and the UI builder.  There is a full access to the transaction schema in the reporting database.  Customers can submit their stored procedures for review and get them approved to be deployed in the production environment.  

For most orgs leaving a legacy MES running on AS/400 or something improvised/unsupported/non-existent, it's massive improvement and it can be deployed relatively quickly.  

Customization is not a free lunch, though.  It requires sufficient digital maturity and allocation of resources not just stand it up, but sustain it.  Most who go down the path of customization, fail to lifecycle and they remain stuck on the version it was implemented on.","",""

Overall pricing model is a percentage of revenue.  It varies, but 0.3% of revenue is a good baseline.  Some customers have worked out per seat or per employee deals as an alternative model.

[2]
Not sure what typical is, but it does vary greatly.  Revenue-based pricing and breadth-and-depth of modules complicates this.  I'm aware of some implementations with very experienced end users that have been as little as 40 hours professional services.  Many customers can self-implement after they've been gone through the process of standing up for the first site or two.  If it helps, I've heard overall revenue from software is ~70% and services is ~30%.  This doesn't include implementation partners.

[3]
While it can be deployed as a point solution, it's not that common.  At this point, it's likely more of a commercial (i.e., bundling, deal size) limitation than a technical one.  In general, there's a lot of value leveraging the functionality from other modules because it integrates well.  The marginal cost of standing up more functionality is relatively low.  I've heard of some standalone quality customers.  The more common scenario is two-tier ERP scenarios where a traditional ERP may be ran at HQ for corporate workloads (e.g., financial consolidation, corporate performance mgmt, HCM) and Plex deployed at a site as a manufacturing ERP/MES.  The A/P, A/R, and costing are tightly integrated into the production, inventory, shipping, and supply chain modules.  Large enterprises will often as expose this as a sub ledger to their corporate ERP as a sub-ledger.

[4]
Unfortunately, not much is event driven.  There is a legacy ""outbound"" SOAP client, but it's largely been deprecated.  Most the APIs are data sources / SPROCs wrapped as SOAP/XML or HTTP/JSON.  It requires polling from a SCADA or middleware to detect changes and derive events.  For many years, the integration strategy was ""let's expose this SPROC"" or whatever the customer paid them to do.","",""

A traditional MES will have a master data model with specific modules related to executing a manufacturing plan.  Sometimes it's a part of a manufacturing ERP suite.  Other times, it's a standalone application with some capability to run on its own or integrate with ERP for planning.  The plan might consist of a work order, kanban, batch, etc.  The plan can be associated with workcenters or assets that will ""consume"" resources (e.g., labor, material, asset hours) to run production.  It will have specific capabilities to enforce the production process and track the progress.  For example, state events (e.g., setup, run, down) that impact availability or utilization are logged.  Additionally, production records are logged (source inventory, processed inventory, rejections/defects).  It can go much further than this.  Off-the-shelf MES solutions will typically cater to specific modes of manufacturing and verticals.  While they're configurable and can be customizable to varying degrees, they're prescriptive in how they're used.  On some level, one has to ""accept"" the MES as a business process.  This is where the buy vs build topic comes up.  There exist tradeoffs, but this is a separate topic.","",""

I don’t see MES and Tulip/Mendix as an either/or problem.  If the goal is to have a 50k square meter facility run and report production that adhere to a master data model, an MES is the solution.  If the goal is to create specific interfaces or apps to make processes more efficient, Tulip/Mendix is a good option.  They’re actually great options if one desires non-technologists play a role in build and maintaining it.   If the goal is both, use both.
 
Whether bought or built, some of the rigidity of a proper MES can be useful.  It helps enforce a business process that should be highly repeatable and uniform.  For example, if the results of MES are used to determine planning, one probably wants very consistent underlying records and little-to-no flexibility.  If one wants to reduce takt time on two dissimilar assembly processes, one may desire flexibility to optimize training, work instructions, and the overall interface to do so.","","💯 (6),👍 (2)"

It has surprised me that the major cloud vendors who want manufacturing data flowing their platforms have not explored this.  For example, imagine some sort of service to define a schedule, log production events, and report them.  Instead, there's always this emphasis on asset monitoring or digital twins.  When there is an OEE reference architecture, it typically involves infrastructure or platform services that virtually no one in operations would play a role in maintaining.

Just seeing if this resonates with anyone and if there are any online examples that may help me explain this concept to others and/or approach it in a better way?","","👍🏼 (1)"

I don't remember the formula we used for ESH but it was exactly as you described it. I basically took a formula from our Continuous Improvement team to the guys at Sepasoft and they made it happen. I think the main gist of it was instead of adding 1 to the part counter every 15-30 minutes (literally 1, since we were low volume) we were doing a calculation based on the standard cycle time and then adding that to a cumulative ESH count.

Also, I think you can still purchase the bootcamp recording. Since I had already gone through this project with  Sepasoft it was pretty easy to follow the bootcamp.","","👍 (1)"

From a complexity standpoint just monitoring if your spindle is turning gets about 80-90% of the value without needing to do all these rate calculations.

The pallet changer aspect has definitely complicated our MES implementation as well.  You can  have 2 different part numbers running at a single time on one machine each will have its own rate associated with it.","","💯 (1)"

1. For clarity, the scope of MES within this thread is actually Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM). MOM covers all of Layer 3 of ISA95 (Production/Inventory/Quality/Maintenance Operations Management). Even though MES is a subset of MOM, we use the term MES as though it were MOM as term MES resonates with stakeholders better than MOM.
2. Off-the-shelf MES solutions typically can't cater for the diversity of MES requirements across different organisations. It's becoming apparent that we need a composable MES that consists of modules for each of the various capabilities. These modules might be supplied by different vendors and some might be written in-house.
3. A UNS is not a substitute for an MES. UNS is useful for real-time context of data; the MES might publish it's data to the UNS, and also subscribe to other data in the UNS, but the UNS does not contain the capabilities of Manufacturing Operations Management.
4. Solutions with Ignition seem to be favoured over traditional vendor solutions e.g. Rockwell, Aveva. Traditional vendors can often be 10x the price of Industrial Automation offerings. Sepasoft seems to be a 'native' MES solution for an Ignition Solution.","",""

Furthermore, does it make sense when you establish 3rd party SW that cover some parts of an MES?","",""
"1073632885153730621","vaughnturner","2023-11-29T00:24:37.1520000+08:00","Here's some things to consider. 

Understanding the Current State vs. Future State: If the IT/OT infrastructure is going to change drastically, it's crucial to assess how these changes will impact the MES. The assessment should not only consider the current environment but also anticipate future modifications. Also how do the changes align with you digital strategy? If you don't have one, you could be setting yourself up for extreme technical debt.

Flexibility and Scalability: A key principle in MES implementation is ensuring the system is flexible and scalable. Even if the IT/OT infrastructure is changing, the MES should be adaptable to these changes. The assessment will evaluate how well the MES can integrate with both the current and upcoming IT/OT environment.

Integration of Third-Party Software: The inclusion of third-party software in an MES environment is fairly common. The assessment would answer how these software components will interact with the MES, through establishing your Minimum Technical Requirements. A thorough evaluation of the compatibility, data exchange capabilities, and potential bottlenecks or redundancies that these integrations might introduce is needed to mitigate unintended issues. 

Risk Management and Contingency Planning: Also want to think about incorporating risk management and contingency planning into your overall strategy. Identifying potential risks associated with infrastructure changes and developing strategies to mitigate these risks.

Phased Approach: In a situation where significant changes are expected, a phased approach to implementation might be advisable, if at all possible. You want to allow for adjustments and refinements as the infrastructure evolves.

Obviously we suggest starting with a digital strategy, why do you want to be digital. If you can't answer that question, we always advise against purchasing anything. Moreover, through the  assessment process you will reveal your current state, desired future state, minimum technical requirements, suggested architecture, and then the iterations of the transformation journey. Basically, undertaking a transformation journey, whether an enterprise wide initiative, or just replacing one component without an assessment is like getting in your car for a cross country trip without checking your tires, fluids, etc, and not bringing up your GPS for directions. You're travelling blind.","","👍 (3)"

From my experience the products out there have either ridiculously expensive license models, or are tied to frameworks for which you need additional licenses and depend on multiple companies, are hard to interface with, use outdated technology, or all of the above.

I've seen (and participated in, at a previous employer) building from scratch too, which is a pain to maintain, dependant on the team (internal or integrator) and because of that a risk. It also costs time reinventing the wheel and often while things will work they're far from optimized since it's done by generalists like myself instead of having the DB schema designed by an expert DBA and so on.

With an open source initiative I mean (ideally multiple) people/companies building/maintaining a solid basis on which they and others can build and add features without paying ever increasing license costs. Start with a solid DB schema and some standard functionality, built with popular and free technology, for example start with a postgres DB and a .NET application exposing a REST API.

I really liked what I initially saw from Libre and starting from ISA95, even better if owned/maintained by not just 1 company.","","👍 (2)"

Our go-to for many years (note I am not an SAP person rather a manufacturing integration guy) was to leverage MII and use IDOC transfer via an RFC destination configuration and direct RFC / BAPI calls via the JCo / JRA connections available in Netweaver (all straight forward in MII, thanks @RickBullotta  👍 ), though will eventually be phased out for DM / DMC which will leverage BTP / CPI / PCo et al. Rest API's may be available, plus PI/PO is likely around in places, and the dreaded flat file 🤨  I'm sure is still hanging around and used somewhere. I've seen many products say that they ""integrate with SAP"" but really they leverage an interposing SQL database or similar (which of course may work fine for certain use cases). I guess it depends on what type of integration you need, how often, how big, who owns it, how is it triggered, how is it monitored, what quality of service is important, how ""bi-directional"" it actually needs to be, etc. Need to consider the use case .... is it for flowing production & process orders to the shop floor / goods movements / production receipts / master data sync & transfer / quality plan & results integration / batch integration / etc. Lots of considerations!","","👍🏼 (2)"

- SAP team wanted to do the least work possible on their side, so we were forced to initiate all transactions from the MES side. Let's say that it didn't go well since we had to get lots of data from SAP (WO, operations, instructions,...). SAP has to push data at some point.
- We used APIs for the communication MES -> SAP. If you were to use this, keep an eye on data size, it can seriously impact performance.
- We used IDOC for SAP -> MES communication afterward, and it was a decent way to get lots of data.

But in reality, all those micro-stops or speed losses are adding up and you’re nowhere near running at the technical capability of the process. Assuming you set the standard correctly, providing a transparent view on the simple OEE%(even if the quality element is back calculated) will likely lead to better performance if managed correctly. Even just a rolling X hours(depends on nature of process) at a 15 min refresh rate or something around those lines - nothing crazy. If you have multiple processes in series with no inventory buffer in between, the time series trends of that rolling OEE will also tell you where the live bottleneck is, which may shift and go unnoticed.

For example, let’s say there is a requirement to have a batch start and end time captured in the MES, which originates in PCS7. Ideally this will be event driven and automatically be pushed to the MES system. Using the PI Web API the data can be pulled into the MES, but not pushed I think - probably the same if native MES-PI connectivity is possible. Not having done this before I assume a direct integration between PCS7 and the MES system will be possible, but more complicated and may “strain” the PCS. Going the other direction, let’s say you are making a certain product with recipe in the MES system and would like to automatically push the recipe to the PCS to eliminate the potential for selecting the incorrect recipe. I am fairly sure the PI Web API will not make sense here, but could be wrong. I think HighByte, HiveMQ or something similar will be ideal here for both examples - @MikeBartlett do you agree?

Otherwise, yes, if the MES can query a REST Endpoint, that query is possible.  I wouldn't query the PCS7 unless it persists data somehow.  Going the other way, if the PCS7 has a Batch Execution System, I would think that recipe push capability would be native or conform to some sort of standard.  If you are building the recipe out of logic, it would be odd to use the PI Web API unless you are storing those recipe parameters in PI.  You might be able to push OPC via an output from MES to PI tags or use a PI connector to query a REST endpoint on the MES if that exists.

There are 3 use-cases that we see in Bio Pharma:
1 - Real-time batch record. The Rhize platform sits between the DCS and the MES and orchestrates workflows between the two, capturing all the data as it goes. We can then do some really smart things with deviation management, and can generate a real-time batch record.
2 - Brown-field MES. There are a lot of factories that have DCS / PLC systems that were implemented long ago, and adding a new MES on top of them in the traditional ""Top-down"" command and control approach is not feasible. In the Rhize platform, you configure your processes and the platform listens to the equipment status, keeping track of batch execution and phases even if the PLC does not. This is the basis of a ""Bottom-up MES approach for Bio Pharma that can be implemented without a wholesale re-implementation of the control system.
3 - Predictive batch analysis: In Bio Pharma, batch harvest times can vary greatly from batch to batch, and knowing when to harvest can have a big impact on overall throughput. By using the ""Bottom-Up"" approach, we can get contextualised, real-time data that can be used to predict batch harvest times. At one customer's site, we are able to predict the optimal harvest time 24 hrs prior to harvest with an accuracy of +- 5 minutes.","","👍🏻 (2)"

I find that MES (and batch control) systems are way more efficient in doing recipe management and coordination control, especially across multiple PLC's.
Easier to build, easier to maintain, easier to update and validate. Of course if there's real time interfacing needed between units you'll need to do that on a lower level.

Yes you can build all this in the PLC's as well, but this might be a big effort up front and a pain later on.
Often people indeed start with the question ""but what if MES is down?"" and conclude they have to make sure they can run without it and build everything in the PLC.
But then you have to consider the additional costs (now and down the line) and/or limitations in the future, and ask yourself the question how long can you really run without SCADA/MES, usually recipe management is not the only function here.

In my opinion it's almost always better to spend your efforts on making SCADA/MES more robust rather than adding extra complexity on the PLC level.","","👍 (1)"

Just had another look and went through the docs, and I have to say this is very exciting and at the same time a bit daunting.
I haven't used or even properly looked into Kubernetes myself, has been on my list forever.
There's not much I don't love about what I read in the docs (Pure ISA95, Graph DB, timeseries DB, GraphQL, MQTT and OPCUA, BPMN, ...).
+ how open you are about what's used underneath the hood (Dgraph, infuxdb, NATS, ...)

I myself have worked with AVEVA MES in the past, some custom .net based solutions, and recently on big pharma implementations with Siemens Opcenter EX PH 🤮 

At this moment I'm focusing mostly on small manufacturing companies selling projects to build out my own SI company offering anything between field and ERP connection.
Looking into Sepasoft modules for the MES/batch part here at the moment. I like the transparancy, ease of use, ISA95 object models and affordability.
I am aware of scalability concerns.

I'm definitely very interested in Rhize, so a couple questions:
- Can I try it?
--- What would be the best way to learn more in detail, any recommendation how I can go about that?
- What is the licensing model and cost
--- Is there an affordable solution for small companies
--- How does it scale for big sites and enterprises
- Do you have any customers in the EU (ideally Benelux or close to BE) that might be interested in some extra manpower (freelance / t&m), I'd like to get hands on in a project setting

I see a couple of Youtube videos were recently posted as well, haven't watched yet but will soon.

- kubernetes is not for the faint of heart, it's a very powerful but complex platform that takes some time to master.
- under the hood is a react UI for configuring ISA95 entities, a bunch of golang microservices, NATS as the MQTT Broker and message queue platform and our graphql native, graph based, ACID compliant database which started as a fork of dgraph 2 years ago, and to which we've added and refactored quite a bit. The database is now our own code. We are also embedding AppSmith as the UI development platform for low-code user interfaces.

We are not yet suitable for small manufacturing companies due to the complexity of kubernetes. At some point in the future we will offer a cloud-hosted version of the platform so that small manufacturing companies don't have to worry about the infrastructure.

"1073312001788477471","sparkylarks","2024-03-05T05:53:51.7500000+08:00","I had a user case a few years ago where we were scanning a Barcode, comparing the String to the Item No from the ERP, if it did not match the line would stop, but we wanted to capture all the results of the test. Similarly we would check weight the item and record the weight the pass fail and the label barcode.

And Quality insisted that we would not lose any records , 
and Operations insisted that could not stop the line because of IT issues. 
Our Stack was AB PLC -> WW IO -> System Platform -> WWMES->MII ->SAP.

So the results would be buffered in a 100 long array.
If the position 0 had data in the buffer, a Data Available Tag would be set to 1 by the PLC. 
That would trigger a script in System Platform that would Insert the Data in the MES DB Table.
if the script ran without an error, then System Platform would reset the Data Available Tag to 0.
In the PLC if the Data Available Tag was 0, the Buffer would position shift and if the position 0 had data in the buffer ..... 

If the Buffer overflowed, then the line would stop. 
It never did but it did get to the 80's, until the scripting was refined 

We updated it so instead of setting a Data Available Bit, we gave each quality check a unique ID, QCID and then instead of  resetting the bit we passed the Sam transaction number back down to a ""Last Stored Transaction"" Tag, and if that matched the same QCID in Position 0 then the buffer shifted.

I'd probably approach it differently today and pass the data in Position 0 to a MQTT Broker, and have my MES subscribe to the buffer and parse out the transactions and store in a DB, and then publish back the last Transaction ID and allow the PLC to subscribe to that. Not sure if you could pass all the items in the buffer as a single JSON, and do a multi read, assuming you could pass back multiple Transaction ID' s it could work","",""

I like the idea of MQTT with business systems which are cloud based or vulnerable due to the fact that a shop floor client must subscribe to receive data transmission. I assume this makes it more difficult for bad actors to abuse a device via a DMZ exposed MQTT broker.

The Insert mechanism took a few seconds.
Depending on the line in the plant some were filling at 2 per minute, some 8 per minute, and some were 30 pails a minute.

Our first machine to go live was the 8 per minute, and the buffer was filling,
 
We changed the Polling frequency for the buffer related tags, down from 1 Second to maybe 200ms. But the main culprit was the insert scripts.
I didn't recode the scripts, but I think that initially there were two scripts one being called by the other, and that was where most of the problem was.
after the change the script processed in a few hundred milliseconds, I think , but certainly the buffers on the 8 pail per minute machines never filled, and the buffers on the high speed machine might get as high as 20 over a few hours, but a break time or downtime would allow the buffer to be cleared.

In I3.0 world I wouldn't worry that someone might change the IO driver settings, and certainly I have seen people polling the wrong tag , or register in Modbus.

If I was implementing it to day ,on a machine that doesn't have SpB natively
 I would have node red running on an edge device in the Machine and do the buffering in that. 
If you run a edge broker locally you can have node red, read the data from the PLC, and publish to the Broker. QoS=1 and Retain.
And enable store forward 
A client with QoS=1 will then get all the messages.
or you can use a timescale DB
The issue with buffers in the PLC is they can take up a lot of memory, a lot of the machines we had were running AB 17XX-L85 but we had 8 to 10 Quality checks, and wanted a buffer size of 100.

I guess I already had a pretty streamlined process with the tag polling method I was comfortable with. All our tag configurations were stored in a SQL DB with a station assignment/mapping reference.  So I just created a query which returned all the tags in the PLC handshake in XML format against their station assignment. Then I would just add one header line to the XML file and load the XML file in the OPC client, which would allow me to poll/view the tags on my PC. 
With this I could see each station handshake in realtime with a timestamp. If data changes occurred but the SQL database did not update or the manufacturing system front end did not reflect, I knew there was some errors in the logic. And vice versa if I was expecting a PLC action.
I really liked this because the manufacturing system was configurable and I could easily replicate viewing the data on my client within a minute.
In Addition, I could easily browse the device namespace if I had any doubts or needed to pull some tag names. 

My hesitation with MQTT has been the lack of browse ability, configuration, and troubleshooting. But now that you describe it, I think I could just subscribe to all topics on my PC client manually through a custom script, like python or something, using the MQTT handshake configuration data. And, as you mentioned, if QoS=1 then should receive all messages, including the last stored value upon MQTT client  initialization. Essentially recreating OPC client. I like it. 

With QoS and store and forward, I wonder if PLC buffering would ever even be needed anymore? 
Won't the broker handle that instead?","",""

- for unexpected downtime events,  while l I am told it is seconds, I found it was normally in minutes( 2 to 5 I would say), and that could be over 1000 quality records

I favour, High Availability (HA) setup with active-passive redundancy. you have two applications running on separate servers, and both the primary and secondary are monitoring, each other and you get a failover that truly only takes seconds.

But, I think in these scenarios we should hold IT accountable. Any mission critical on premise service should be properly monitored, by a services like solarwinds/splunk/grafana for instance, during all operational hours. This should have proper alerting thresholds configured, at the bare minimum, alerting if a service goes down. And, ideally the OT poc should also be alerted if this service goes down, but that may go into an ownership debate lol. In addition, a great IT will have strict change management (while a pain) and good RCA investigations, with the option to submit emergency change request when needed. A VM should not take weeks/months to provision, firewall changes should not take weeks/months to be applied, IT changes should not be unplanned/uncommunicated, changes should happen according to business downtime windows, and security patches should be as up to date as possible. 

I've seen a good scenario where OT owns the applications and shop floor OT hardware (non-networking), but IT owns the infrastructure and enterprise hardware. Of course there was fighting, especially because of the technical language barrier between the 2 teams, but I believe it is possible. 
In my opinion, OT will miss out on far too many great IT inventions like HA clusters and now even container orchestration if OT keeps pushing IT out.

I always suggest , that you start with an open Platform you can build a MES, and other solutions on and Integrate into .

Building from Scratch is very hard, if you a really starting from scratch. 
Project 1 is create software, Project 3 is solve problems.
Configuring a platform, and augmenting that with some custom build, lets you start solving problem at the start.

Of course you can build what I would call a ""Proto-MES"" using the MING stack or similar to give you access to Data and some Dashboards, and even some MES functionality but you may struggle as you scale. and that is sort of a Platform too , or a collection of them

Below is one of the first 4.0 solutions video's I watched, and I think the debate really became, is to 60% build and 40$ buy or 40% buy and 60% build

The value is in the ability for a wider audience, outside of just industrial control systems engineers, to play a roll in building apps.

The vast majority of Ignition projects I’ve seen are classic HMI projects to read and write tag data from machines. Most Tulip projects I’ve seen are focused on guiding an operator through a process with interactive work instructions, enforcing quality procedures, with audit-grade logging, executing complex manufacturing transactions, etc. This is not say that there are not exceptions to this, but rather there is probably a good reason for these observations. There is a difference in the focus and problems the users are solving.

These discussions would better be oriented around “what capabilities do I need to support specific types of use cases with the right time to value” rather than “how many HMI clients can I get for the lowest cost?”.  Understanding what scales well is function of what are the things operators need to interface with. Do they just need to monitor and interact with machines? Or are there more comprehensive business processes that span beyond the machine? Who will build and maintain these screens?","","👍 (3),💡 (2)"

In many cases, ""slightly-stale-but-high-quality"" MES data can be better than ""fresh"" MES data.  For example, I'd rather wait for a record of four hours of idle time to be reviewed and properly reclassified than accept rolling KPIs that are volatile and don't reflect reality.  Because the real-time consumption can differ from the historical consumption, CDC may not necessarily be beneficial or worth the effort.

Quite a few HighBye users are using CDC for replicating their disparate site-level MES.  Another approach users take is indexed reads.  This works well if the changes are only new records.  The queries will be setup to pull a batch of records against an index.  The index will be maintained and updated only when data successfully reaches its destination.  Both CDC and indexed-backfills work well.

The upside to CDC is that it can efficiently pick up modified records.  It's very common in MES to make adjustments to logs (e.g., misclassified downtime event, adding notes, lagging quality events).  The downside is sometimes, if abused, CDC can be problematic in terms of system resources.  Depending on what other workloads the database is running, this may or may not be a problem.  There are other replication techniques beyond CDC.  It's probably best to choose one based on the consumption patterns and use cases for the data.  For example, some KPIs in an org's business intelligence layer may not necessarily benefit from continuously running aggregate calculations on MES transactions second-by-second.  There might be slower, but more graceful and efficient alternatives.  It's also worth mentioning that if it's database-to-database, the native replications features (e.g., MS SQL snapshots, secondary replicas) are tried-and-true options.","","👍 (1)"

Introduction: Addressing Key Challenges with Flexible Solutions

[Customer Name] is facing a range of challenges in [key areas: machine monitoring, operational processes, workflow digitization, etc.]. Our proposal introduces a flexible solution tailored to your specific needs, integrating three key technology platforms: [Platform A], [Platform B], and [Platform C]. These platforms address various pain points such as machine data collection, workflow digitization, real-time visualization, and production planning/scheduling.

Questionnaire: Understanding [Customer Name]’s Key Pain Points

Provide a list of targeted questions to understand the customer's needs:

1. Machine Monitoring

Do you need real-time machine data collection from sources like PLCs or sensors?

Is real-time monitoring of machine performance and downtime critical to your production goals?

Do you need a system to store and analyze machine parameters for long-term insights?

2. Operational Processes

Are manual processes (like paper-based logs or quality checks) causing delays or errors?

Do you require digital work instructions and standardized workflows?

Would you benefit from tools for production planning and scheduling?

3. Visualization and Reporting

Is real-time visibility into production performance important for your team?

Do you prefer an on-premise or cloud-based solution for data visualization and reporting?

4. Budget and Licensing Preferences

Do you prefer a one-time licensing fee or are you open to subscription models?

How important is minimizing costs when selecting a solution?","","👍 (1)"

One of our customers is into a big digital transformation: UNS + new MES (my company) + new ERP + new LIMS.
One issue we are constantly facing in the MES implementation is that we are customizing the standard interfaces to accommodate to the legacy L2 capabilities and the new ERP constraints. This is being done modifying the MES standard code, and while it’s a common practice when we implement projects, I’m not sure if it’s the best practice when having a UNS.
Right now we have the following workflow: L2 sends the production report of one of the lines, MES process it, modifying some data and applying some production logic to it, and sends it immediately to the ERP (there is no manual data added into the MES).
Based on that, is it ok to do that “interface mapping” in the MES or would it be better that the UNS broker does it? On one side, with the current implementation we break the principle of reducing intermediate interfaces, but it’s also a bad practice that the broker does some production logic…","",""

If you were to publish the production report to the UNS, you would still need to modify or add more information to it for your ERP to consume from it. May look something like L2 -> UNS -> MES -> UNS -> ERP.

Now we have that workflow L2 -> UNS -> MES -> UNS -> ERP, but the UNS is not doing any processing on the intermediate data, that’s being done in the MES.
My question is if it might be better to have 3 workflows: L2 -> UNS, UNS -> MES and UNS -> ERP, and in this case the UNS broker would process the data to what the MES and ERP require.","",""

It routes it from publishing nodes to subscribing nodes.

So I think your first work flow is good. But if the ERP or LIMS or CMMS need data from L2 that data should not have to go through the MES.

In this case, the ERP needs the line reports from L2, but it can't directly use the raw data that L2 sends (the same applies to the MES). Since the MES offers more flexibility in its interface mapping, we are processing the data the MES needs there, and we also process it according to the ERP's requirements before sending it (MES -> UNS -> ERP). This way, at least the UNS doesn't process any data.

As @Brian Pribe mentioned, the issue originates from L2, but it's a legacy system, and replacing it is out of scope for now.

Unfortunately, the project is already being implemented, and there is an NDA in place, so I can't disclose the products being used. That said, do you think something like HighByte or Litmus could help in this situation?","",""

Transformation should be the role of the Hub. On any reasonably large system, it's not feasible to enforce standardisation across all publishers, so the role of the Hub is to keep a standardised format, which requires transformation.
In large systems, Transformation can also require MasterData management. Example: Equipment A is called Equipment B in some other system. Master Data management is also a role of the Hub.
In large systems these functions need to be manageable at scale, which means templates with hierarchical inheritance / composition. It can also mean table and row based access controls to facilitate governed, group-wide templates and site-based extensions to those templates.
I say `In large systems` because of course all of this can be easily managed with some scripts in ignition on a small system.","","👍 (1)"

3. Reduce the Hun's load. Doing the job of a broker and dataops put a strain on the resources (CPU, ram, etc) Best to decouple the broker and the dataop part too or you are one bad code away from screwing up the entire platform (We are not talking from experience, promise 😅)

Implementation times are typically faster too. We recently built a fully featured MES for a 5-factory roll-out in 4 months. 100% fit to requirements.

Most control engineers are great at designing a UX that solves the needs of the machine operator because they are close to the problem, and can empathise with the person who is using the software they design.

Innovation is application design is largely a factor of how fast the designer can go through the cycle of build, deploy, learn, build, deploy, learn.
The problem is that scaling that innovation out to 200 controls engineers across 40 factories like one of our customers did with Tulip creates a problem of governance. How do you balance innovation with standardisation? How do you balance creativity with comparable, analysis ready data?

Bt to me the role of the Integrator and certainly the system Architect is to understand the customer needs and recommend the correct product.
and top find out where n the line between uncustomisable but fast to get moving( i.e. low hours) or completely customisable but needs a lot of hours. that @RickBullotta alludes to .

But if a company takes a major platform for the MES( and we are in the MES channel) so Ignition, Aveva MES, even System Platform, WinCC, Op Center. They are likely to be ok on the software side.

But  the issue is that as we build out our Industry 4.0 infrastructure, the MES platform often is being asked to do more but it isalready the intesection between the IT and OT Apps. And if we are in Brownfield situation in particular, it can be difficult to recommend a sperate IIoT platform, or Data Ops software, or both, when the MES or even SCADA software can do a good job.

Do I really recommend ripping out Aveva System Platform with a custom MES that is doing all the SCADA and MES functionality well , and rebuilding it with Ignition, RHIZE, Flow, Highbyte or Litmus, or some combination of the lot

There are many factors in the decision on which MES to implement, and a good SI will work to find the best fit for the customer.
There are many Off-the-shelf options that are a better fit for specific use-cases than a headless option too.

I did a lot of custom code with Geoff at Nukon and I found myself rebuilding the same thing over and over. I also spent a ton of my career on a super opinionated tool called SAP and had to become a wizard to customise the tool in order to fulfil the customer requirement, it was super hard, painful and hacky.

If you go too far on the abstraction, creating a product with all the tables and screens you think the customer will need, yes, you may create an environment that is lacking and will require customisation and that will be painful and will probably block upgrades.

If you stay too low on the framework every project is engineering, needing coders, and they will cost $$.

My goal in TilliT is to try to nail that sweet spot where you have building blocks like Lego and you are trying to fulfil the customer requirement (not letting her down), whilst moving fast and safe. So part of the model is defined, things like machines, materials, orders, you dont have to build those. But we have a powerful workflow engine built for manufacturing (Not BPMN - lessons learned there), that allows the customer to compose a solution. And yes, you can add in some code for behaviour and custom UI components.

I think our customers are getting satisfied and their requirements solved. But our customers are limited to a range of industries. So not all customers fit this model. But the ones that do, get a real good experience. If you are trying to do lights out, no operator, than I'd suggest skipping TilliT. If you are just doing Connected Worker, QMS, LMS, Track and Trace, well, I think we have a very interesting tool.","","👍 (1),👌 (1),💯 (2)"

-Are you using appropriate storage/disk service tier for hosting a database? Databases need IOPS to avoid slowing down everything. Avoid storage tiers designed for backups or hosting images for CDNs to cache.

When you think about SQL, there are a lot of problems:
- it's difficult to horizontally scale. SQL databases are mostly designed to be scale-up rather than scale-out. Of course there are exceptions, but those exceptions add complexity, and require additional skills to operate.
- you need a Database administrator to keep it running and performing well.
- Most graduates out of university don't get taught SQL any more, so you start from a clean sheet teaching you team about the difference betwenn left joins and right joins.
- you need a whole other application ORM layer in your application.
- row-level security is painful.

SQL server, and most SQL systems sacrifice speed for consistency, meaning 2 queries from different clients at the same time will always get the same result.
'Big data' NoSQL databases sacrifice consistency for speed by using eventual-consistency, meaning eventually, some time after a transaction occurs, all clients will see the same results.
That's often good enough for analytical databases, and never good enough for transactional source systems.
The biggest problem with distributed, horizontally scalable system has been that there are very few databases which are distributed and consistent, but the benefits of that architecture to an MES are huge.

If you think the complexity only lies in the tags, I/O, etc, wait until you map all the process flow (people, machine, material) that happens inside the four walls of a factory.

but allow for things to get moved.
Lets define a few terms first
a Work Order, is an order from the ERP, it has 1 SKU/Product code going to 1 customer
a Production order is an order that runs on a machine, it might have a number of work orders but is same finished product.

Normally when you create the production Orders the Scheduling software, or the person with the excel sheet, will need to allow for CIPs to be run before a production runs typically.
there may also be rules like a CIP must take place x hours before a Production Order, or a CIP is needed every 24 hours
Depending on the Previous product the CIP required may also change, so Product A to B might need no CIP, Product A to C might need a rinse only , Product   B to C might need a full CIP and Product D always needs Kosher CIP.  

But those CIP's are Production Orders that are assigned to the Machine. you genrally need a rules engine of some sort to decide the CIP type needed. If you are very simple, and every product always need the same CIP, I would recommend that when you create the Production order the required CIP order is created, and you have two tables a CIP Order table and Production order table, the CIP order is linked to a Production order entry. 

So the operator looking at their screen should see the Production and CIP orders in a single table, but you also need to validate the CIP before you run it. Maybe you are boing from A to B but there is a rule that a full CIP is required every 24 hours and it has been 26 hours since the last one. 

and you need logic that will not allow a new Production order to start unless the correct CIP has been performed, according to the rules. this is more important if operators or supervisors  can change the schedule, i.e. we were planning to product B after A so a rinse was scheduled, but some materials are missing so we want to do Product C so we need to validate that a full CIP was performed","",""

Same goes for COP or any cleaning procedures. I'm curious to hear some other opinions, since your phrasing makes it sound to me like it's the absolute truth and I'm not convinced it is. 

My opinion / experience:

- A CIP order is definitely a work order, regardless of its origin. Work is done. Same goes for maintenance orders from the CMMS for example.
- A CIP order is not a production order, no product is being manufactured in a CIP order.
- A CIP order is not inherently linked to a production order, it can be if it makes sense for your process, but often it doesn't.
- CIP orders are generally created on the MES level (we agree here I think). Using a rule-based engine as a detailed scheduler (or at least scheduling assistant) for both CIP and production orders (you want to optimize both) is a great idea.
- A CIP should update equipment properties (sanitary status, expiry time, ...) which are validated against equipment requirements of a production order.

Whether you have your CIP orders in the same table as the production orders is a design choice, and I'm not sure what I like more there. From my experience though, I usually see them in one and the same wo table in a relational DB.","","👍 (1)"

I think we agree what a CIP order is too, I was using terminology form the plant where I did most of my CIP work.
and in that case they said, because it occurs on the production floor it is a production order 🤷‍♂️ 

but using what I think using your terminology( which is better I admit)
 Work Order is any allocation of time on a machine
There are different types of Work Order that can be assigned to a machine
 - Production Order where Stuff is made
 - CIP order, where cleaning occurs
 - Maintenance Order where the equipment is maintained.

and in that case, I agree with everything above,
the only difference was the linking of the CIP to the production order. and I have had systems where the CIP requirements were purely time based so that did not apply.
but when creating a schedule, where the CIP required depends on the previous and next Production orders, having that link allowed the initial schedule to be created.
It did often get deleted when things on the production floor were changed, so maybe there was a butter approach but it was helpful in creating that initial schedule, and in understanding why a particular CIP was chosen. but it was possible to schedule a CIP not linked to a Production Order, i.e. first ting on Monday morning

if you only have one CIP recipe , it might well be overkill, but in this case there was a massive Matrix of potential SKU's to process. 
 WE probably could have done without it , 

the reason we had two tables was because , apart form the scheduled time the particulars of the CIP order and production order are not the same","","👍 (1)"

I'm not generally a proponent of wide tables, which would happen if you had ""one table to rule them all"" for all order types.

To me Management Execution Folks(the MEF) needs software tools to help them.

Talking about an MES to me implies that the solution needs to be a Software, and ideally one with MES in the name.

But if you look a series of Functional Needs that the MEF have, then perhaps those functions can exist on different software.

and Regardless of whether you say you are going to build or Buy, you end up with a bunch of configuration anyway. I think the Walker and Sean Robinson Build V;s Buy debate, really came down to (60% build, 40% Buy) V's (40% Build, 60% Buy). And whether you end up with the Software Vendors Customising or a System Integrator Building it is still essentially people creating DB tables and writing scripts.

That said, I like the openness of an Architecture led approach, where you can have a highly customisable IIoT Platform. And any decent system Integrator will have a MES template( in fact more than one) based on previous systems they built, to start with that can be customised for you. It's not like they will be starting from Scratch. And certainly froma corporate point of view, because no manufacturing plant is the same as another no single software will suit. What a lazy  CTO expects from a COTS is just not possible at all .

and there are a lot of profitable Integrators that build MES solutions on Platforms that don't; have ongoing licencing costs, for a lot less than what a software vendors customises their solution for. There are quite a few of us on this platform too. 

Integrating into SAP is not a problem either, and some of their modules lie SAP PM are pretty decent, but they don;t have a proven MES solution IMHO. The sam as they do not have a SCADA or PLC solutions. Lots of MES and IOT platforms though will integrate no problem.","","💯 (2)"

Now if the source of the data is from MES and it's longer term SPC analysis then ok to do it in MES.

We ended up having a 'data warehouse' (pre ""data lake"" terminology) that rolled up metrics and only kept hot data so long. You can have all the architecture in the world but if you're constantly querying huge data sets theres only so much you can do.

So we might have 2 years of historical data, but we'd use Informatica or something to pull that data into our KPIs and only store that beyond a 2-3 year period. That data would live 'forever' but it was so compressed by comparison with the raw data that it's fine.","",""

Every challenge I encounter in production is calculating OEE by shift. It might sound funny to you, but I haven’t found the correct method for this. The production facility’s shifts are changing. In fact, sometimes I worked with shifts like 23:00-07:00, which span two days.

When the shift changes, reports can become meaningless. For example, if we take a two-day report, the concept of a “day” itself changes. If we try to determine shifts dynamically in the table based on their validity times, the system becomes slow due to the large number of records. Is there a best practice for this?

I also faced an issue with recording downtimes. Splitting downtimes at the end of shifts made calculations easier. However, splitting downtimes seemed meaningless, so I performed dynamic calculations instead. For example, consider a machine:
    •    It stopped halfway through the first shift,
    •    It was completely stopped during the second shift,
    •    It started again at the beginning of the third shift.

There is no record for the second shift. However, the machine was down during that shift. I handled this by performing calculations, which worked fine, but managing dynamic shift changes became a separate problem.","",""

So data with a timestamp at 5am on Tuesday actually has ProductionDate of Monday and Shift = 3rd shift.

If the schedule is immutable and you don't want to/can't edit db schema and only have timestamp info, you can make for example a 7am-7am workday instead of midnight-midnight just through query logic.

The first two buckets are:
1. The ones that are small and will stay small.
2. The ones that are small but looking to grow.

The first one breaks down further into:

1.1. Small and Content - These guys are likely not going to invest a dime in this stuff, they are content where they already are. If the world goes digital, they hope to be retired by then.

1.2. Small with an equally small addressable market - These guys could digitize, but if they cant sell any more than they are already able to produce, they may not care to invest the time, capital, or energy into this. Some may want to do some level of digitization, but usually to increase efficiencies, maybe the goal is to get production down to a single shift. This is where architectures like what you were showing at ProveIt really shine - Low Cost, Easy to implement, and enterprise scale may never be a real concern.

1.3. Small with room to grow but a fairly low ceiling due to a small addressable market - These guys are basically in the same boat as [1.2] but will benefit a bit more directly as there is still room for sales to increase as production capacity does.

1.4. Small and looking to sell - These guys may have an idea that digitization would make them more attractive, they may freeze spending at a moments notice... I try to stay far away from these as even if they cut the budget today, the intent is all wrong and chaos ensues.

The second one is a bit more simple:

2.1. Looking to Grow ready to go - This the most fun for me - Small and Medium, they are driven to improve and view the implementation costs as a driver of that growth. Using measurable KPIs and Actionable insights to drive efficiencies in not only production but every facet of the business. From Supply Chain, to Marketing, to Production - They just want to get better at what it is they do.

2.2. Looking to Grow but not yet ready to go - They will try to minimize the budget and ask for a stack like what you were presenting at ProveIt. That stack will get them to the next step but they will pinch pennies and argue that the open source stuff is good enough - until it isnt and they scale out, often this ends in overtaxed systems failing and blame being thrown left and right... I try to avoid these situations...","","💯 (2),👍 (2)"

I keep getting questions about it, but so far, everything I’ve seen has been limited to demos. I’m trying to understand if I’m being too conservative by recommending Ignition or custom solutions instead.

On paper, SAP DM looks like it could work. But once I start analyzing real customer needs, I find myself leaning toward custom development instead of sticking to the standard—despite knowing that custom work isn’t easy either.

Even something as basic as adding a customer order detail as a column on a production order screen is quite painful at the moment. I’m sure it will improve over time, though.

They’re still trying to stabilize the edge solution; it’s not fully mature yet.

Any end goals you’re looking for? The big players will have many jobs out there (Siemens, GE, Rockwell, Apriso). Life sciences folks like Emerson. Tulip can absolutely be used for QMS and to track KPIs. 

A lot of the “low code” outside of Tulip is sequential function diagrams or BPMN. I think a lot of it would translate from one MES to another.

More often than not, it's many local MES with ad-hoc implementations. It's still a good tool for learning to ""build"".

I would qualify this with the industry verticals (and even localities) you typical support. There are not a lot of big, mass-market MES vendors. Most MES solution providers are relatively small (in terms of volume, revenue, install base). Even among the big names, they tend to have own niche or focus. Those that span a broader set of industry verticals tend to have done so through acquisition.

Examples of different industry focuses:

Plex focuses on automotive, aerospace & defense, and some food & beverage. A lot of functionality related to meeting requirements (e.g., quality, materials, delivery) of tiered industry or OEM supply chains with highly repetitive manufacturing. Large installation base in the upper midwest of US, parts of southern US, Ontario, Queretaro, Guadalajara.

MPDV focus on broader discrete manufacturing. It can handle more variety like low volume / high mix, more assembly / kitting, etc in addition to what Plex does, but less functionality to support big industry requirements. Installation base is mostly DACH.

Körber PAS-X focuses on life sciences. Customer base is big pharma. Robust batch management and record functionality. Installation base is global, but skews Europe.

Applied Materials focuses on electronics manufacturing . There is a lot of specific functionality to support fabrication processes, material management, and traceability for semiconductor manufacturing. Installation base is concentrated in East Asia.


For example, a gene therapy manufacturer is not going to use Applied Materials and Plex. An automotive supplier is not going to use PAS-X. Long story short, find an area of focus.","",""

My goal is really to learn how to build really capable operators screen where they are able to record prod, quality, manage BOM and master data, integrate with the machines and get different kpis, communicate with whoever throu this screen etc...(this is just on top of my mind) without excessive programming.

Being able to chose what i want to have but without breaking the bank and spending fortune, easy to deploy and make changes if needed and integrate everything into uns for further analyses. Maybe i just described Tulip haha.

To my knowledge so far ignition is really good for people who know what they are doing but most companied they do not have this kind of knowledge or internal resources and Plex is too out of the box.","",""

There aren't prebuilt modules for Work Orders with master data, for example. There are reference apps that can be reworked, but it's not like an MES solution with out-of-box functionality, if that makes sense. All that needs to be built out in the platform.

It's definitely a great tool for experimenting with operator screens. It's very much a ""bottoms-up"" approach to building out MES type solutions. Personally, having a bias towards repeatitive and automated manufacturing processes, I like to having the option of taking a ""top-down"" approach for some of the data models. To be effective at planning and reporting, I like consistently defined resources and constraints. There can be flexibility in how they are processed and executed. Ultimately, I want a part to always be a part. I want a control plan to inherit parts, processes, part specifications, etc. I want asset states and reasons to be consistent even if the asset and how they produce are not. I find this hard to do on app-by-app basis.

One interesting thing I've observed among some advanced Tulip users is that they will actually use Tulip to augment an MES. Tulip is basically a frontend and the MES is the backbone.

Big-name vendors seem to offer a “90% solution,” but bridging that final 10% gap often consumes the majority of time and budget.

The foundational elements of an MES—order handling, scheduling, isa95 structure, OEE—are relatively straightforward to implement, especially starting fresh in Ignition.

I used to think that as well, but I've changed my mind there in the past few years.

There's no such thing as pure COTS buy in MES, there's always need for customization.
But imo pure in-house custom development, or pure ""trust your integrator"", or a mix of both will end up more expensive than paying a license cost for tried and tested ""COTS"" software.
Unless you really only need very basic functionality maybe.

It will all be fine for a POC or a small operation, but when scaling and maintaining there will be pain.
Not to mention the cost of developing the system, yes a license might be expensive, but what's the price of a (team of) developer(s) building a custom copy from scratch that's just less tested?
Oh yeah and better keep them on board forever afterwards if you want any level of support.

Also what Rick says, and I'd go even further than that.
Buy --> relatively easy onboarding of many engineers who know the system (scaling, people leaving, leverage, ...)
Build it all from scratch --> onboarding is a pain, even if this original developer lives and stays forever

I used to work a lot with COTS MES software (and still do, insert Mitch Hedberg joke) I don't love, has many shortcomings and pains, but also has a lot of built-in functionalities that just work, tested, guaranteed and supported.

And some of the takeaways would be:
In the build vs. buy debate, it’s really asking if you want to build 60% or 40%—unless you're using Python or assembly.

A well-defined and executed ""build"" beats the pants off a poorly executed COTS—true, but the opposite is also true.

There are crap COTS MES solutions and good ones, and others in between.

To look at MES, there are 13 capabilities defined by MESA. MES Lite tends to cover the 4 core pillars of OEE, Downtime, Work Order Management, and Scheduling. And certainly, it is possible to build something reasonably basic. But how much time does it take to build an Ignition-based FCS scheduling module? Especially for the first customer.

Or Labour Management? Or building a custom Maintenance Management system?

But the real difference between a platform and a dedicated MES product is the inbuilt abstraction that allows the shop floor data that I—and many others here—think about (and which Ignition handles excellently). That makes it easier to integrate into other systems (e.g., the HR training module), because it follows an abstraction approach that is consistent with other abstraction approaches.

I have a hard time with this ""core 4"" stuff I often see here.
Sounds to me like an availibility/downtime tracking system, but with more words to make it sound important.

Let's say OEE is a core MES functionality, which I don't necessarily agree with:
-  Why is downtime a separate pillar? Isn't this part of OEE?
-  Alternatively:
  -  How do you calculate OEE without capturing quality data? I'm thinking quality definitions, sampling and/or automated reject counts
  -  How do you calculate OEE without performance data? I'm thinking defined equipment capabilities and data collection

What does scheduling entail here? Is it heavily automated/validated detailed scheduling based on product definitions, material availability, equipment capabilities, personnel requirements and so on?
Or is it an operator clicking a button to add a work order of 500 widgets for next Tuesday?

They're still kind of buying a product, but just from an SI instead of a software vendor.

The comment you replied to was more about questioning the ""Core 4"" being basically  ""OEE, and the prerequisites to calculating OEE"" as @Dylan DuFresne worded so well.
And that I don't necessarily agree with, and this is not what I think of when I'm thinking MES.

Buy vs build (or let your SI build) is not a simple black and white discussion, and for a lot of use cases I'm not sure what the best solution.

But I 100% believe MES products (i.e. licensed products, with a robust back-end, lots of customers and engineers, a track record of years of provable support and customer success, ...) definitely have their place. If you indeed only need OEE, there's relatively cheap product options for that too.

I started my MES initiative fully expecting to need to work with a SI.  We downloaded ignition, and got a quote for some key features we wanted to build. 

Specifically we needed:
- Product tracking (with visualization of where WOs are, overlaid on a map of the plant floor)
- Machine states visualized, and downtime (to feed OEE)
- Digital andon system
- Schedule tracking 
- Basic QMS functions 

The quote came in at $75K. 

At the same time myself and my controls technician got into Ignition.  We ended up building a rough but workable product within a month.  Since then we've learned a lot, and cleaned things up a lot.

The main benefit I see is that for small changes (ex: adding an asset) I can easily update the site map, and the associated functions in the MES.  With a SI that would be another PO we'd have to cut.

This was a pet project of mine, but now I'm helping the other sites do the same.  Instead of just building it for them, I'm identifying some promising engineers at each site to assist in the process.  I know the end product will not be the best at first, but as we continuously improve it will get where we need it.   And if in the future we decide to invest in a more advanced system through SIs, at least now we've identified the people we want to be involved in assisting the SIs, and we will have a much better understanding of what we want to get from our engagement with the SIs, as well as a better technical understanding of whatever the SIs develop for us.","","💯 (5),👍 (1)"

If you're modeling the events of a single array, the ""Expand Arrays"" option in Instances would let you iterate over the values of an array. The ""Expand Arrays"" option will also support multiple arrays, assuming that they're all the same size. If there are more complex requirements around data processing, you may need to do this in a pipeline. With pipelines, if your arrays are consistently sized, you can use a breakup stage and a size buffer stage (with a very short timeout) to break up the data and collect it all together. Finally if you're working with variable sized arrays and have complex requirements around data processing, I would recommend reaching out to support at that point. 4.3 will introduce enhancements that will make it easier to deal with these types of scenarios.","","👍 (1)"

Id put it at the bottom of my list.

A lot of those are solutions are technically solid but it really depends on your plans.

Best advice is hire someone to inventory the business and suggest a shortlist and selection Criteria.

If you are a single plant or a couple.
As a MES I really like GE product, that is more of a buy than a lot of people like. Id put Aveva MES next and Traksys a distant Third 

More are out  ther but I don't know them well enough to comment . But I have heard some good words about Siemens.

Ignition, Siemens OA, Aveva System platform are more platforms that you can build anything you like, including a MES. Normally what happens is you build a solution on that platform that solves your problems, but you can end up with gaps.


But honestly, if you have a good partner integrator that you trust and they know the platforms and they are proactive in offering solutions, that is what you want.

The company I work for is in the beginning stages of multiple POC's for UNS and broker based data comms viability review. I am one of the individuals in the primary group excited and engaged in these efforts. I recently brought up that we should review ISA-95 modeling beyond the basic location and asset type hierarchy so that IT apps/systems could work against a common data model rather than maintaining knowledge about data structure meaning and implementations published from the many different machine and device types in our manufacturing facilities. This seems relevant to me because we have many manufacturing domains where each domain produces a few to many different components and/or product types. Our explicit goal is to provide means for ERP/MES to close the loop on what products/components were made when and where and by whom for traceability and serialization needs in one specific domain. However, the secondary goal is to implement a common architecture or ""how"" across the company to ""quickly"" achieve similar traceability and serialization capability in other domains. My suggestion of reviewing ISA-95 modeling to achieve a common data model was met with immediate resistance with specific reasoning provided in a statement saying that, ""ISA-95 modeling is meant for use with SAP and we aren't using SAP and we can't have rigid models."" I have read through posts here for initial feedback, so to speak, from this community. I am aware of Rhize and Geoff Nunan . I am aware of David Schultz's positive opinion and use of ISA-95 and B2MML. I am also aware of Rick Bullotta's opinions on use of B2MML.

Hope that stirs the pot a little, but the reason we start with S95 is because it provide a good general abstract model that can be well understood by the vast majority of ERP implementations. Is it perfect? Fuck no, but neither are your operations.

Your goal with data-modeling is to represent your business, digitally. S95 gets you 80% of the way there, and you COULD fully model in S95... BUT THATS NOT THE DAMN POINT. We model our data to understand it better, and utilize it. S95 helps with getting a generalized granular view of your data, without going through the tedious task of modeling yourself. Plus, your interpretations of your business will change over time, and so will those models. The questions you should be asking yourself isn't ""Is S95 meant for us?"", it's ""How much do we actually understand?"" If your ERP has zero insight, S95.

It’s a bit hard to type it all but basically I started out trying to use B2MML for our UNS and found it to be too ridgid and verbose for a modern architecture. 

Instead we’ve decided to loosely follow ISA95 object models, we create our own JSON schema based on the available information (and also studying our manufacturing network which has 2 separate ERPs and at least 5 different MES’s just for managing materials at the shop floor which is where most of our SAP<>MES data is going. 

We’ve expanded beyond just level 4 to Level 3 communications and also use ISA95 and ISA88 models batch, alarm and OEE events, it will continue to be the foundation for any system integrated to our UNS - but using our own schemas. 

I’ve studied all parts of ISA95 closely and I think the naysayers have not spent much time reading beyond part 2…honestly can’t blame them it is a difficult read 😆

I really like how this image brings together the standards and how they work together in an integration framework. 

ISA88 is a lot more “sloppy” in that regard, I think it’s due for a major overhaul - the models are almost too “modular” without really giving you a clear indication how you could/should bring them together.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336189449699408/1407183107471310958/IMG_2640.png?ex=68df2ee5&is=68dddd65&hm=6664c95cd2653565290f6e439c0782c8ebcdae5686165ebaf9dc08a927a35db9&",""

Why would I convert to a common model only to have to convert back again, why not just convert directly to the target. I do understand that it's about re-use, and not building point-to-point integrations, but in this day and age of Data Hubs and persistent brokers, we are rally talking about source -> DataHub -> target.
B2MML is not suitable as the schema of a DataHub, so using B2MML means source -> B2MML -> Datahub -> B2MML -> target which jsut makes no sense to me at all.
The same is true for the Part 7 and Part 6 specs, and don't forget Part 5, 8 and 9.
I get the resistance!
We do it differently.
Source -> Data Hub, event-driven. in what ever is native to the source.
Inside the DataHub we transform the master data and formats to an isa95 based knowledge graph that is fully queryable and persistent.
DataHub -> Target, event-driven or pull, either isa95 or target specific. graphql, rest, mqtt, opc-ua.

The difference is that the logic is all inside the data hub, and there is very little impact on the source or target application, and the data in the datahub is completely queryable and persistent, versioned and standardised.

The UNS approach of building the transformations for each application and publishing json messages to a topic in a broker leaves so much value on the table becuase you can't query the broker.","","👍 (1)"

Older versions of PAS-X have an Oracle backend and support MSI. Newer versions of PAS-X have a PostgreSQL backend, MSI interface, PAS-X Data Access (""PDA"") for analytics/reporting, and the standard API for config and app-level methods.

It seems like most of the install base is still running the older versions.

The most common flavor of MSI is the OPC UA version based off some ISPE working group standard. Many of Körber's machine builder partners in Europe support this. This handles the Controls<->MES scenarios you mentioned. I believe in the MSI module there is a way to configure the routing of messages to different parts of PAS-X.

Having MQTT support in an MES is not as useful as it may sound. Modbus register values sent over MQTT are still modbus register values. MES ultimately need manufacturing events (e.g., batch events, state changes, BOM loaded, container depleted). If the MES lacks processing facilities to effectively convert and remediate telemetry into your desired transactions, it's protocol support is of limited value. If it can do this, there is still quite a bit of work. In other words, focus more on ""payload"" and less on ""protocol"". Don't select an MES because it does or does not support MQTT. Use an MES that fits your business, manufacturing processes, and how your requirements may evolve. If the MES can't do those things well, adapting protocols will be the least of your troubles.

For example, Sepasoft and Kanoa are built on Ignition. They sit on top of and interpret Ignition tag providers. Ignition tag providers are flexible in terms of being able to bind to MQTT, OPC UA, PLC drivers, etc. But, if these solutions aren't a good fit for your manufacturing processes, the integration benefits don't really matter.

Sometimes those pipelines are ""south"" of L3 and sometimes those are ""north"" of it. Below L3, this could involve calling an MES endpoint to record production when an OPC tag indicates the end of a cycle or a counter is equal to a standard count. Above L3, this could involve simple replication of MES to a data lake. Or it could be used to construct contextualized data sets that enrich process data (e.g., temp, pressure, position) with MES context (e.g., lot, operator, work order info) for analytics.

With respect to the PAS-X MSI, that's a generic messaging interface and could be applied to many things. The southbound patterns could be anything from writing setpoints or recipes to acquiring data from instrumentation. 

Suppose you're a PAS-X shop and you've standardized on bioreactors from one of Körber's partners. These bioreactors have an onboard OPC UA Server that support the MSI / ISPE integration pattern. This is working well and it really streamlines MES integration. Now, suppose there is a delivery backlog on those bioreactors or your firm just acquired another manufacturer that did not standardize on these bioreactors. You suddenly have a fleet of bioreactors with secondary instrumentation (e.g., cell counters) that only expose their data as obscure text files. How do you make file servers, filled with a ton of text files constantly being created and appended to, fit into your existing integration pattern you intially standardized on? Create an abstraction layer. Build an API. Now, regardless of underlying data sources, the MES can easily fetch instrumentation readings when it needs it. No need to write an RFQ for the machine builder or third-party to build a new interface when they hopefully are available in 15 months.

But what I found over time that might not be as useful as it sounds, normally from any source I want to add some context into my data as I transmit it to the UNS. So as a simple example, if I have two flow meters , one Modbus and one MQTT , I am probably still going to use some sort of gateway to take that data, structure the payload, and publish it in the correct level in my semantic hierarchy.

so for the Modbus, I typically will publish all the registers into a      Something/Something/something/Something/Device/Raw  and process it out form there, I tend to do the same even with a MQTT device and publish  the data to                                 Something/Something/something/Something/Device2/Raw and process it out from there.

with higher level systems like a MES , CMMS, great if I can easily configure my system to publish the data in context in the payload form that I want, but I would rather have something that can get the data I need and add the context to allow me use whatever solutions is best for me. and having a interface that allow me publish MQTT but is very manual to configure can be more work than just using an API to retrieve the date from the tables and Parse it out and publish to MQTT, 

At some point in Scaling you will need some sort of platform that can collect the date , model it and deliver it to other systems, with a level of structure and governance, and the options available Like HighByte, MaestoHub and Flow software, generally can connect to most things in a better and faster way.","",""

I understand the need for a data orchestration platform to ensure the contextualisation is done in a uniform way and ensure scale 
Do we see the need for an MDM platform in the level 2 and level 3 for data governance? 
Data loss in edge is a fact so I am wondering do we use tricks like store and forward or do we need something more sophisticated.","",""

Decoupling the integration process can be seen as advantage to be more open, and I think this is so important for MES as the device protocols are more proprietary, whereas any enterprise system are using mainly TCP protocols to connect: SOAP or Rest / JSON. Integration protocols in level 4 and up are simpler","",""

My understand is that Flow is kind of like a multi-system ""event frames"". It creates time-bound events (based on schedules/rules) against telemetry and historian data and those get persisted in its own embedded SQL database for visualization, analysis, reporting, etc within the app. Beyond this, there is an option of providing these events to external reporting databases or BI tools.

I didn't get the impression that it was a pipelining solution. I've never heard of someone using it as middleware to egress transactions and feed apps. I thought its egress was analytics to storage or visualization. For example, aggregate queries on a historized telemetry (e.g., tank level by hour, shift, day, week).

Am I understanding it right?","",""

 I tend to mentally bucket it as providing that information modelling and allowing what I consider higher order analytics from multiple data sources, but it solves that need in a ery different way to HightByte and MaestroHub","",""

"1073312001788477471","sparkylarks","2025-09-24T17:36:22.1460000+08:00","I tend to enforce data governance mostly by procedure, but I’ve started to add some technical controls as well, such as:
      Checking the payload structure before publishing (to make sure messages conform to schema).
      Restricting nodes to publish only to specific topics (to prevent topic sprawl).

Whether you need formal Master Data Management (MDM) controls really depends on scale:
     For a POC with a few lines, you can usually manage with procedures and light validation.
     For multi-plant deployments, stronger enforcement (via tools like HighByte, Litmus, or MaestroHub) is probably necessary.

And I work on small POC projects typically 

On the edge side (PLC and devices), you’re always transmitting a lot of data, and even in a plant network you’ll see micro outages that lead to data loss.
If you need to capture critical values at the PLC (e.g., 100% of test results on a high-speed line), this can be a problem.

Over the years I’ve used several approaches:
PLC-based FIFO buffers of up to 100 records that stop the process if they fill (guaranteeing no loss, but complex to implement).
In other cases, simply accepting the loss when connections drop (lower risk use cases).

Today my preferred approach is:
     Use edge devices that can buffer locally, or  Add a small DIN-rail IoT device dedicated to buffering. ( I love adding Din Rail Edge computer)
    And if you’re going Edge → Cloud, then some sort of buffering is almost always needed.
    HiveMQ Edge to HiveMQ Cloud works well here (with built-in store-and-forward).
    A simpler alternative of Node-RED with a Postgres table for local persistence and replay can work really well","",""

Also part of this suite of tools is the Integration Engine which will push these now stored events and aggregated values to other data consumers and allow you the flexibility to define the namespace and payload in doing so. This includes MQTT brokers, Kafka streams, cloud platforms, other SQL dbs, etc. The REST API can be used to query all stored events and aggregated values as well as query the databases and systems Flow Models are connected to, returing the raw data from historians or SQL dbs.

When we release Timebase Atlas later this year, Flow as well as other applications will be able to subscribe to Timebase Atlas models and get values on change (event driven architecture).","",""
