How can you remotely force disconnection between the Greengrass Core device and connected OT-IT device?

Pick all that apply:

[ ] A - revoke the OT-IT device certificate
[ ] B - deactivate the OT-IT device certificate
[ ] C - rotate the Greengrass Group Certificate Authority certificate
[ ] D - remove OT-IT from Greengrass Group definition","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751486645378875563/752384155030913106/gg_subscriptions-ggc_ggad_quiz.png?ex=68df5059&is=68ddfed9&hm=fc71298615105ed4d9ae874e03780ecb3929e19e92c1811b38ea47c1531837f5&",""

- The whole idea of a Greengrass Core Device is that it can connect securely via TLS to AWS IoT Core and the devices behind it are just sending data to the device
- Thus the OT-IT devices do not have AWS certs that can revoked or deactivated
- Rotating the Greengrass group cert won't do anything to stop OT-IT from sending data
- By removing the OT-IT device from the Greengrass Group definition then the Greengrass Core Device will disconnect and stop listening to OT-IT","",""
"698244484302897323","lmtx","2020-09-08T12:57:54.4790000+08:00","@mrjain. thank you for your answer, let me add some comments:
- ""OT-IT devices do not have AWS certs that can revoked or deactivated"" - every Greengrass Aware Device (GGAD) that communicates with Greengrass Core Device (GGC) needs to be registered in AWS IoT as a Thing; that Thing needs to have a x509 Certificate attached to it in AWS IoT; GGAD is using `device private key`, `device certificate` and `group CA certificate` to establish TLS encrypted MQTT communication with GGC; BUT GGC is not validating with AWS IoT if that certificate was revoked/deactivated during connection setup with GGAD (which is design mistake in my opinion); that is why GGAD needs to have a certificate but it can be revoked/deactivated and that would not stop GGAD from connecting to GGC
- ""Rotating the Greengrass group cert won't do anything to stop OT-IT from sending data"" - actually rotation of `Greengrass Group CA certificate` does two things: 1) disconnects all GGAD from GGC; 2) rotates Group CA certificate; as a result GGAD can not establish connection with GGC because it will have outdated certificate; the only way to re-enable communication between GGAD and GGC is to execute Greengrass Discovery in order to obtain new Group CA certificate; typically in IIoT GGAD (OT-IT) device can not access internet so will not be able to execute Discovery, as a solution you need to have other server (it can be GGC) to execute Discovery and transfer the Group CA certificate to GGAD (it can be done different ways depending on your security requirements)
- ""removing the OT-IT device from the Greengrass Group definition"" - yes, you have to remove GGAD from all Greengrass Group Subscriptions it is part of, then remove from Greengrass Group and trigger Group Deployment in order to update the Greengrass Group Definition at the GGC device

so the correct answers are C and D

let me know if you have any questions regarding this quiz or GGAD <-> GGC connectivity","","üëç (2)"

@Walker Reynolds Securing data means protecting it from unauthorized access. For me I prefer that to mean the data is encrypted during transfer and then secured with good passwords and 2 factor authentication. I get less concerned about sharing a disk in the cloud with other users and side attacks. For a massive company who is a big target, I would probably be more concerned and either keep my data on premise or use dedicated cloud services.

Data security is 100% valuable even if it costs some efficiency and opportunity. Data is a competitive advantage for a 4.0 manufacturer. There could be some benefit in ""sharing"" your data if there is a mutual share back. Like a machine learning algorithm that uses data from multiple companies to make everyone better than they could be on their own. I'm a big fan of open source hardware and software, I have generated a lot of it myself, but data is different than source code.

IT professionals have a bad rep because they (not all of them) tend to be in a mental silo. It seems to me, the people who tend towards IT become nerds about their respective field and fail to see the forest for the trees. This is a trap a lot of engineers fall into as well. There is also a certain arrogance in engineers/IT where they tend to think everyone else is a moron and only they are competent at their jobs. Although a bit of arrogance/confidence is a good trait, when you combine that with failing to take in the whole system, you get professionals who are difficult to work with.","","üëç (1)"

@Walker Reynolds I would say that ""securing your data"" starts with designing and implementing proper authentication + authorization between your devices and  between devices and external systems; if you design your system in a proper way you will not sacrifice a lot of efficiency because you keep your data secure (actually there is no other option than to keep your system safe); a proper keys/certificates management and granular policies usually take you 90% the way; remote maintenance of locked-down facilities brings additional challenges but that is totally different topic

bad reputation of ""security experts"" comes from the fact that making security right is not a trivial task and many people I know cover their lack of real knowledge with arrogance and pretend that ""they know it all so you are not allowed to ask any questions""; on the other hand the best security experts I met were always open for feedback and were not afraid of admitting that they does not know some specific topic","",""

@Walker Reynolds Securing data for me means making sure the data is safely stored and safely transferred, without creating impossible restrictions such as a data silo. It means using a organized and scalable (if needed) authentication and authorization according to today standards and making sure possible threats and patches are always being handled. For me there is a minimal level of security that must be achieved as requirement, but beyond that is always a cost benefit situation. IT professionals usually don't understand OT, especially 3.0 architecture, so they are an obstacle for example when you want to implement Modbus on the network as the only viable option and they refuse because of encryption. Or when they ask the project to have environments of DEV, Validation and Production on all levels when you don't have PLCs for just production and validation. Also, when it happens is that their work motivation is fear, not innovation, so they fear any change.","","üíØ (1),üëç (1)"

@Walker Reynolds  I have used AD account authentication (Kerberos) all the time from the data source integration to database server, client applications, even for third party applications.  This helps to restrict the access to data. Honestly I am not aware encryptions and decryption of the stored data and data in transition.

Ignition Edge is a really solid option for HMIs.  The visualization modules, Vision and Perspective, are pretty hard to beat.

In practice, safety applications will require e-stop buttons and other safety devices within close proximity of where there is danger.  There is something I wanted to additionally point out for the thread.  I sometimes use this as an example to skeptics that don't ""trust"" automation networks for even non-safety applications.

While wireless safety on a standard tablet is not possible, wireless safety is possible on a safety-rated HMI.  There exist HMIs with safety fieldbus interfaces (e.g., EtherNet/IP CIP Safety, PROFINET PROFIsafe).  They look like pendants with e-stop buttons on them.

Wireless safety is entirely possible.  Most of the major fieldbus technologies support it.  Just like hardwired safety system ""checks"" its integrity (e.g., pulsing, redundant contacts), a safety fieldbus will check the integrity of its network.  If the integrity is not there, it's a safety event and the process is shutdown.  While not a good fit for everyone, it's technically possible.  It's possible, but it constrains the asset's reliability to the reliability of the network.  There are obvious pros and cons to this.

The thing that I'm more curious about is how one keeps a mobile OS on a tablet stable and secure for an industrial environment.

The most exposed point of shop floor system is the Edge Gateway (the server that can access external network i.e. some domains on the public internet). You might consider creating a honeypot that emulates Edge Gateway but in my opinion there is very little value in that. Edge Gateway should be located behind a very restricted Fire Wall (basically all incoming traffic should be dropped) and Outbound Proxy (so it can access only specified domains and can not communicate with any arbitrary domain/ip on the public internet). So if you make your honeypot Edge Gateway more exposed that that no one will believe that this is the real endpoint (at least no one that has some understanding of IIoT security).
You might consider creating a honeypot that pretends to be an IT system on the internal network. In that case you will detect an attack if someone hacked your Edge Gateway and will try access that ""fake system"". If that is the case your setup is not designed in a correct way. All bells and whistles should go off if your Edge Gateway is starting some abnormal activity (and you do not need any honeypot for that). Credentials for IT systems should be stored on the Edge Gateway in encrypted manner - if someone compromise your Edge Gateway then should not be able to extract credentials and access IT systems
You might consider creating a honeypot that pretends to be an OT-IT system. In securely design solution, OT-IT layer drops all traffic from the Edge Gateway anyway. The OT-IT should always be the active part of connection (OT-IT connects to Edge Gateway, verifies if that is valid endpoint and send/receive data at the last step). So creating a fake OT-IT does not make much sense in my opinion.
Generally speaking, you should design your system with the assumption, that the most exposed parts will be compromised (even though that you will do your best to defend them). That is why you should isolate them","",""
"698244484302897323","lmtx","2021-04-12T03:53:22.3230000+08:00","The same approach should be used when you design the cloud backend. You should use multiple isolated accounts. The most exposed is usually called the Ingest Account - it accepts connections from the Edge Gateway (or any IoT device in general). Because of that this account can (potentially) get compromised and you do not want to loose business data or your proprietary ML models as a result. That is why Ingest Account should be used only to receive data and sent it to other account (let's call it a Datalake Account). Attacker should not be able to extract data from the Datalake Account even if was able to access the Ingest Account. You should use separate Monitoring Account to check activity in all other accounts and trigger an alert if something weird is happening. The same concept here - Monitoring Account has (limited) access to the Ingest and Datalake Accounts but those accounts can not access the Monitoring Account.
The cloud architecture is usually way more complex that this example but I believe it represents my point üòâ

When designing your system, it's important to approach cybersecurity from a ***HOLISTIC*** point of view. What do I mean by this? While there are plenty of discussions around technology as it pertains to part 3-3 of IEC 62443 standard, it is *equally* important to also evaluate other dimensions of protection based on *process* and *people*. This is where the concept of **Protection Levels (PL)** comes into play. 

Protection levels provide an integrated evaluation of the fulfillment of: 
1. **technical measures **(e.g. ISA/IEC 62443-**3-3** SL 1 - SL 4) and 
2. **related organizational measures** (e.g. ISA/IEC 62443-**2-1** for the operational policies and procedures + ISA/IEC 62443-**2-4** for the integration and maintenance activities) 

The maturity of the organization to document and implement the organizational requirements will be evaluated and rated based on their Maturity Level (ML 1 - ML 4). When assesing both the technology measures (SL) and process & people (ML) combined, only then you can determine where you stand based on an overall protection level (PL1 - PL4).

Although It could be possible to include all requirements in one protection level, as security includes many (often independent) dimensions, the significance of that value could be questionable. A better approach is to group related requirements into slices. A slice includes related requirements of part 2-1, 2-4, and 3-3 and addresses one security dimension. The protection value of a given slice reflects how good the IACS is protected regarding the security dimension of the slice.

It was a directed attack with massive governmental resources behind it, not an organization out to encrypt your files and ask for a ransom to unlock it. It was tailor made to interfere operations of certain ABB drives (if my memory serves me correctly). Governments and large global organizations are way more likely to be subject to the kind of attacks that requires these types of resources.","","üîí (1)"

These days you can go to BlackHat and take a course on hacking ICS, they even give you a PLC and software to take away and practice on.

All that said, the number of published occasions when an ICS system has been hacked is vanishingly small. It‚Äôs usually something in IT that has a knock-on effect or, rarely, the ‚ÄòIT‚Äô machines in the ‚ÄòOT‚Äô environment running HMI etc.

Colonial and JBS are interesting examples. Based on what little we really know the decision to shut down OT was a commercial one because of issues in IT. There‚Äôs a hint that a single PC in the OT world was affected at Colonial but the main problem was in the billing system.","",""

As manufacturers and equipment providers, we have a responsibility to our customers and the public to disclose product vulnerabilities along with their risks and recommended mitigation steps to address those vulnerabilities. Many vendors already provide this information. For example, as part of the ongoing effort to help operators manage security risks and keep systems protected, Siemens ùôãùôßùô§ùôôùô™ùôòùô©ùòæùôÄùôçùôè discloses the required information necessary for operators to assess the impact of a security vulnerability.
 
Part of these advisories include what is called a ""Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)"" score. CVSS is an industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing respondents to prioritize responses and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several metrics that approximate ease of exploit and the impact of exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe.  The manufacturer of the product usually provides the base score.  Respondents are encouraged to *complete* the calculation by adding the environmental and temporal scores, based upon their own unique environment, and use the results to prioritize their risk response.

Here are some links that can provide additional details and support on this topic:

The good thing about this is that you can integrate this directly into several HMIs  (at-least that is what I've heard - not seen it). Also 2 important things to consider before you embark on this expensive journey is (a) is your network architecture ready for such a passive discovery solution (the older your network is the harder it gets and you'll end up re-architecting your network or running expensive cable runs across your production environment (b) do you have resources in-house to manage such a solution and understand the logs its generates and act on it.

From what I have seen there are some stages IT Cyber security analyst goes through:  

1) ""WTF Mate !?!, what's this PLC thing? I'll escalate to the site engineer"" 
2) ""ok done ICS training, still don't know what's going on, ill escalate to the site engineer"" 
3) "" (2 years in) I am getting pretty good at understanding anomalous situations within ICS/OT, but I dont know if this is legitimate or not, ill escalate to the site engineer"" 

without them seeing the change management, they're blind. How many organisations have I seen with  decent ICS / OT Change management ?  Two in my entire career. 

So what tends to happen at SoC's is they try to create five use cases  per year where they just knock out the an alerts generated. 

SoC's They tend to get frustrated with the site engineers, but the engineers are usually under paid, over worked, and dont have the time to remediate SoC tickets. 

dedicated OT SOC, probably the better way to go, where you have decent ICS Knowledge which can speak engineer to resolve actions. But few go down that path.

embedded systems, your at the mercy of the hardware and software engineers, so aside from patching, you've got to use architecture and network segmentation/segregation to limit access, plus again monitoring.

IOhub can be installed in a preexisting environment where the security systems should be already in place protecting your machine network. IOhub can be also installed in router mode. When configured in router mode the IOhub device acts as a firewall and every device in the machine network is isolated by default. Basing on the security policy you have defined you can also allow your device to reach the customer network or internet but as a best practice, I would not recommend letting them exit the machine network. The IOhub device doesn't have an administrative interface. It is a blind device. It is contacting the EZ VPN server only from which it collects the necessary IOhub configuration, dockers container, or VPN configuration. So by design, it is really secure. The IOhub application is built with a stack of Docker containers offering sometimes a web interface. While configured in router mode the administrator defines if the IOhub application can be access from outside the machine network or not. For any additional security information about IOhub feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to answer you. Hope I have clarified your doubts.","","ezvpn (1)"

This included examining whet existing 62443 requirements and methods for validating these requirements under existing certification programs are necessary and sufficient for the IIoT environment.

Cybersecurity is not my area of expertise. I am curious how the technology discussed in this community addresses cybersecurity and if/how it relates to the IEC standard. What I have learned is to architect a system where the technology is inherently secure. For instance, an MQTT broker uses outbound connections with SSL and server/client certificates. The IOhub bakes in security through a provisioning process, again without opening ports.

It's possible, but risky when it comes to liability, insurance and also may end up being a complicated design/architecture - same can be said for security (kinda).

Likewise there are certifications for compliance to IEC62443-4-1 which ensures that products are developed securely (no tampering or mishandling of firmware during manufacturing or development process is an example of where this is applicable). But these parts of the standard are intended for product manufacturers (e.g. Siemens, Rockwell, Phoenix, etc.) to design products based off globally accepted secure practices/guidelines. The consequence of that is that vendors will use this as a way to market ""how secure their products are"" (or howuch money they have - depending on your perspective). It's not to say that products without this certification are NOT secure, but you can at least infer that products with these certifications have undergone testing by independent 3rd parties (e.g. T√úV Sud/Reihnland)to verify that they are secure to a certain level.","","ü§ü (1)"

Inspired by @henning I looked into AMRC Factory+ that has an I4.0 litterature overview supporting most of the thinking in this Discord. However, I stumbled upon this Security section comparing OPC-UP and MQTT.  *""OPC-UA is secure by design and comprises of both the CIA and AAA triade framework concepts as follows: 1. Confidentiality (Messages are encrypted at the transport layer) 2. Integrity (Messages are signed at the transport layer) 3. Availability (Messages are restricted in size and no security-related codes are returned) 4. Authentication (Authentication via username and password or x.509 certificate on application layer) 5. Authorisation (Address space is controlled by access rights, permissions and roles) 6. Accountability (Auditable).  IIRA explains how OPC-UA and MQTT are both equally desirable and fit for purpose in factory communications other than in the security domain where OPC-UA is the clear winner due to in-built security features. This is primarely due to MQTT having no encryption by default making the sending of plaintext MQTT payloads over the internet unacceptable for most applications without the addition of payload encryption.""* See attached section. This is not how I understand the security discussion of MQTT as the main architecture protocol. Can someone enlighten me if above statement of MQTT security is correct.

It adheres to best practices in the cyber security world. The BSI and other agencies have given it the seal of approval. In practice, most implementations are essentially just transport security. Application layer feature sets are extremely limited in most products. In general, it‚Äôs half-baked that many resort to disabling the security if they can. Many find that managing all the x.509 certs without a certificate authority (i.e., GDS) is a nightmare and give up. 

Even though the spec technically makes security compulsory (which is great), many products have ways to bypass it due to all the interoperability issues caused by variations in implementation of the spec. I once remember a Rockwell product manager openly discussing the ability to bypass security is really important to customers of its OPC-UA interface. It bothered me in principle, but I couldn‚Äôt blame them. If they did not provide the option, their product would not work at all in some environments. It‚Äôs a reality.

MQTT has no security by design. It relies on TLS (and whatever evolves to replacing it for securing TCP). Beyond this, brokers can control access to topics.

The statement about MQTT above is technically true in the same way that HTTP is not secure. That doesn‚Äôt stop the banking, commerce, healthcare, or the internet at large from using HTTP though. They simply secure it with TLS.","","üíØ (4)"

These are organisations that have already implemented either TLS tunnels or IPSec from site to site. 

The other two lightbulb moments for end users get is the complex nature of running and maintains certificates, then try the PSK route and realise that's hard to manage too. Then they want to monitor the environment with a ICS/OT network IDS, as baselining an ICS/OT environment is a  great way to see risk, which functionality is greatly reduced when encryption is deployed. 

in my biased opinion  you'll use OPC-UA at the Edge, and MQTT at the edge and everywhere else, because its easier to use. 

I mean you could watch a video on MQTT with and without TLS and get the jist in 20mins, OPC-UA with all its features sets not so. 

As a control system engineer I gravitated to OPC-UA cause I was used to OPC Classic. I think you will find most engineers head that way without education, security is going to be a distant requirement for product and technology selection here. just my 2 cents...","","üëç (1)"

The sense I get is that Software Defined Networks is like having firewalls on each port of your network switch. No more vlans, no more subnet concerns.

In the SDN Controller, it can see all the devices and what ports they are connected to across multiple switches. The default is Deny All, and the engineer selects which devices can communicate with other devices and on what protocols (even port numbers don't matter!)

Also can create zones, such as HMI and PLC, have devices join the zone, and make a rule for HMI to communicate with PLC zones.

The ‚Äúoptimisation‚Äù will effectively create a set of 15 minute time series setpoints for say 24-48 hours in the future. These setpoints will get subscribed to via a UNS Validated (via control rules) and sent to plant and equipment via an edge device to the local PLC. The local PLC will also validate that the setpoints are within sensible limits for the plant and within its current capability. The OT and IT Security team have been told that all control has to be within the OT environment. My issue is we can‚Äôt move all the things that feed the ‚Äúoptimisation‚Äù into OT. Things like Static Network Models, Weather data (external), Quality data, maintenance data etc so I feel that the ‚Äúoptimisation‚Äù is just the last leg of the compute function in a fully autonomous series chain.

I think there is a different in viewpoints here regarding security in OT systems. I agree that cybersecurity is to be tackled on day one.

So I design cybersecurity architecture in critical infrastructure and civil engineering projects, where basically I determine what cybersecurity has to *look like* for lets say a Rail Traction Power Sub-Station, a State DOT's Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, Water Treatment Facilities, etc. My goal from the very beginning is to always figure out how the physical side of things can either cause damage or cause loss of life, and then work back from there. One thing we started to do was instead of treating Cybersecurity as a technology-specific endeavor, we shove our way into the safety programs of these engagements to cover the widest swathe as possible. If a safety incident can occur by happenstance, then that incident needs to be looked at under the scrutiny of a security lens too.

My overall point I want to make is this: **Critical Infrastructure or not, if your processes have the possibility to make someone go ""Ouchie!"" or get un-alive, and you choose NOT to employ cybersecurity, then you're grossly negligible.**","","üëç (2)"

This is where we need to determine acceptable /tolerable risk. i would deem a Wordpress site as a given  intolerable risk. Ransomware 250 workstations probably intolerable too, But when risk assessments are done and compared against business goals you technically get much better momentum for change (scenarios above unlikely to transpire). 

""if business is informed of the risks and consequences they will also say no"" usually when this happens the risk hasn't been communicated properly, that being said you  could communicate perfect risk assessments and remediation reports to the leadership/board,  and some will still say no they aren't ready to hear what you have to say. You can only help the ones ready to be helped end of the day. Control system engineers are a good example, they probably don't understand brute force attempts and what that means, they are aware of risk though especially around the product and process that they are responsible for, whats lacking here again is effective communication

IT should get a problem, and figure out a secure solution to the (connectivity) problem.

1) Business Risk needs to be quantified and appropriate controls provided

2) IT Best practices have failed OT for along time now, you can do them but with modification, and if you modified an IT best practice for your OT environment is it still an IT Best practice or is it an OT best practice?  either way follow point #1 it will determine the controls/countermeasures you will need.

3) CIP Secure and the like wont help you as much as you think, for an advanced / mature OT Security organisation ... maybe, but if you do the risk assessments you'll see your better off spending your org's money elsewhere... again follow point #1 which may call for end to end PLC to PLC encryption.
 
4) Is OT Cyber Security over hyped ? yes and no, it is talked about a lot, but still not taking seriously, that being said you can reduce a lot of risk in OT with simple best practices  

5) You will be amazed at how much risk reduction you get when you starting monitoring your OT environment, identify your assets, and figure out what they are and are not supposed to be doing.

I do some part time work for a construction material producing division of a larger business network of the Owner.
The division is headed by a General Director and a director for each factory. 
I report to Director A and the General Director.
One of the newer factories has an ongoing MES implementation project, which I was not involved in until a few weeks ago because Director B was completely capable of managing the project.
That is until the Owner fired Director B and his most competent reports for suspicions of *industrial espionage* a few months ago.

That's when the MES project went from burning to crashing.
The General Director asked me to support the internal (IT) Project Manager from corporate to implement at least some functionality
of the MES MVP phase, to not waste the 400K already sunk. Especially materials usage and data gathering for automated label printing for the pallets.

But now the well is poisoned because the System integrator was recommended by Director B, and the Owner suspects that they will 
build a backdoor into the MES to exfiltrate material usage and recipe data... on how to mix concrete (which I understand won't
work always even if you use the same raw materials and suppliers)

If I think about ""What would Walker do?"" I could imagine him not being involved at all because this organization is not 
mature enough to have even a simple Industry 3.0 MES.

What do you even do when the customer becomes paranoid mid implementation?
Do you advise about data obfuscation? I can't really because it's about the main Integrator.
Cut the scope and get a new integrator?

tldr: I advise the end user on MES implementation, but the Owner suspects the System integrator will insert backdoors for industrial espionage,

It is more related to permissions than it is to security but I couldn't find a better topic. I don't see data in a company being readily available in the data ecosystem, to everyone. It can work in at an OT level but, when we include costs or HR data, that is not desirable.  We've imagined a system where each object (variable, table, etc.) would have its permissions defined by the datasource (or, if not possible, at the gateway) and those permissions would be propagated along with the object in its metadata as a string (something like: ""Group1:R;Group2:RW"") in the JSON payload, through the MQTT broker reaching all the consumer nodes (borrowed the string idea from somewhere else ). These consumer nodes, in turn, would have to enforce those permissions granting access if the user  requesting access (or a service account used to run an application) authenticated in the AD belonged to a group with read permissions to the object. The problem is that, apparently, systems like gateways (I'm referring to Ignition in particular), MQTT brokers, historians and MQTT subscriber capable systems in general are not ready to implement such a mechanism (at least without a lot of scripting).

One approach could be encrypting sensitive data at the source with a private key, so PII/HR types of sensitive data could flow through the same pipeline as OT data, and until it's decrypted downstream by the allowed downstream consumer, the encrypted content is still visible publicly, and thus protected. 

Another approach is having a data classification strategy (e.g. tier 1,2,3), and control access for certain types of data, rather than trying to pass along an ontology of permissions. For example, all data is sent through the same stream/broker/etc. and is tier 1. Nobody except admins have access to tier 1.

The approach I have taken is that VLAN become groups of devices that talk to each other a lot but not to devices outside the VLAN. If possible the I have an aggregators that talks out to the network . That might be a PLC that has 2 NICS oen internal to talk to the local devices and one on the Plant Network

That plant network is normally segmented, by functional group, maybe some PLC's that talk together, or maybe they are just in a geographic area.

any traffic from one VLAN on the Production Network to another is through the firewall and you need to write done the ports you need opened , and the end points. IT have a matric then that stops people closing ports transmitting vital information.

When data then needs to go from the Production to the Corporate network, that was the place where there was normally a DMZ and database replications and lots of things I thought a bit over kill. Using VRF instead of ACL did seam to be a more sensible approach for larger installations certainly, and allowing traffic through the DMZ for the defined routes was simpler.. 

Today that where it is normally MQTT traffic I want to get from the Production to the Corporate network, I have seen clients , just open the ports and allow the single outbound connection through the firewall to a Corporate Broker from Production nodes, or I have seen a Broker at the Production level and another at corporate, and I have seen the Broker in the DMZ.

Not sure if any of those are more or less secure, as long as I have the data going where I need it, I let the security people decide how that will be achieved.","","üíØ (1),üëç (1)"

Its why MQTT is great to implement as it punches out of a firewall so to speak. As for safety nothing quite like relay logic, but SIS systems are routinely on thier own PHYSICAL network for communication ideally, if its SIS<->PLC   usually serial connection, SIS<->Engineering Workstation that's using again a physical network. 

Encryption does fuck all, based on the risk assessments ive seen, unless your connecting the plantfloor to either a) corp or b) cloud, it is minimal risk reduction. There are far better things to perfect before going down the encryption rabbit hole. I am not the only one who has done risk assessments and come up with that answer, people all over the world have. That doesnt mean ""do not encrypt your MQTT Client in plant to MQTT broker in Corporate"" thats just the opposite of what I just said (text can be hard to convey points at time).

I hadn't realized that the Talk2M setup for eWons actually routed all communications through their cloud broker.  I thought - like the TosiBox - the broker just authenticated and setup the VPN, and then it was point-to-point.

Microsoft Defender is pretty crap for OT (probably IoT too), you don't get much for what you pay for, although I am sure the sales guys would disagree with me. 

Best approach for prevention is network segmentation (this can be done with firewalls and Layer 3 Managed siwtches with ACL's on the plant floor), if your looking for some ability to detect malicious behavior SYSMON from microsoft is free, may require a little customization. 

If you want COTS, then the best in class, in no particular order is Nozomi Networks, Dragos, Claroty. 

If you want decent enough protection Airlock Digital  (application allow listing) will suffice for any Linux / Windows device, from Windows XP above including server editions, its why it works so well for OT. 


Network Segmentation/ Seperation does wonders, following that application allow listing works great in the sense your not constantly updating all the time so offers some great protection from that perspective.","","üëç (1)"

You really actually need to come up with the business requirements before anyone can fully help you.

We did this through firewall management (allowing, not allowing outside access the the eWon) but that had excessive network admin costs with calls to the help desk to enable, which might take hours to implement).  My understanding (again - I haven't used it but I know Intellic has) with TosiBox, the customer can manage the keys but it imposes no real extra burden on the vendor.  Same with Tailscale.

Sorry if this was discussed before. I am curious what PKI solution you are using to manage certificates? Lot of applications has a web-GUI, that means you need TLS certificates for encrypted https communications, and certificates must be trusted. With OPC UA even  harder - you need not only server side certificate, but also client must have a certificate trusted by the server. when you use MQTT broker, SQL server , or communicate over REST API - everywhere you need a certificate.
Perhaps free PKI provider like Lets'Encrypt is suitable on some cases, but what of you are running in isolated network, and neither web server not DNS server are not accessible for Let'sEncrypt to validate your applications identity. 
One simple solution probably just everywhere use self-signed certificates, or none-secure connections, but this is not the best one I guess.","",""

We're seeking advice on bolstering the cybersecurity posture of our remote PLC access setup.

Current Infrastructure:
- Remote Access: Teltonika RMS for VPN connectivity to client sites.
- VPN Protocol: Standard OpenVPN, with .ovpn profiles downloaded from RMS to technician laptops running OpenVPN Connect client.
- On-site PLCs: Primarily Siemens S7-1500, but solutions must also be applicable to Allen Bradley (ControlLogix/CompactLogix) PLCs.
- RMS Account Security: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for access to our Teltonika RMS management account.

Core Cybersecurity Concern:
Our primary concern, shared by our clients, is the potential for an unauthorized actor to gain access to a technician's laptop (e.g., via loss, theft, or malware) and subsequently use the stored OpenVPN profile to establish a VPN connection to the site. This could allow them to connect to and potentially manipulate the on-site PLCs. While 2FA on the RMS account protects the management of VPN users and profile downloads, it doesn't inherently secure an already downloaded .ovpn file for each connection attempt from the OpenVPN client.","",""

So the alternative would be to launch my own OpenVPN server and config it the way I want. I am not an expert in this domain, that is why I like the plug-and-play nature of Teltonika's RMS services.

I think that sometimes people use the term ‚ÄúDMZ‚Äù as shorthand for ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about security‚Äù ‚Äî but what really matters is how well those boundaries are actually implemented.

 I sometimes feel the  DMZ image ‚Äî an empty zone, between countries  where noone lives ‚Äî can give the wrong impression.

I prefer to think in terms of three distinct security domains:

    Plant Floor: The OT zone ‚Äî PLCs, SCADA, drives, safety systems.
    Manufacturing Integration Network: MES, historians, MQTT brokers, edge compute, engineering tools (e.g. PLC programming software).
    Business Systems Zone: ERP and other business applications, which may or may not be further segregated from general IT systems.

In addition, I'm quite interested in this discuss as I'm conflicted internally on the best approach as well as what the future will likely hold. 

We opted for IT/OT network segregation with a DMZ. Obviously, it can make a lot of sense for segregation especially for critical infrastructure. I find that some of the key drawbacks are user management, access to essential data/applications/integrations, and application and network alerts. IT has workflows and solutions for user onboarding/management/offboarding. Duplicating these efforts or ignoring entirely for shared logins increases security risks. IT has application and network alerting solutions. Leveraging those tools can be quite helpful on OT servers. Leaving these things up to OT engineers makes their job harder and potentially leaves the OT network less secure. IT also needs to make sure they are not making OT engineers job harder and are actually serving the business.

Future state for non-critical infrastructure will see a rise in the use of zero trust technology. I've already seen at least one billion dollar company leverage Illumio with most OT servers connected to the enterprise domain/networks (segmented of course). Zero trust technology basically puts a firewall (or leverages the built-in one) with a local agent install and a centralized firewall management software to make it easier. Classic firewalls general had not scalable solutions to implement rules. With today's resources and network speeds, it is possible to have each server handle this on its own.

Even without zero trust, I see DMZs less likely with OT servers part of a converged architecture connected to the business to leverage authentication (and MFA) and other capabilities. There will still be firewalls and there will still be a ""isolated"" or locked-down zone for unsecure assets/PLCs (no certs) & PCs (Win XP)","",""

Our YW zone (DMZ) had further VLAN separations between different vendor's SCADA-like systems (because the vendors usually had a high degree of access on their systems and we wanted to exclude that as an attack vector between vendors).  Ignition was usually the exception because it was the OT platform for several systems (processing, facilities, security, etc.).

Due to brown-field considerations, we had some holes in the firewall to allow SQL connections between the ERP zone and the pick-to-light systems which were in the process GRY zone, and a small number of exceptions like that; but those could easily have been resolved with a pub-sub type of setup and even better if a UNS had been constructed.

I think IT should have service and support responsibilities for the HMI, panel PCs, and other workstations in the GRY zone, as they can ensure proper licensing and gain an understanding of the issues facing OT staff (and, after all, these systems are the primary function of the business, especially when raw product is perishable*.

This can reduce licensing costs, and make sure that OS and other OT software upgrades are part of the budget planning.  It also allowed us to have a big picture view of OT systems if there was an outage (say, a power outage) and we needed to make sure everything was back up instead of waiting for 2 hours for someone to discover it was still down (because OT staff are busy getting the lines set up to check system health).  Anyway, my $0.02.

Data centers, from edge to cloud, have gotten more dense. There is a bigger emphasis on east-west traffic than in the past. There are more VMs, containers, etc running per physical interface. The physical topology of networks have become more simple and flat, but the logical topology have become more complex and further segmented by workload. The bulk of the network is happening within nodes (e.g., hypervisor switch) and the overlay between them.

Good security is less about how appliances are linked together and more about effective orchestration and policies. If you look at how spine-leaf architectures have ascended in the IT and cloud space, switching has gotten more intelligent. This has influenced enterprise and campus networking. Layers have collapsed or converged.

I don't see an issue with it. It makes it easier to further segment networks based on business requirements and security objectives. It's work that had to be done anyways that was previously, in practice, constrained by the cost of acquiring/administering a bunch of appliances. It means less compromises to keep things running in the interim while waiting for budget or lengthy change orders. Having fewer appliances and having abstracted orchestration should make things easier to manage and secure.

Factory automation is not unlike healthcare equipment, point-of-sale, transportation, defense, building automation, finance, public cloud, etc. The operational impact of system failure can be just as devastating. High-stakes networks are not unusual. The bigger issue with converged tech is with the ""people"" and ""process"". If tech is not staffed and organized to support its business objective, it's a risk. Where things go south is when OT is essentially improvised and depends on something without SLAs and shared oversight in place.","","üëç (1)"

Lots of well known attacks for VLAN hopping - on port based VLANs. Without defining further sub-zones, it'll be difficult. Am curious, how's the remote access was defined with this architecture where you may need different OEMs/Vendors/SIs needing to access and provide support for this architecture. I like the idea or concept of ""Event-Driven Architecture"", @Walker Reynolds have covered that in Gartner IT-OT Event Architecture session and in other session. I've yet to seen a real-implemented architecture. Did requested @Vaughn Turner to see if there's one. Attached is a whitepaper ISA released to discuss some scenarios where IIOT/cloud architectures were involved. Its well written along the lines of essential functions and what type of access cloud services have to local sites. Recommend a read..

Are we always at the mercy of the person who implements the firewall. A security system is not worth much if no one locks the door.

It probably does make sense to do some Port remapping. But id using Port 763 for modbus Andy safer?

For remote access, it's not really my area. Dual homing of devices is out, all access is thought the company's VPN. Connect to VPN, access dedicated resource and monitor.

There is still the access for Flowfuse and Tulip. The idea here is it is better to have one single point of access that we can apply resources to instead of many connections from edge devices.

I have 150 machines with unique ""Thing"" definitions in AWS IoT Core. With those connections, client certs and non self signed server CA cert are required.  I tested using a single set to share across the fleet, but when one device publishes to Core the devices sharing the same certs drop connection and reconnect when the first device stops publishing. I understand why AWS would impose these kinds of authentication requirements.  However, when I consider certificate management for up to 3000 devices (eventually) for local site brokers deployed using our own AWS private infrastructure to on-site servers, I become very hopeful I can do something more similar to what you have suggested.  Something like self signed server CA along with unique usernames and passwords.

At any rate, I'll be meeting with the security leads at my company to discuss this and get their perspective. The machine devices are on a dedicated VLAN and I'm hoping that there may be additional network level controls that don't constrain the everyday needs of those devices, but allow for a more relaxed security posture for on site broker connections.","",""

If you do fault mode analysis on your PKI going down having one CA is typically a no go. You'll end up with one per site, Now if your doing a rolling IIoT architecture across many sensors geographically dispersed then your stuck with Cloud mostly.  

Issue comes down to Scale, I can do like 20 self signed certs even add PLC logic to alarm when a self cert is expiring  but when you start to get to 30,40,50 you'd going to need a solution that scales with you. That means forking out the money for proper PKI. 

Seeing as I don't know what exactly your architecture is, I could recommend ADCS assuming your a classic OT Windows shop. But if your doing IIoT and want 10,000 sensors then your going to need something else. 

Still believe 802.1AR is what is going to help us in this industry, but that's my biasd opinion.  The Key to Certificates ort PKI is understanding Failure Modes , troubleshooting and rebuilding everything if the infrastructure is cooked. Once you got a handle on that its just a matter of finding the right solution that fits. Even if thats a QR 2D scanner with a automated Shell script executing openssl commands.
