What would you define as best-in-class for SCADA?

We’ve been using ignition and it is pretty great.","","👍 (3)"

Ignition is in the group and leads the pack in our opinion.  FactoryStudio is an up and comer.  WinCC-OA is in there too.  Start thinking of the SCADA layer as a series of SCADA nodes surrounding a hub and you'll understand better what I mean.","",""

@EvanWill Great question -- I suspect that we are measuring the platforms with different sticks.  What matters to @DerekStickel and what matters to me are likely quite different -- primarily because we work in different parts of the stack.  I suspect that we both agree that the solution needs to fit the problem and that there are many problems that he and I would agree on the solution.  It is important to note that Ignition is not really SCADA, rather, it is a platform for solving problems that is marketed as SCADA.  If you look at most of the solutions developed by our team with Ignition, you would be surprised to find that very few of them fall in the SCADA layer.  Ignition fits in every layer of the stack, as does FactoryStudio -- and they really are alone in that respect.  If you are just trying to solve a SCADA problem and nothing else, then I expect you could make a very compelling argument to go another direction.","","👍 (2)"

@Walker Reynolds great response! I am seeing Ignition gaining more momentum in Australia and speaking to a local SI that has used it for this first time, it sounds like it eats up pretty much anything you throw at it and at a competitive price (compared to others) to boot. @zackscriven a great interview would be @Walker Reynolds and @DerekStickel shooting the breeze on the challenges and solutions that they both post about. I have learned so much from both guys, @Walker Reynolds has certainly cemented the unified namespace concept for me and @DerekStickel is a programmer with hands on practical experience that shines through in his posts. I am also fascinated that @DerekStickel is developing MachineView in his 'free' time and if you follow Derek you know that there is not much free time to speak of.","","👍 (1)"

@Deleted User automating the normalization of this data is not really that difficult, honestly, but it has been a challenge for the industry -- the UNS is part and parcel of this normalization.

@joelp I've worked with the Zenon platform many times, both in support and leveraging on the OEM side-- especially in power applications.  I've moved away from the platform for a few reasons -- most of which have to do with the fact there are better options by companies who are more attentive and agile, that cost a lot less, with a much shorter learning curve.

@EgoNoBueno Keep in mind there is a difference between and EAM and CMMS. Fiix software has a quick blog on the difference, but fundamentally a CMMS is for keeping track of work orders, repair history, spare parts, etc. An EAM focuses on the end-to-end life of an asset. Like many technologies, the line is blurring. Where I see a real need is for capturing reliability data (vibration, infrared, ultrasound, oil analysis, etc) in a UNS. From there is could be used for condition-based maintenance which would automatically generate WOs. There are a lot of wireless sensors that now provide online monitoring which are rather inexpensive. There are many differences in technology and what they provide. I would adopt a reliability centered maintenance strategy to determine where to add these. It should be technically feasible and economically viable.","","💯 (2)"

@EgoNoBueno Infrared is commonly used for electrical enclosures, but other process equipment can benefit from its use.

@EgoNoBueno  The basics are always needed especially when you have a lot of equipment. The pity is, in the fertilizer chemistry industry, you can not open the sensors, and change the internal condensator or batteries to avoid a chemical hazard. Only companies selling the sensors are authorized to open them and the certification is costly. This implies high maintenance costs.

So I want the flexibility to evaluate expressions, as simple as an and logic. Let's say I want to create an and logic having two digital tags as inputs. As they come by exception, when I do c = a and b, what I mean is that c = last known value for a AND last known value for b. They did not arrive at the same time. I've done this with database using simple operations like one operator and two inputs as formula, entering ids as inputs. I wanted something more sofisticated like expressions in a SCADA. SCADA is statefull so the inputs are tags on the server RAM. Going to the database, I'm not really handling a table of current values for each tag but a table with key, value and timestamp. Expressions are not as simple as they require a compiler to provide tag browsing and intellisense. I also wanted it to be stateless backed by a database, so this ""real time expressions provider"" could run on 1 or N instances at the same time, getting the current values from a 3rd server, a DB server that can be a single instance or a cluster. In short, things that are simple to do in a plc or SCADA can be done with views on a database, but that is not scalable as it takes much longer to write each specific view than writing an expression on a PLC. I'm just venting actually but my thought is if something can be done with a database that handles only real time or last known value as the plc database and SCADA tags database are, there should be a pattern to replicate this behavior on a SQL table.

In many cases (not all) IT have been the CAVEmen - against everything. IT will not provide infrastructure nor engage with OT to find a mutually agreeable solution or their solution is so limited in scope and accessibility that nobody uses it; dooming the initiative to failure. In cases such as this, we offer a cellular connection to the cloud where we have Ignition or some other app running. The purpose of this end run is to provide OT with a positive experience that then forces IT to come back to the table.

Knowing that your solution must be deployable in the cloud and on-prem take time some time in the beginning to do your research. For example, if you want to work with a great cloud solution provider and you spend a lot of time ($$$$) developing a slick application, what will you do when the customer says ""that application is great and solves our pain points!. I now need it running in our site!"" What are you going to do? How much more $$$$ will you need to charge the customer? How will your customer feel about the charges for additional work?

1. The answer is sort of -- you can create components, but it is best to use the Ignition sdk to this as you will want to expose all of the event handlers and api methods with your component.
2. You can use an iframe, yes, but the component object will be the browser or iframe component and not your chart (so events on the chart are not exposed to the rest of the environment).","","💯 (2)"

Cloud vs On-Prem can, even still today, be a contentious subject.  Some of its practical (e.g., latency) and some of it is impractical (e.g., intimidated ""cave men"").  I'm fortunate enough to be an environment that is infrastructure-agnostic.  It helps when your org has relied on SaaS ERP/MES for nearly 15 years.

The simple answer to the question of infrastructure is, of course, ""it depends..."".  I was curious about diving into the technical specifics.  I was curious about the different scenarios and seeing how each of us approach them differently.  We are fortunately to be living in a time where technology does not necessarily narrow our options as it has in the past.

Sometimes these decisions are governed by investment cycles and where already available infrastructure resides.  I wanted to go beyond this and think about optimal design.

I have attached a mock-up of two very different approaches.  Perhaps this might be useful to ""riff"" off of.

I'm curious if any of you have a go-to solution that you continually come back to in your projects.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336204242747503/771061206902767686/IIoT_Infrastructures.pdf?ex=68df5d75&is=68de0bf5&hm=b990d4f2abb007f604087d32cea469d3164540118aca73d36322132bc6d9b223&","👍 (1)"

Switching to report by exception changes that and reduces data.  Second, the UNS isn’t all realtime and historical data in one place — it is the structure of your data in a namespace, it is the last value of the data stored, it is a list of all clients that are subscribing to specific parts of the data and it is the events of the data — as a value changes or a state changes, the UNS fires that event and notifies the client.

I have not looked into using Discord in the enterprise.  From an end-user perspective, it's impressive.  Slack, MS Teams, and Webex Teams are the usual suspects in the corporate world.  These have robust tools for managing compliance and large/complex user base.  They are also used with other things.  As bad as it sounds, they're more likely to be IT-sanctioned.  Regardless of the tool, the idea is plugging in collaboration tools into the digital factory is brilliant.

We currently use workflows/integrations in Slack for the more ""human"" events in the factory that the automation space can't necessarily model well (not well currently, at least).  We have a Slack channel for each cell.  These have a set of workflows to request assistance.  They also receive notifications from MES and QMS (e.g., dimension out-of-spec, deviation).  They've worked well for triaging with offsite support.  It's also an easier way to communicate in a noisy environment (especially with smart watches).  There is a ton of potential for integration with SCADA.

Ignition's Slack Alarm Notification SDK

ServiceNow, an IT service management platform, is a tool I've wondered about.  It's exceptional at managing complex IT environments.  The automation is slick.

That is, they have created a new vertical line of products that do support or will support many of the technologies that are report by exception, edge driven and open architecture.  That being said, very rarely do we recommend that a client stick with their current WW architecture -- its not that we never make that recommendation, but we rarely do.

You can modify this using their Azure Network Firewall, Security groups, OS firewalls, or lastly 3rd party network appliances (think next gen firewall / paloalto etc..). If I were doing it and the requirement is PRIVATE. I would create a virtual network, setup a Point to Site VPN and add the vpn client to my edge node. Then install the ignition infrastructure on VMs as normal using security groups to allow connectivity to the Database of choice (i'd use a manged DB) then I'd probably also use a network firewall and kill all outbound internet traffic so only VPN traffic was allowed.","",""

Inductive Automation is a Technology partner - meaning their software has been tested against a baseline:

Also, the product has been physically installed and tested on a production or LAB Outpost and the baselines are passed on the Outpost as well. 

Both Ignition and OSI Pi have this certification in the industrial space - 57 other software platforms are certified and growing.

The Outpost is fully managed and supported by AWS. So that means our teams or possibly a Consulting Service partner will show up and install it. The new versions are 1U or 2U in size - they are self-install and require no on-site visits.","",""

Retrieving data for purposes other than SCADA would require additional software and engineering time to make this functionality work (we wanted to move operational data to a CMMS system for preventive maintenance tasks).  If we could have used any SQL database, everything we needed to do would only require writing some SQL queries.  2)This utility is constantly growing and the need to expand the system would require additional costs in licensing (additional tags, additional historical tags, additional clients, etc.).  3) Redundancy, Ignition only requires a few settings to implement redundancy.  If I remember correctly, IFix tag databases had to be moved or copied to redundant servers. (This may have changed since then)  4)Data types and structures Ignition offered more options in this area at that time. 5) Support, GE/IFix support was a multi tiered offering that required a phone call to the distribution channel, then if necessary the distributor would contact GE/IFix.

1. It isn't edge driven without adopting part 14 pub/sub (which recommends MQTT for the transport layer)
2. It isn't truly report by exception in most cases
3. It isn't lightweight -- it is a very verbose standard
4. The standard tries to be everything to everyone -- as such, the standard is 75% optional so we see far too much deviation between vendors who adopt it 
5. It was developed at a time when serial networks were king, Purdue security was the standard and server/client, poll/response was the architecture

I see a lot of potential with Part 14 pub/sub, assuming the OPC Foundation can fix the underlying issues with the standard itself (point 2,3,4) AND someone can develop a super lightweight implementation to run on even the most under-provisioned hardware (see all entry level PLCs and HMIs).  

Considering MQTT Sparkplug B is out there competing against OPC-UA, I just don't see a reason to put OPC in the middle of the architecture.

OPC Foundation is going to need to fix this using part 14 of the standard -- by stripping out the bloat and verbosity for pub/sub implementations because it is far too late for OPC-UA proper in poll/response implementations.

They're a bolted-on communication module that functions as if it were a third-party product.  They can't always ""shoehorn"" native memory structures into rigid tag-oriented namespaces.  IMO, this can be attributed to technical limitations and a lack of imagination.

I believe it comes from an old-school HMI mindset:  create a logic subroutine for the visualization, expose the tags to the communication interface, and build the context in the HMI program.  Everything is hardcoded and modified on as-needed basis.  Nothing is architected in a way that would dynamically publish or consume data.  From a product management perspective, some believe that publishing a raw tag one-by-one without context is viable.

The other culprit, I suspect, could be performance constraints of the hardware.  Some embedded interfaces are from third-party commercial SDKs that were added after the fact and/or not necessarily optimized for the platform.  It allows them to go-to-market with support for a standard with minimal investment.  The unfortunate result of this might yield tag count limitations, inconsistent handling of datatypes, or awkward management interfaces.

Have you considered leveraging the Bosch Rexroth PLC's native protocol?  Can it expose symbolic addressing over something like CODESYS or SERCOS III?  It's not unheard of for third-party OPC Servers to have have superior support to native ones.  It might also be worthwhile looking into if there is a native SDK available.  Those IndraMotion units are basically PCs and have pretty elaborate front ends.  I wouldn't be surprised if they had a .NET library or Windows driver available.

Another option is to do nothing and consume as-is.  Some machines and controls were architected as silos.  It can be cost-prohibitive making certain assets natively ""edge-driven"".  Instead, one must create their own edge elsewhere and perform transformations there.","","👏 (1),🙌 (1)"

The web service implementation supports XML (or even binary) encoding over SOAP.  This version is exotic and has been basically deprecated.  Because it requires each node to parse XML and support HTTP, it's less performant than its TCP binary counterpart.

Very few products, especially devices, have implemented the web service spec.  I believe the thinking was that this spec was apt for exchanging data among higher level systems.  When the UA spec was wrote ~15 years ago, SOAP was the premier technology for integration in enterprise IT.  Microsoft conceived the technology and it was pushed in reference architectures.  This, theoretically, provided UA with interoperability among software applications.  Although, this never really took off.

OPC-UA, regardless of encoding or transport, is verbose because of the standard.  It has a very ""rich"" object model that is seldom utilized.  It's one of most complicated ways to exchange what is, in practice, little more than name and value pairs.

To use an analogy, suppose one ordered ten books from Amazon.  Normally, Amazon would fulfill the order with packaging to protect the contents and optimize cost.  But, this time, Amazon packaged the books inside of a library.  They shipped a whole library.  And it's not just any library.  It's a national or top research university library.  It has immaculate facilities, unlimited book shelves, archival capabilities, the best technology, the best faculty, all organized, etc.  It has everything one would need to learn or research anything.  But, it only contains the ten books that were ordered.  With a ""glass half empty"" mindset, one might say this is overkill.  With a ""glass half full"" mindset, one might be pleasantly surprised by the library and all it can enable.  But, eventually, one becomes disappointed it can only be used as a book shelf.  This is what it feels like to use OPC-UA.","","👍 (1)"

I’ve been reading discord back and forth and I truly love the idea of a single source of truth. 
The question that remains stuck in my head is when to use which communication protocol.

MQTT, OPC UA, S7 connection. 

PLC -SCADA com. for process control. the PLC is capable to publish to the MQTT broker, has  an onboard OPC UA server and obviously can use S7 com.

Thanks for your input 👍
I agree, we shouldn’t send process control over the cloud with whatever protocol. 
Let’s assume we use ignition as local SCADA and also give it a role as local broker, or as a local OPC UA server. What’s the difference? We still send process control from the ignition SCADA to the PLC. Why would one choose OPC over MQTT in this case? 
Isn’t the sparkplug spec intended to be used in “real time” applications?

If this statement is correct then MQTT can be used for process control, with the right type of PLC there is no more need for point to point connections.

Most applications can achieve probabilistic determinism with even the least performant standard.  There are, of course, niche applications that will require specific solutions.  What fieldbus one deploys is more of a function of hardware platform they deploy.  One does not get the freedom of mixing and matching.  Unfortunately, many of these companies govern these standards as somewhat of a walled garden for their own ecosystem.

EtherCAT = Beckhoff
SECROS-III = Bosch-Rexroth
EtherNet/IP = Rockwell
PROFINET = Siemens
Powerlink = B&R

EtherCAT is really cool technology.  But, as mentioned earlier, it's late to the game.  And a lot of applications don't necessarily benefit from it.  It's like hot rodding a minivan or heavy duty truck.  It either can't make use of the additional power or it doesn't help it fulfill its purpose any better.  It's a classic ""weird flex, but okay"" scenario.

EtherNet/IP is unique in that it leverages the standard Ethernet stack unmodified.  There are pros and cons to this.  The greatest pro is that it doesn't require an ASIC.  Whatever the IT or consumer tech world use, so can EtherNet/IP.  This makes it easy to implement and adopt.  This is why some vendors (e.g., Schneider, Omron) have preferential support for EtherNet/IP along with other protocols.  Combined with other technologies (e.g., PTP, TSN, 1000BASE, 10GBASE, TLS, DTLS), EtherNet/IP can handle a lot of complex applications.  It's not the fastest or most elegant technology, but it's the most poised for adoption and growth.","","💯 (1),👏 (1)"

It's very common for shipping & receiving documentation (e.g., bill of lading, commercial invoice, customs).  When it comes time to implement a shipping operation at a site, Topaz signature device is one of the first things deployed.  It quickly eliminates unnecessary scanning and administrative overhead.  Beyond that, the occasional quality application comes up (e.g., certificates).  Unfortunately, I have not encountered this for SCADA.

As for your question regarding Ignition, I wonder if you could leverage that reporting module?  Is there some sort of method exposed in the scripting to consume an image and ""stamp"" it in a form?  A lot of signature capture devices can be exposed as a TWAIN device.  Unfortunately, I was not able any sort of TWAIN interface for Ignition.  You're probably stuck leveraging an SDK for a signature device or image capture.  Topaz has all sorts of options.

Recommended SDKs:
-Dynamsoft Web TWAIN (HTML5 interface for image capture / scanning)
-Topaz SigPlusExtLite (browser extension interface for topaz)
-Topaz SigPlus Pro Java  (java interface for topaz)

Another option is to look into DocuSign.  They have tons of integrations and strong APIs.  It's also great if you need a closed-loop with legal or formally control the documents being signed.  You could have your loadout station workflow fire off a DocuSign envelope and then wait for the signature to be executed.

UPDATE
Whoa.  Just stumbled upon this.  You're in luck.  There is now signature capture functionality directly within the Perspective module.  You could avoid the signature capture device all together and, instead, leverage a touchscreen or tablet.

If we leave the UNS ""open"" for writes in addition to reads, could we get into an issue where someone unknowingly creates an unsafe condition or makes a button to turn off someone else's machine when they're not looking? For these reasons, we might want to make the UNS read-only for some user groups. However, that isn't enabling innovation at the plant floor as much as allowing writes would. Perhaps we can make PLC/Edge tags read only for some user groups but allow them to push new tags in if they choose?

As far as structure, since the UNS is edge driven, it would be difficult for an unknowing person to ""mess it up"" but they could pollute it by pushing data to namespaces where it doesn't belong. Anyone who's used a shared network drive knows how messy it can get. I think this is best solved with education vs lock-down. Maybe after an employee has gone through their initial training and become familiar with interacting with the UNS through their dashboards, they attend an in-house workshop on how we build simple dashboards and organize data. After that, they get access to creating their own dashboards?

Just my thoughts. I'm curious how people further along their 4.0 journey are handling this.","",""

That way we can learn new ways and needs to improve the SCADA-system further. Implementation of the outcome of this and other views / functions will be done by trained personnel.

If you rely on pulling all data into ONE system, you'll have to do everything in this application. One of the benefits of a UNS is that the state of every application in the business is available to any application that wants to make use of this data to create new data or information. This will enable innovation on a level that can't be achieved by relying on ONE application to do everything. Back in the 3.0 days, developing the functionality that involved more than one system, would require such an effort, that it was limited to high value targets. With a UNS, the effort required to develop this type of functionality will require a lot less effort, and therefore have a increasing likelyhood of being cost effective, and thus implemented. With everything in a SCADA, the functions you could develop would be limited by what tools are available in the SCADA system.

Ignition's AB drivers are Ethernet-based.  In the SLC series, only the 5/05 processor has a native Ethernet support.  The 5/04 does not.  There are three options:

1)  Add a hardware Ethernet gateway to the SLC 5/04 (e.g., NET-ENI, ENTB, RTA 1761-NET-ENI Replacement).  This will convert the processor's native serial protocol (DH-485, DH+) to Ethernet.

2)  Replace the SLC 5/04 processor with a 5/05 processor.  This will provide native Ethernet connectivity

3)  If you have an existing infrastructure that communicates with one of the legacy AB serial protocols (e.g., DH-485, DH+, DF), you could leverage a software gateway.  If it's feeding into an RSLinx or ControlLogix somewhere, you could tap into these by deploying an OPC server such as Kepware.

In an ideal world, I would advocate for an overhaul replacing the SLC with a CompactLogix 5380 or the popular options in this community (e.g., PLCNext, Groov EPIC, S7-1200/1500).  Those SLCs are end-of-life, parts becoming more expensive, and it will become a greater technical limitation in digital transformation down the road.  This is the most costly option.  

Next best option, in my opinion, would be to replace the processor with a 5/05.  This requires a simple program transfer and re-config.  This will provide native ethernet connectivity to the memory table.  It bypasses any serial protocols and eliminates the need to deploy a gateway in the field.

If you insist on keeping the 5/04, add an Ethernet interface.  I believe Rockwell has discontinued these.  Real Time Automation offers a great replacement.

Lastly, whether you opt for the 5/05 natively or a 5/04 with a gateway, I would recommend using the Kepware's AB Ethernet driver instead of Ignition's.  Kepware can expose the data to Ignition via OPC-UA or MQTT.","","👍 (2)"

I need scada connected to the PLCs for troubleshooting / status display, and would like to add in detailed realtime downtime reporting. Hoping to set up a UNS and run MQTT messaging. Looking at Ignition at this stage, and have the obvious noob question of Vision or Perspective? Being able to embed Perspective sessions in our existing tablet interface for our mobile robots would be nice, so kinda leaning that way. Any strong opinions on this?

Also dashboards / reports is where I want to push for my I4.0 aspirations, and I have seen some sexy looking tatsoft dashboards in the background in some of Walker's videos. Ignition is our corporate standard in the U.S. but I have some discretion here in NZ. Should I push on with Ignition, or pause and check out Tatsoft's offerings. Will they get me what I need in terms of scada as well as reporting / dashboards?

The advantage of Vision is ease of development, lots of support available in the community, short learning curve.  The advantage of Perspective is native mobile and fully reactive screens.

The way I interpreted this statement implied that SCADA systems, depending on their performance, can be either safe or unsafe.  If I misinterpreted this, please let me know.

SCADA, as the name implies, is a supervisory control function.  It's not intended for controlling anything related to safety.  It's like an HMI, but for a larger scope (e.g., Area, Plant, Enterprise).  Theoretically, one could place an E-Stop button on an HMI screen, but they don't because HMIs are not a safety-rated device.  The performance of a SCADA should have not bearing on its safe operation because it's not intended as such.  The role of critical control and safety are for PLCs and DCSs.

If anyone else would like to chime in on this, please do so.  I'm not as well-versed in the process industries and DCS.  I predominantly focus on discrete manufacturing.  The way I think about this is that a PLC controls a process whereas a SCADA supervises the control of a process.","",""

Also, another method might be to bypass the SCADA systems altogether and just dump the raw data into a lake for use at a later time.  The PLC is going to be dedicated to the running of the actual machine, and the SCADA system is probably fairly structured, and monitoring a limited number of parameters.  An edge-type infrastructure, where you are sending everything to a central repository (local, cloud, etc.) via an edge connection is probably the best solution in this case.  Let the PLC and SCADA system operate as they are, and pull data from the machines through an edge connection for more in-depth/advanced analytics.  Lets the system run as designed, and still provides the more data intensive capabilities.  Walker did a good video on what that infrastructure would look like.","",""

The filtering of on-demand requests sounds like a good federating function. Matrikon Data Broker looks to do the same with OPC-UA client/server connections: if there is one server and 100 clients with the same subscription needs (same tags only every 1000ms, for example), the one server would only see a single subscription from the federating application. It helps take the burden off the device to scale across the Enterprise.

Older models will only have an S7 interface.  Newer models will have S7 and OPC-UA Server interfaces.  Newer models, with the right firmware, will have these and even an MQTT client interface.

Ignition SCADA is very popular in this community  If you don't like your old WinCC, you might like WinCC-OA.  Both of these solutions have interfaces for S7, OPC-UA, and MQTT.

As far as MQTT brokers, HiveMQ and EMQ are popular solutions.  Ignition offers an MQTT broker as a module.  It can be used with or without other Ignition SCADA modules.

Depending on your architecture and needs, you might find additional tools like KEPServerEX and HighByte helpful.  KEPServerEX can convert native protocols like S7 to OPC-UA or MQTT.  HighByte can help as a dedicated tool for modeling data going in and out of the MQTT broker.","",""

I have been running what was originally a PoC for two years now as a simple SCADA system based on Node-RED, and it has worked very well.
The disadvantages are that it does not have user management for dashboards, nor dashboards that are easy to build for an industrial application (flow, pipes etc).

We're migrating to Ignition and Perspective these days, but I will not hesitate to use Node-RED for some tasks on the edge o.l.

This will convert to native datetime based on the number of seconds that have eclipsed since the arbitrary 1970 base date.  The syntax will vary based on your underlying database.  Check out SQL epoch time conversion tutorials for more details.  Here's an example below:
```DATEADD(S, t_stamp, '1970-01-01')```
This probably could also be accomplished through an expression or binding a property, but it's probably more efficient to leave heavy lifting to the database.

Anyways, in this case, it's more a function of Ignition bastardizing a relational database as a historian.  With a time series database, it would be a different story.  Because of the multiple columns, I thought @justinb0044 was merely making some sort of transactional report.  Usability was the basis of recommending the native datetime format.

I'm glad microsecond and nanosecond were brought up.  What I posted was not scaled.  Check out these support documents:
https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047136252-Understanding-Tag-Historian-Timestamps
https://forum.inductiveautomation.com/t/fast-data-trending-with-millisecond-resolution/10724/5

The integer vs datetime discussion is interesting.  Relational database technology has evolved a lot in the past 10 years.  I wonder how much of it makes a difference in Ignition in the case.  It's sort of a moot point as most would conclude that it's preferable to leverage a proper time series database.

All things equal, integer is lighter weight and theoretically more performant.  But, with other factors (e.g., localization, daylights savings time, parameters, analytics) at play, normalizing to the database's native methodology for handling datetime typically pays off.  In contemporary databases, there often isn't a difference in performance.  There is a lot of clever tech under the hood for this.  And in some cases, with the all the features to support analytical workloads, datetime is actually more performant.  The real deciding factor comes down to usability.

You're right about the inconsistent handling.  It's honestly a problem everywhere.  I would argue it's even worse in the ERP world than industrial data transfer world.  If only we could all just embrace ISO 8601.","","👍 (1)"

""Cache Your Check and Share with Your Friends
In Ignition 8.1.12, several Perspective bindings receive a new setting called “Shared and Cache.” This new feature consolidates multiple identical polling tasks that optimize data queries. When the setting is enabled, the query uses a polling engine that is shared across all running Perspective sessions. The polling engine will run the query once, cache the value, and deliver results to all registered users.

The new feature allows certain binding types to cache data from a source, such as a database query, and allow other session instances to use the same cached data. So instead of having each HMI session query data, multiple running sessions can share data from one database query.

The new settings are added to Tag History Bindings, Named Query Bindings, and HTTP Bindings as simple checkboxes. In addition, the Alarm Status Table component and the Alarm Journal Table component implement this functionality natively.""

* ~ 2000 facilities
* ~ 100 devices / facility
* ~ 100 signals / device (slow data. Like 1min poll rate)
* TOTAL = ~ 10M tags
* Each facility must have a small SCADA / HMI to monitor and control its devices (connected via Modbus). It is not necessary to have synoptics. It is only necessary to have alarms and notifications. Some alarms are managed by the SCADA, so it is necessary to be able to define the alarm logic (check conditions, timers, etc).
* Also, it's required to have a central SCADA to monitor all stores and orchestrate local scada changes. Information will be exchanged with local SCADAs through an MQTT broker.
* Each facility must be independent of the central scada. So if communication is lost, the local SCADA must continue to operate and store data (buffering).

I am looking at a WinCC OA based solution but the licenses are very (VERY) expensive. I am also considering Igntion but perhaps I have the same problem since I have seen that the licensing is per server and here we would have about 2000, right?

Another approach you could take is to work with sales teams to appropriately price their solution for your application.  There is no perfect pricing model.  Everyone derives value differently and there will be outliers.  Moving beyond merely plugging numbers into a CPQ engine could really pay off.  For example, a smaller site with advanced automation can have more tags than massive enterprise with many sites with basic automation.  In the end, pricing is about discriminating between firms who can afford to pay more and those who cannot.

Do you have a json payload? If so, Ignition can't handle multilevel/nested json arrays, så it has to be Objects.

I'm envisioning a machine integrator not asking what its IP Address should be, but instead asking where it should publish its data. It will be a while until we get there...

Ideally, the machine's data would already implement the model for that machine as defined by the end-user. So it can publish its data within a ""machine object"" framework or template.

Within the UNS, other, higher-level applications can be notified on new machine objects being added, and perform aggregating functions such as adding up the part counts from all the machines. Since the aggregating function knows what part of the business it is interested in, and that it is only concerned with machines, it can filter against only machine objects within that location.

If the data being published is just a sensor value, for example, then templates don't make sense.","",""

Interesting to see you and Jon disagree on this, not surprised at all.  There are definitely some cases where symmetry between the ""device"" and its digital representation at the app level are common - more in ""classic"" IoT use cases where you have a fleet of identical or nearly identical machines/devices/assets.

So having the software define the model where updates to that software at the same time improves the model, then the consuming application simply receives those updates and inherently understands the additional data.  For the user that owns both sides, this is most efficient.

For systems that aren't so strongly typed, or disparate, or brownfield, then a middleman is required, where any change in data on the floor drives an update in at least three locations: (1) device makes a new datapoint available, (2) dataops incorporates this within the larger model, (3) application is modified/created to utilize the data.

I think that explains the disagreement. 😆","","🍻 (1)"

I was just thinking about this the other day.  I wondered if greenfield nodes could ever hit the broker natively.  Increasingly, I don't know if dataops could ever be bypassed.  I generally work with fairly new automation, but almost nothing meets the 'minimum technical requirements'.  It's lower cost and practical to retrofit/integrate internally than it is to firmly demand it as a requirement in my industry.  It's easier to specify ""create this UDT for a fieldbus node to produce and consume tags to"" as a foundation to build on than try to do anything more.  Due to launch complexities (e.g., capital constraints, slow customer authorizations, engineering changes), machines are barely ready when they're received.

Directly refers to a SCADA having a driver for a PLC's native protocol.  Tatsoft and Wonderware have among the largest driver suites.  Most other SCADA products will focus on having drivers that support the PLCs with the largest market share (e.g., Siemens, AB, Mitsubishi, Modbus, Omron).  Indirectly refers to the SCADA connecting up to a third-party solution such as an OPC Server or gateway.  In conclusion, sometimes the SCADA connect to the PLC natively (e.g., S7, EtherNet/IP) and sometimes they connect to a gateway over a normalized IIoT protocol (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA).

Here are some some architectures that will satisfy connectivity to most PLCs without IIoT protocol support..

[SCADA] [Native Driver] <- native protocol -> [PLC]

[SCADA][OPC-UA Client] <- OPC-UA -> [OPC-UA Server][Native Driver] <- native protocol -> [PLC]

[SCADA][MQTT Client] <- MQTT -> [Broker] <- MQTT -> [MQTT Client][Gateway][Native Driver] <- native protocol -> [PLC]

[SCADA][MQTT Client] <- MQTT -> [Broker] <- MQTT -> [MQTT Client][Gateway][OPC-UA Client] <- OPC-UA -> [OPC-UA Server][Native Driver] <- native protocol -> [PLC]

This is sometimes marketed as CIP Sync or CIP Motion on the Stratix products.  Unfortunately, they offer products with different firmware versions with and without this.  This technology enables determinism and motion control for EtherNet/IP.

If I recall, for anything with motion instructions (e.g., PF527, Kinetix), it's advised to have managed switch with PTP or connect directly to the processor.  Also, check that the ports have the appropriate QoS tags assigned.  Outside of the IOS CLI, the GUI has something some sort of device type for each port that (I believe) should do this.  While different CIP class traffic has a default priority order, it becomes ambigueous with enough nodes and when nothing is defined.  This tends gets overlooked because it's not really a thing with other fieldbuses and, with EtherNet/IP, it's not a problem until it's a problem.

Some models with some firmware are so buggy that they overwork the processor and have tendancy to look up.  The only way to recover them is flash with a new image over TFTP.

The economics aren't very good either.  It costs a fortune to add layer 3, full-featured firmware, PoE, and additional ports.  I get that it's a rugged unit with redundant power supplies, but it's older technology and the numbers don't add up.  Some of the higher-end Stratix models cost a significant fraction of what some Catalyst models do.  Think advanced access or even distribution workloads (e.g., 24/48 ports, 10G uplinks, stacking, PoE, integrated wireless control, orchestration, security).

I do love the idea of the product.  Having an ""OT"" interface (e.g., Browser GUI, Studio 5000) on an IOS/XE switch is smart.  It's machine builder friendly while being very interoperable with everything else on most end-user networks.  The software is just so bloated that it's not worth it in many cases.","",""

In the technical sense, an OPC server is simply an application that can receive connection requests from OPC Clients to exchange data. A Windows application that is simply a random number generator could contain an OPC Server.

I've also heard the term OPC Server to refer to applications like Kepware or Matrikon that have a swiss-army knife of drivers to connect to southbound devices and serve up am OPC server. Then after more advanced, they added other communication protocols, but the ""OPC Server"" name stuck. Today, I would refer to these as Data Aggregators, Data Federators, or Data Gateways

@Walker Reynolds referred to OPC servers not being report-by-exception because of the inefficiencies of the device drivers having to poll in blocks of data at a time, instead of getting each register separately.

It confused me for a while until I finally understood what he meant by OPC server 😆","","👍 (1)"

Another possibility if we don't want/trust to the DC's to do the MQTT conversion, then have the DC's write to a local SQL DB, then do a HighByte to MQTT ??

Final idea if we want to introduce new hardware / start phasing out the old DC's, maybe we can get rugged industrial style PC's running Ignition Edge that run along side the existing DCs. Then we can keep the old stuff running and slowly transistion over to the Ignition world...

It's ""store-and-forward"" functionality acts as buffer in the event that ODBC connection to the SQL database goes down.  In other words, KEPServerEx DataLogger is a SQL client with a buffer.  The buffer queues up INSERT statements and writes them to disk until the database becomes accessible again.

Similarly, Ignition has its own SQL-based tag historian as well as the SQL bridge for transaction groups.  Both of these have ""store-and-forward"" capability to buffer the transactions in the event that the database is unavailable.  Like, KEPServerEx, Ignition is a SQL client with a buffer.

The above scenarios primarily relate to error-handling of SQL connections.  They do not address the resiliency of general tag or data access.  

In most architectures, Ignition sees KEPServerEx as a OPC-UA Server.  OPC-UA connections have quality and other meta data that can indicate when there is an issue with a connection.  Kepware with the IoT Gateway has some buffering with MQTT interface and more sophisticated store-and-forward with the AlwaysOn protocol interface for ThingWorx.

It would be helpful to know more about your architecture and where you're concerned about having store-and-forward.  For example, are you trying to have remote assets or plants interface with a central Ignition gateway across a WAN that may be subject to connection issues?

Here are a few different scenarios of working with native protocols and various software gateways.  Typically, one would setup MQTT client to reside at the edge of the network before connections can degrade.

[PLC] <- native protocol -> [KEPServerEx] <- OPC-UA -> [Ignition/Edge] <- MQTT -> [MQTT Broker]
[PLC] <- native protocol -> [KEPServerEx with IoT Gateway] <- MQTT -> [MQTT Broker]
[PLC] <- native protocol -> [Ignition/Edge] <- MQTT -> [MQTT Broker]

Dashboard was constructed modularly  and encapsulated web components because of Angular (1) framework

1) Grafana charts can be configured to be embedded. They Iframe into a Node Red a dash nicely - not super dynamic or flexiable once created but functional

2) Custom CSS. Any dashboard node has CSS Classes, and arbitrary CSS can be dynamically applied with templates and with a little bit of workmanship can be really slick visually.   I think this is a really good thing to pursue. 

3) UI Builder. Implements ANY framework or no framework at all. and just executes the front end with a solid structure and template method to pass JS variables to the front end and messages back into the back end from events on the front end","","👍 (1)"

If you're looking to simulate connections and tags in a typical implementation (i.e., TCP Binary Data Access), you could use Kepware.  To simulate a server, you could leverage the simulation drivers (e.g., fixed values, ramp) for the tags.  Client side, it could connect to another server.

If your use cases is more on debugging/analyzing a connection, look into Unified Automation's products.  UaExpert is a ""go-to"" client for testing.

Does anyone have a suggestion on downtime entry platform in cases where additional operator input is required? I would like status to be automatic as much as possible, however we have some cases (e.g. stop button pressed) where we want the operator to select from a list of groups and reasons in that group. I feel like this could be at the MES level but we aren’t there yet. We had a proposal to modify the HMI and control system for this. However, this isn’t my first choice because I’d rather try and identify a more “generic” solution. We have a lot of different PLCs and related software. While there are other features I’d like, some key ones right now are:
1)    Ability to prevent a machine from starting if no downtime reason was entered. This is where I think control system integration will be required on some level but again would like to go as “generic” as possible. For this, I thought about possibly writing a program and having all our control systems written so that the declaration entry system could activate a PLC input to inhibit running. Even better might be some small piece of hardware we could add like a relay to prevent running so that we don’t have to make any changes. 
2)     Be able to handle the entered reason retroactively. For example, machine state goes to stopped/not producing at 8:00, reason entered at 8:05, machine starts producing at 8:07, would like all 7 minutes of that single stop instance to be associated with the reason they entered.","",""

Particularly during.  I would also challenge you to question the value of collecting the granular downtime data forever.  Have a process or manufacturing engineer spend a few days in the plant and talk to the operators, watch the machines, etc...you'll get a good sense of what is causing issues from that.

I've probably done 100+ downtime capture systems over the years . What was funny was how, particularly with long lists of downtime codes, the operator usually picked the top one or one near the top of the list.  When we noticed that, we decided to randomize the order of the list.  Lo and behold, downtime reasons started to become uniformly distributed across all the options in the list.  Point being that the information may not be as accurate as you'd think or of much value versus actually spending time on the plant floor and talking to the people who deal with the downtime issues on a daily basis.","","💯 (1)"

I'm aware that Ignition is very popular in the community, but I'm looking for cheaper alternatives that are just as good? The number of tags used in my factory does not exceed 1000 tags.

Systems I want to monitor and log run time data:
- Industrial ovens (39 units)
- Production lines (mostly just conveyors)
- Cold storage
- Boilers
- Small wastewater treatment system

(Q2) Siemens WinCC Unified SCADA licenses appear to be cheaper for my use case, but what are its shortcomings compared to Ignition? WinCC doesn't seem to be talked about much.

The sales mentioned that these licenses would need to be purchased for WinCC Unified SCADA (not sure if it's missing any that I'm not aware of)

- Engineering
- Runtime
- Client (Operate)
- Client (Monitor)
- Database Storage

(Q3) How does WinCC Unified SCADA compare with the Ignition Unlimited Package: Basic? It seems like the Ignition Pro package is quite necessary for SQL bridge, Reporting, and Alarm modules, which increases the price tag by a lot. Does WinCC licenses have these ""Pro"" features by default?

Any input is appreciated","",""

A lot of Fanuc-based CNCs I've worked with have their own custom alarm implementation.  In many cases, they reside in the ""C Language Executor"" runtime.  These memory objects aren't always exposed over FOCAS.  They have to be written to registers accessible to Ladder engine to be picked up.

2) The implementation of OPC UA was so clunky and had myriad limitations.

I think OPC UA subscriptions is an underrated tool.  It can be beneficial to govern data acquisition centrally rather than on many nodes.  I find that a lot of people aren't familiar with subscriptions and never implement it.  I think, in practice, it can satisfy the ""report-by-exception"" objective for data acquisition better than MQTT in some cases.  I've seen a lot of real world implementations of MQTT with large, monolithic payloads.  Many publishing nodes lack the sophistication to easily break up the payload or even publish on change.  One does not enjoy the benefits of pub/sub if all data is always moved.  This is not really a function of the protocols themselves, but rather how they're implemented on devices.

I suppose it depends on what the application is.  If one needs to move a lot of data, a bolted on OPC UA Server with tag count limitations may be a problem.  If one needs to move data infrequently or on an event-driven basis, OPC UA Subscriptions or well-implemented MQTT Client can work well.  If one needs fast reads, polling over the native protocol can work well.  There are all sorts of optimizations that can be done with respect to the native protocol and the scanning sequence of memory objects in the device.  

I think it's much more nuanced problem than we realize.","",""

This is evidenced by looking back at the precursor to Ignition FactorySQL, it's only job was to use an opc server to connect PLCs to SQL databases. Factory PMI came and added a GUI and scripting. And that all got merged into what we now know as Ignition.

My typical use case is native drivers where applicable, and edge gateway appliances to bridge incompatible devices. 

That said, this conversation does change depending on how Ignition is used. HMI, SCADA, or MES.

I'm wondering what use cases you have that the native modules failed in?

Also, when you say, ""keep iterating on Ignition"" what do you mean by ""Ignition""?

While it's nice to consolidate solutions and see more connectivity options in the marketplace, I feel like this is not really the core problem most should be focusing on.  There have existed solutions to solve this problem for decades.  The real challenge has been making whats sent over that protocol useful than the protocol itself.  In my experience, many data acquisition and protocol normalization problems can be solved in minutes or hours with commercial-off-the-shelf solutions.  Putting the data in those payloads to use can take days, weeks, months, etc.  The more that can solve the latter problem, the better off manufacturers will be.

The one area where I can concede native is truly a massive problem is when a protocol is not browsable and the memory objects have primitive addresses (e.g., B10:0/11, R1000.1, M251).  It's non-trivial working through this a protocol gateway or an application with native drivers.  I would like to start seeing some of online repositories or machine builders provide a ""data catalog"" defining the native memory objects in a way that can be dropped into platforms.  There are too many assets with missing documentation and no comments in the source code.  The industry needs to start publicly pressuring machine builders that don't do this.  And if the standards bodies really wanted to make an impact, they would publicly host repositories for this stuff and allow the market to see who is really delivering on the goal of interoperability.","","👍 (1)"

We have a mixture of both the older (C-Series) and newer (N-Series) Omron PLCs, and had Ignition on 1 dedicated server and KepServer on another dedicated server, both in our virtual environment.  Kepware's setup and performance on the newer generation PLCs was very similar to that of Ignition.  On the older generation however, after setting up 4 PLCs in Kepware, the data refresh rates were so slow that they were unusable (several seconds when trying to achieve sub-second responsiveness in the system as a whole) and we are typically only reading tag counts in the 10 -  150 range per PLC.  After working with PTC Tech Support to try and improve the performance, their recommendation was to add another NIC for every PLC we needed to connect.  At that point we moved the older PLCs to Ignition's built-in driver, and after they released a driver for the new generation we started using that as well.

It's not usually a show-stopper nor does the solution require real physical NICs (I'll talk to Tech Support! We have a few new people who started this year), but it is certainly a Kepware design-inflicted problem that is a big stumbling block. I have personally scoped an architectural resolution with Product Management to correct and honestly this mention / quiet quit moment will be important for them to hear (again).

The current solution might be quick - you need to be able to make one channel per device (FINS-enabled PLC) in order to meet your performance requirement. However, without additional host OS configuration, you can usually only make one channel with the Omron FINs driver, putting all devices below the channel, sharing the driver, and yielding very slow comms.

You can do this - create one channel per device - as long as you have the option of assigning static IPs (receiving a bank of available IPs from IT perhaps). You can ""multi-home"" your single physical or virtual network adapter by adding additional IPs, and once done, Windows presents those additional IPs as available, independent NICs in the OS. DM if you want the Windows workflow. You'll bind each of those new NICs to a new channel in Kepware.

Context (because who doesn't love Ethernet protocols and history lessons) - like some other native UDP protocols such as BACnet, the authors of the FINS over UDP spec decided to require non-ephemeral, hard-coded source and destination ports. In Kepware, the Channel in most any  driver is the driver's state machine. Way back in the late 1990s, my colleagues decided that the state machine - the channel's thread - is the ""owner"" of a reserved UDP or TCP port - a port is not reserved ""by Kepware"" with some general thread and shared intelligently across multiple channels.","",""

The PLC executes a set of instructions based using the sensors as inputs and actuators as outputs.  PLCs are purpose built hardware and software to do this reliably and safely.  If you see an asset running (e.g., a press moving up and down, bioreactor agitating), the asset's PLC is driving this.

A SCADA is software that connects to PLCs.  It's used to monitor PLCs in an area or plant.  This monitoring can consist of visualization, alarming, logging, etc.  It also has the capability to control the PLCs.  This type of control are generally human inputs (e.g., start, stop, process parameters).  It's to ""influence"" the production process, but not ""control"" it.  The SCADA does not control the sensors, actuators and cycling of the asset.  The PLC does this.

The initial plan was to go for Ignition, since we have used it prior in other factories. But considering that 29/30 PLC's are Siemens, and already Siemens HMI's (comfort panels), it seems to be some advantages to go for WinCC instead. thinking about WinCC Unified. I have almost 0 experience with WinCC and only with Ignition. Anyone here that got experience comparing these two?

Are there synergies which lowers cost and implementation time going for Siemens WinCC when you have Siemens PLC's? If that's the case, when would it be justifiable to anyway choose another SCADA, e.g. Ignition? Here I'm assuming that you can copy paste visualizations and tagstructures from the Comfort panels if you go for WinCC but it would need to be done from scratch choosing Ignition. 

Thoughts?

You have WinCC TIA portal (from which I think you have Advanced and Pro versions, probably version 17 right now) then you have WinCC v6 (or maybe 7 idonno) then you have WinCC OA. These are 3 different products! With 30 PLCs, depennding on the amount of data trandsertd and read cycle times (assuming a lot more reads then writes) you may get away with WinCC TIA Portal Professional. Advantage there is that you can directly reuuse all the HMI faceplates (widgets) that you have on the HMIs and you can reuse all the PLC variables very easily. If you go v6 or OA I do not thing that you have any advantage from the dev environmnne point if view since those are not part of TIA portal so still a separate software like Ignition would be. Look at ""northbound"" interfaces how to integrate the SCADA further up (or make it part of your UNS or whatever your approach integration is), OA is definetly more capable there then any other versions.

To my knowledge there is no platform or tool purpose built for this. Historically I've worked on teams that maintain a database of ""tags"" generically defined. Each system would be responsible for having the ability to import into and export out of that database structure. This was however mainly done to streamline large documentation efforts in life sciences, not really to solve the problems in the post. We built flows in NodeRed that did the export / import functionality.

Wincc unified is also targeted to OT people; it's not worried about GIT for example. An ot guy wants  templates, that's way easier. No one cares that you can insert costum html5 code to have nice visuals. OT needs a motor to move and an operator needs to be able to start it from the screen. Nothing more, nothing less.

From working with Unified the main takeaways are; time to market was too short; first 2 versions (V16 & V17) were too buggy to be production worthy; from V18 on it's actually quite good software.

Drawbacks would be from an ot engineers perspective; 
- the overly complex licensing model (already way better then WinCC flexible,advanced,basic,(OA)) => people cant select and buy as is possible for ignition
-available features. (it's missing features that we're available in older siemens scada products) => migration is difficult but phase out is planned in 2025 for wincc advanced (Siemens is forcing everyone to migrate to unified)
- IP67 panels are hardly available yet
-UL certification for certain models is lacking

Advantages would be:
-Javascript instead of VBA (self explaining haha)
- Webbased options
- web, PC & panel based options available
- fully implemented in TIA portal ❤️

You could look at Litmus or HighByte to capture data and normalise and contextualise it into a single 'system'. And then add a GUI in whatever format you want.

However, some times it's implemented by a R&D team for a specific trial because that's what they used in college and it ends up being successful so they promote the machine to full production. Rather than revisit the software and architecture, they keep it and add some NI DAQs to communicate to half the VFDs and other I/O on the  machine and add a PLC which talks to the other half. The R&D team has moved onto other jobs and now 10 years later you have this solution that has very little local support because Labview is not the typical tool from the PLC integrators you work with.

Now I believe certain parts of automotive have strong Labview support with solid integrators around Michigan.

At the end of the day, it isn't just about deploying some awesome software and patching the immediate problem. Just because you can develop something cheaply doesn't mean you should and there should be definite warning bells if the business can't justify a solution financially.","",""

Why does every vendor make us learn new made up names for the same thing? To lock us in I guess?

Similarly, I've done some projects for a company where they worked for example with Rockwell FactoryTalk and Siemens OpCenter, but the company (mfg, end user) gave these products and their components different names internally (also completely made up).
This resulted in people having product experience (highly sought after in the job market) and them not knowing it, even listing (only) the company specific names on their cv, so only people who've worked with this specific company would know what their experience really was.

At a high level, data from SCADA includes data from PLCs in a supervisory context.  Imagine if one were sitting in a control room or in front of plant- or -area-level HMIs.  These would include current state and telemetry data of many assets.  This, in practice, is a subset of the data in the PLC, but often very valuable data for many use cases.  There might also be alarm and event data present.  In addition to this data, there may be additional context with human inputs.  The SCADA screens might have commands to automation, alarm acknowledgements, and other components users interact with.  These can be used to capture the ""intent"" of the automation (e.g., line 1 was started at 07:00 by operator x, but went down at 07:05 with alarm y, but was acknowledged at 7:10 citing reason z).

Sometimes the SCADA solutions don't have all drivers or functionality.  Or, there might be a desire to decouple device connectivity with a dedicated solution.  They'll use a protocol gateway that adapts the native device protocols into a normalized protocol like an OPC UA.

Interestingly, some SCADAs with device drivers internally normalize the data as an OPC UA or OPC DA server.

Typically I would have used Thin clients and the standard Thin client spec would be 2 ports and there would be plenty in stores.
And  for probably less cost than a Desktop with a graphics card for 4 ports, I would now have redundancy in my Plant room so if I desktop fails or reboots I have another one running. 

 That might be the difference between me needing to drive 50- miles to a plant at 3am to fix a PC or install a new one. and then by the time in Install the SCADA software the plant has been down for 4 hours. With a Second desktop the plant can run until I get in at a normal time.

And with the two desktop PC I used to have two OI servers( Intouch/Wonderware) so if the OI server crashed on the SCADS desktop it could use the OI server running on the backup.

The motivation was protection of human rights, children, environment and so on - the responsibility should not belong only to the final manufacturer but to the whole supply chain.

A random person trying out demo software is _not_ a business partner, however, and the software isn't part of anybody's supply chain at that point.

I'm not a naturally ordered mind, and I would be really worried that an Enterprise Ignition system would end up administrable because if deviations etc, especially where multiple vendors are working in the same  enterprise and I have different UDT's for different motors .

We're talking about a hypervision tool where all your business software solutions are integrated to display information, helping you analyses and take decisions. We're not referring to SCADA in this context, even though the UOC may be built on SCADA software (ASP + OMI), as it includes or can include much more.

At this level of control, direct command functionality isn’t necessarily a priority, although it's still possible to incorporate it. Many customers use various solutions at different levels of the stack (EMS, CMMS, ERP, MES, HMIs, dashboarding tools, etc.). For these customers, it can be challenging to quickly gather all the necessary information from these systems to make informed decisions.

One of the goals of UNS was to address this, but it doesn’t fully solve the need to centralize key visualization information on the same screens and have them work harmoniously by adapting to a changing context. The idea is that, within one container (OMI here), you can integrate as much key information as possible by embedding other software solutions. When the context in one changes, the others will automatically adjust to reflect the new context

I don’t yet have a comparison with other software, but based on what I’ve seen OMI accomplish (with around 30 out-of-the-box apps like PowerBI, Sankey, PLC code viewer, Pi Vision, map apps, graphic repeater, content presenter, etc.), it’s quite impressive. They also provide the ability to create your own apps by offering an SDK. This is why, in a nutshell, I can confidently say it’s much more powerful than Ignition for this particular use case.","",""

What I find particularly interesting about objects is their ability to include wizards for attributes, scripts, and graphics. If you associate these graphics with a symbol wizard it makes it very powerful. However, again, it’s not always necessary and yes it might become overkill for some customers.

Oh the SE rumor mill. 😂 This is the first I have heard this rumor though. It likely doesn’t make sense to switch out the historian in Geo scada. The historian is tightly, TIGHTLY integrated into the product. Plus it is performant for most queries and OT/HMI use cases. In my limited experience with PI and comparing them side by side; Geoscada historic queries almost always returned results faster than PI. On top of that It’s not really a module that can be easily “switched out” for something different, nor can I see how switching that part out would add value to the product at all. 

SE did take the alarm functionality from Geo scada and applied it to Citech in the mid-2010’s. Back when it seemed like they might merge the code bases. So there is precedent for switching parts of the software out. 

What I can also confirm is that Geo Scada has native connectors to export/stream historical data to WWH, eDNA, and now Aveva PI. The PI export stuff was added in the last major release.","",""

That's not even to say anything about the cost of implementing it... Monetary and employee morale.

That said. 

If it's already in place, especially if it's working for you - don't rip it out... Ripping out PlantPax and replacing it with Ignition is not just a SCADA swap but the PLC, Historian, and basically the entire architecture. It's an expensive and high risk project that is unlikely to have any real ROI. 

If it wasn't working for you, or causing other issues I might have a different recommendation... But don't rip and replace without a damn good reason.

PlantPAX is not I4.0 compatible but you can use some other tools to integrate the sites into a larger enterprise architecture that is.

Basically, PlantPAX will be a single, very large, node.

FactoryTalk Linx (OPC-UA) and FactoryTalk Historian are probably your best points to connect to.

I would probably look at tools like Flow Software and/or Highbyte to connect, collect, and analyze the data while bridging it you larger 4.0 architecture.","","💯 (3),highbyte (2)"

We have contemplated building an Ignition flavour of the library. The heavy lift to build, test, debug, then deploy it would be unreal for one company to do on their own, for maybe not a lot of benefit. 

Time to value is probably key here. Rip and replace doesn’t always generate a lot of immediate value. First thought for me is leave Plant PAx in place and find fast ways to get the data out to your UNS and digital infrastructure. Maybe Ignition is there beside FTV SE for a time to get data flowing?

Maybe this is sacrilege to say out loud but the Plant PAx building blocks are simply prescribed (aka supported) AB Control Logix or compact logix PLCs and I/O, coded with PAx instructions, connected to a FTV SE HMI, using PAx graphics design, on a prescribed network and server architecture. Plant PAx is marketed as a different product even though the system will have all the same components as a typical Rockwell control system with a FTV SE front-end. Its a marketing play with some added technical bits that enable the system to compete against other DCS systems more directly and eliminate the integrator wildcard. 

FTV SE (and by extension PlantPAx) is a dead-end for data flow for sure. It'll be alright for operator visualization and maybe light alarm management but not really a data platform. Its the HMI in the automation stack.

Reasons are many but besides the complete openness and price point: the majority of the plant is AB legacy PLCs and IOs which can be integrated into Ignition, and would have to be replaced if going for a PlantPax solution. In addition, I counted 7 stand alone systems which they today use VNC solutions for accessing. Integrating this into the next gen solution would be a great enhancement for them. I guess the list goes on but it makes sense to make the shift to Ignition. Thanks for all your valuable insights @Dylan DuFresne @CTownKyle @Dustin Symes @Jake Cunningham @Mark O'Donovan","","👍 (6)"

As for tools, we use:
- project-scan module
- tag ci/cd module
- github with mostly gitflow

It seems like these systems are kept separate from SCADA because of data structure and frequency of polling as guided in the IEEE C37.118 standard. I’ve just never come across a system like that before, it’s foreign to me","",""

There are other open sources tools available to integrate this type of data with a PI Historian. The main hurdle for more SCADA integrations with respect to PMUs is the relatively high data monitoring rate compared to a lot of SCADA systems polling rates so you typically need to set these up as a separate data source or manage some higher speed polling in your SCADA system which can put a drain on your resources if you are looking at more than a handful of phasors. 

Siemens has some hardware options that can help manage this as well. https://www.siemens.com/us/en/products/energy/energy-automation-and-smart-grid/protection-relays-and-control/general-protection/phasor-measurement-unit-pmu.html","",""

I've been working on a technical comparison document between major SCADA platforms – including Ignition, Niagara Framework, Siemens WinCC, AVEVA Plant SCADA, and GE iFIX – with a focus on:

Building automation and water/wastewater systems
Licensing models and scalability
Protocol support (BACnet, OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus)
Edge computing and Unified Namespace
Open data access and integration with IT systems

📝 I’ve tried to keep it practical, vendor-neutral, and based on real-world use cases.
💬 I’d love your feedback in a private messeage – especially if:

Something is technically inaccurate
You see bias in any direction
You think there’s something missing or could be explained better
You have field experience that could help strengthen the conclusions","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740336204242747503/1423194618605867038/Sammenligning_scadasystemer_-_English.docx?ex=68df6cc6&is=68de1b46&hm=df54b9a47f055cea53016c7bcb960440e1d296d096c59d00c15e569cbd348647&",""
