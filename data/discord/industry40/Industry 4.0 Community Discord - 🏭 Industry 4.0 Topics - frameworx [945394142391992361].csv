What about learning via tutorials etc, still imited to 30 days?

This is part of a series where I‚Äôm experimenting with real-world dashboard techniques ‚Äî one principle at a time ‚Äî and testing how well different tools support them.

Would love to hear your feedback, experiences, or critiques.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945394142391992361/1388639293333049425/deviation_actualvstarget_bars_frameworx.png?ex=68def51f&is=68dda39f&hm=6583db90b1d29378e18d7e65b8e99a99434823d71afa5959b12adef63269645b&","üî• (1)"

Just wrapped up a second Deviation test using FrameworX ‚Äî this time focused not on how far values are from target, but how long they've been out of limits.

‚è±Ô∏è Duration of deviation
üìç Timestamp when the issue started
üìâ Markers that appear automatically when a value drifts out of range

These time-based indicators help operators spot persistent issues and make smarter, faster decisions.

You can see the test visuals and implementation notes here:

These are reusable dashboard patterns that combine multiple SA principles into practical strategies operators can use. The first one is about keeping displays **user-driven and flexible**:

üîÄ Filters to adjust focus without losing context
üö® Alerts always visible, regardless of goal shifts
üìë Tabs/links for deeper analysis when needed

I built a demonstration in FrameworX to show how this works in practice:
