Course KPI which is a straight forward calculation, but has confounded components. For example availability, as a rule, is typically placed at the feet of the maintenance team when in reality all DT is not due to maintenance. (E.g. operator misloads machine and a jam occurs, upstream product has dimensional variation which jams the machine).","","ü§î (1)"

Is the reject due to the machine currently working on the part or from the upstream machine which produces the marginal sub assembly.

And very few properly account for the upstream and downstream interdependencies of all three metrics.  Bottom line is that they're all rather unreliable in the real world.  Add to that how many OEE/downtime tracking systems ask the operator to specify the reason (at a time when they should be focused on getting the line up and running) and you tend to get garbage information on balance.

Many MES implementations will implement rejection tracking at a line or asset.  It will only capture planned scrap due to setup or or really obvious process issues.  They'll pat themselves on the back.  Meanwhile, another downstream operation or even a customer is detecting the the non-conformances that originated at that line or asset.

Depending on the quality process, production batch size, and how unusual the non-conformance is; it might considerable time to detect.

I'm more in the former category provided it's used correctly.  You seem to have collected much of the datapoints that you will need to create the metric, now the challenge is to build the metric itself.  My view on this is that the three components of OEE, throughput, quality, and availability should be weighted depending on the requirements of the organization.  If the company is in an industry like pharma, they're probably going to really care about the quality aspect, while a facility that is manufacturing low cost goods is probably going to be more concerned about throughput.  Just remember, OEE really only works once a baseline has been established and is really only meant to be an indicator.

Once you get rolling with this, you may want to additional inputs, for instance, we've seen a couple places create an operator input tag, where the operator can select a reason for downtime.

Further, like any indicator, they need to be audited every so often to ensure that they aren't being manipulated, or that they are still valid.

If you believe that for all the machines in all manufacturing the UPH is ONLY what the machine manufacturer wrote in the spec as max speed, you are wrong. As you probably hinted, the UPH has a lot to do with the Product that you run on that line, on that machine. Let's talk about your iPhone. Placement machine manufacturers are doing a dodgy thing and rate the max speed of the IC placement machines using a single type of component (usually a passive, something easy to pick and place) and run the tests. Open up your iPhone and you will see that you don't have only resistors or capacitors there....you have 100+ different types of electronic parts from passives to ICs, BGAs, LGA and at least 80+ different sizes... When you load the placement machines with a real BOM then the theoretical max speed of the placement machine is becoming a faraway dream... What do you have to do? Use specialised software to optimise the sequence of the placements, and distribute the parts on multiple machines in order to increase the takt time and smooth out the difference in cycle time between machines. And you get what? Max 80% of the theoretical max speed is your achievable operational max... If the manufacturers of the machines would be more honest...maybe you can achieve UPH closer to their theoretical max. SMT lines have pretty complex UPH calculations depending on hundreds of factors and the performance of your optimisation software that has to optimise perfectly for speed and quality thousands of placements... something like this https://youtu.be/ylk6VMBLrvM","",""

Where are your biggest opportunities? I asked. ""I have no idea"", was his honest response. 
""We have a bunch of performance reports, but they are all bullshit. Our performance is heavily influenced by product mix and schedule, and the reports don't take that into account""
The site manager is a rising star within the company, and for good reason. He had managed to lift the performance of the site across a broad range of measures. When I asked how he did it, I was not surprised by his answer, but it is sad for the state of the industry.
""I spent months out here with a clip-board and a stop watch doing time and motion studies. Turns out our bottle neck is not what we thought, and it moves around depending on the product and order sizes. We got the improvement through basic scientific method and a lot of hard work""

lower the energy cost or the Usage per unit and you get more profit for the same OEE.


To me its a bit like BMI. People love to point out how athletes have high muscle mass and ahigh BMI but they are healthy.

Currently I am working on a case where I think OEE could be used to control systems and the quality of the product instead of only using it for monitoring and I am curious whether anyone has used this. 
The case in short; I have a system which can and should execute 2 processes on each single product after each other but the processes can execute in parallel within the system on 2 different products, so product 1 has been processed with process A and being processed with process B and product 2 is being processed at process A. Each product is unique and this implies different processing times for process A and B.
The performance (OEE-P) of the system is determined by the slowest process and the quality of the product (OEE-Q) can be influenced by the time a process is executed, e.g. taking more time will improve the quality.
As such, a decline in OEE-P has an positive impact on OEE-Q and vice versa.
Could you in this case use the overall OEE-P*Q finding the optimum for each specific process / product?
Or can you also apply the concept of OEE on a product instead of on the equipment determining the ""Overall Product (production) Efficiency"" for each individual product and adjust the system accordingly?

I woudl rather use other KPI's than Modified OEE i.e.:

   ** Defect Density:** This measures the number of defects found per unit produced.
   ** Scrap Rate: **This measures the amount of waste produced as a percentage of total production.
   ** Cycle Time: **This measures the total time from the beginning to the end of your process, including process time, during which a product is being worked on, and delay time, during which a product is waiting in a queue.
    **Downtime in Proportion to Operating Time:** This is a direct measure of availability. It measures the proportion of time that a system is operational.
    **Rate of Return:** This measures the number of products returned or repairs needed as a percentage of total products sold.
    Production Cost: The cost associated with producing each unit. It's essential to keep track of this to maintain profitability.
   ** Customer Order Cycle Time**: This measures how long it takes from the time a customer order is received until the product is delivered to the customer.
    Inventory Turns: The number of times that the inventory is sold or used in a given period.
   ** Capacity Utilization: **This measures how close the manufacturing plant is operating to its maximum potential output.

and it is better to start with the basics well know exercises( so OEE)  rather than highly specific ones. It is easier to get guidance on how to have correct form and easier to find trainers who can help you with the form.

If I can afford to hire the best process improvement people and a great integrator to implement the system in the business perfect. But that is like me hiring Jillian Michaels as my PT. It's not affordable 

If you are able to hire a personal trainer who comes to your house, and you have kitted out the gym with the machines they specified, and they are they to guide you on you form as you do it, 100%$ there are better exercises than the basic well know ones.

But if your a 18 year old who is training at the YMCA, and only have the machines ow free-weights available. better to use ones that you can look up on you tube.
And if you load up the racks you can damage yourself. But if you talks to the old timers, and start slowly i thinks its had to be in a worse position than not going to the gym at all.

So even still I would say for a small to medium manufacturing plant that wants a KPI as they Digitally transform , and they know nothing else my advice would be. 
- Start with OEE  (Basic Exercises)

Use OEE, learn from it and you will discover new ways to use it or enhance it. I've had various 'Performance Dashboards' for years displayed in production and what I know is even without pushing the operators to do more, they tried to do more once we went through the motion, explained the targets  and they saw that they lack behind when is relatively easy to do more.

"1062141307121827910","sandves","2023-07-20T02:53:37.9990000+08:00","Hello everyone! I have some questions regarding utilization and OEE.

I am a consultant currently working for a manufacturing company that is producing parts primarily for the oil and gas industry (sub sea). They mostly do high mix low volume make-to-order manufacturing where CNC machines are the most important machine assets. I think around 60% of the parts they produce are new parts that they make for the first time.

They have an IIOT solution that is collecting data from the machines and they have a simple utilization calculation that they call ""power-on utilization"". This is basically *uptime / total power-on time*. It does not take into account planned production time, performance or quality which makes it a rather weak KPI in my opinion. The uptime / downtime classification is based on machine states, which gives them some insight about the different downtimes but I would say it is insufficient as a foundation for improvements. You get to see how much time was spent in idle, alarm, manual mode etc. but you don't know why. Was it idle for an hour due to inspection of the part? Was it setup or change-over? Planned service? First of all, have you ever heard of this way of calculating utilization before? Is it an established KPI?

I started looking into OEE and thought it would be a natural next step from this simple calculation. I learned that OEE is also a super simple mathematical expression. The hard part is collecting the data required to derive the three factors of OEE accurately.

**Availability**
In order to calculate availability I would need to integrate with the ERP system to find info about shifts, planned orders. I guess I need to look up data about planned maintenance from a maintenance system. What about classification of downtimes in the machine? I do not wish to demand that operators spend time on manually classifying downtimes. I also doubt that data quality would be any good. Do you normally try to do this automatically or give them suggestions?

**Performance**
I can easily find good count and planned production time in the ERP system, but how on earth do you calculate ideal cycle time in an environment with high mix and mostly new parts that has never been made?

**Quality**
Good parts and scrapped parts are fine. But who is to be ""punished"" for the scrap? Is it the asset that scrapped the part, or is it the neighbouring asset spending the rest of the week doing rework? 

What about NCE's / deviations? Parts could be rejected and returned from the customer months after it was manufactured. How should this affect OEE?

**Scope / time frame**
If understand these factors correctly, OEE could not be used as a real time KPI (which many seem to do anyway ü§î). It has to be evaluated over a period of time. What scope or time frame do you suggest? Day, shift, work order, anything else?

It seems like everyone is finding OEE so easy and therefore it makes sense to start with OEE and build other KPIs down the road. I have to admit that I am bit pessimistic about developing a robust solution with an OEE based on high data quality within a reasonable budget. I also feel it would require some sort of cultural change management if they want to benefit from OEE. In my experience, the focus has been to tweak the calculations or do ""hacks"" in the processes to boost the utilization numbers. Instead, I think the focus should be on the underlying factors and shed light on all the losses so that you know where to focus your improvement work. Who is OEE meant for actually? ü§î 

Am I overthinking this?

In our industry, the cement production industry, due to the irregularity of the raw materials and alternative fuels' quality and physical characteristics, we don't rely much on real-time KPIs, especially at a management level. Most of our Production, Quality, and Maintenance KPIs are all period-based averages (event or time-based), integrations, etc.: ""Shift average electric specific consumption (kWh/t)"", ""Month average productivity (t/h)"", ""YTD MTBF (h)"" are some examples. Therefore, historical data is needed to perform these calculations.
Since the UNS' MQTT broker, by definition, only stores the last value of each variable, there is no elegant way of achieving this in Ignition. The apparent solution (and in reality, it's how we are handling it currently) would be to calculate everything in the historian. However, we are striving to avoid proprietary scripting languages (as we learned that lesson the hard way).
Another alternative would be to perform these calculations in the AWS infrastructure (or some other cloud provider) using the specific time-series tools available. Our concern in this case revolves around the cost of transmitting the necessary tens of thousands of variables per plant, each with a resolution of a few seconds, to the cloud.
Your insights are highly valued.

I've been a member of the discord channel and recently started working for Intellic Integration. I came to them with a strong background in building analytical resources to manage KPIs. What attracted me to Intellic and the UNS concept was the need to move all events to a common platform and my prior experience with MES systems not scaling up to support the granularity of data needed for a Real-time enterprise.

You're right, KPIs often require an aggregation of data for calculations. I'm currently working on a solution that uses IA as the middleware component and leverages event sourcing to efficiently handle all the data as strongly typed inserts. From this, I'm planning to create a star schema data warehouse. Tools like Tableau and Power BI prefer this structure, aligning with best practices. By establishing a star schema, you can easily define KPIs across various dimensions, including calendar dates, product attributes, or other operational factors, and have them work seamlessly over days, weeks, months, etc.

Cloud providers often push the adoption of these mature data practices, but they can also be implemented with local hardware and equipment. Integrating a Data Vault framework in between allows us to add custom attributes to the events and version the history of things like setpoints.

I know this might seem complex, but the end goal is to provide a flexible and efficient way to manage the specific KPIs you mentioned, all within a structure that can be tailored to the unique needs of the cement production industry.

I'd be happy to discuss further or provide any additional information if needed.","","üî• (1)"

While our approach utilizes IA and MS SQL, it's not tied to any specific technology. It's crucial to distinguish between creating a BI resource and the decision to move data to the cloud. Cloud providers often blur these lines for marketing reasons, but by focusing on the necessary architecture, we can avoid vendor lock-in and keep costs low.

Furthermore, by leveraging Low-Code development practices, augmented with LLM coding assistance, we can speed up our work and utilize established models. This approach not only accelerates development but also enables customers to use these models as an expert system. In light of recent advancements, we should all reconsider our estimations on what we can develop in-house based on LLM advancements.

The tie-in with the UNS is that it allows for a reference back to the originating point of the data, providing analysts with a single contact point when they need to know where data came from.

By focusing on strongly typing our originating events, we can better support plans to leverage platforms like Snowflake. When we considered methods that would move everything in the UNS up to the cloud, it became apparent that we needed to be more selective. This approach still supports the fundamental benefit of establishing the semantic name space, allowing us to meet our goals without incurring unnecessary costs or complexity.","",""

IF there were a number of defects from the same batch in the F&B I have worked with, there would be an analysis of that batch to see if the underlying cause could be and to take steps to prevent it in the future .

but ""Quality"" in the OEE sense is surely a measure of the known percentage of product in a saleable condition at the end of the manufacturing process.

But some of your example seam to me to be places with poor culture, one of blame where shortcuts are taken. That is not the fault of using OEE, any measure. The measure says there is a problem, that a machine is not performing to where it could, it cannot be inferred that the problem is with that machine/operator/crew.

But where you have online quality inspection, e.g. Weight, Weight Check, cap torque, product label, GHS Label , Hazard label, other hazard label. capturing the amount of failed tests gives value.
or if you can capture the weight of product that goes into Bins( locally at the line) you can get some important understanding of where the massive pile of waste in the yard is coming from.

1) They can work to improve the system

**1. Planned vs. Reality**
- Comparing planning from SAP (Yield, Scrap or anything) and real data from the plant floor from Litmus Edge 
- Push data from Litmus Edge to SAP and draw a chart.
- Optimize in the upcoming runs. 

**2. OEM Spec vs. Reality **
- Compare an asset/machine spec vs what is the current runtime reality 
- A beer bottle packaging machine had 12000 / hour in spec, and they were doing 11,400 / hour even at the spec speed (this is what the customer got from Litmus Edge + Siemens + Data loggers combo). 
- They asked OEM to find the bottleneck and optimize it. They are a happy customer for life.

**3. Total Volume NOT Produced today. **
- This is a financial KPI. It directly goes to¬†the P&L¬†holder and¬†, in some¬†cases, the¬†board.¬†
- How much were a plant supposed to produce vs. how much were we produced? 
- We had a big fight between the plant manager and corporate about this KPI.

**4. Batch deviations **
- Compare realtime 50-60 variable golden batch vs current. 
- Used for long-running and precious chemical processes 
- Identify early indications via ML and dump the batch if needed. 

**5. Smart Asset Health (this is an amazing one!)**
- A customer created a custom asset health KPI in the Litmus Edge analytics layer.
- Merging Utilization / some ML predictions / previous failover combinations. It was the multiplication and division of many KPIs 
- Did a trend/prediction on that custom Smart Asset Health and schedule maintenance. 
- They push that KPI to Ignition / FTView as well for incremental feedback from the operator.","","üôè (4),üëç (4),üî• (2)"

Theoretical cycle times can vary product, process, asset / workcenter, tooling, labor resources, etc. Beyond tracking performance, this especially important for scheduling. It's important to factor in these as constraints to determine realistic capacity or throughput.

The ERP layer should define the products, BOMs, routings (operations/processes), and the compatible workcenters than can run the process. There should be a theoretical rates (standard rate, ideal rate, etc) defined for each possible production configuration. You could even get more granular having rates down to the resource level.

It's super important to audit and maintain these rates. It's good to have both an automated and manual way of doing this. Ideally, machine programs should have cycle timers that can be monitored. Adding a time study as a step to an engineering change workflow is not a bad practice.

So, when a work order is scheduled to a particular workcenter, one can utilize the relevant rate for calculating performance metrics. 

From a reporting standpoint, if you have a lot of variation in the theoretical rates, it might make sense to include a comparison of relative (e.g., OEE, efficiency) and absolute (qty produced) metrics as a reality check.

As for how things like OEE is reported... Walker talks a lot about how if you set up your data such that its hierarchical to ISA95, you can 'roll up' OEE from cells to lines to areas to sites, etc. 

However, I am trying to make sense of how that works in practice. I probably don't want just some 'global, perpetual OEE' (performance, availability, yield over the machine's entire life). I want to have it for this shift, the last 24 hours, for a specific work order.

OK, maybe that isn't the biggest hurdle. Regardless if whether it's data thats coming from a PLC (cycle time, machine state, good counts, total counts) or from a higher-level system (shift start/end, target cycle time, etc.), it's consolidated to the UNS where it could be used as part of the OEE calculation. 

But the piece that's kinda missing for me is how to roll that into those different views: WO-specfic OEE, OEE over a specific period of time. Do people calculate WO OEE separate and apart from time-oriented OEE? Is there some way to get the former from the latter that I'm not seeing? Is it happening in whatever system is hosting the UNS or is it typically 'pushed' into the UNS by another system?","",""

For example, during a meeting with a company, I asked the production manager: if the theoretical machine capacity is 100 tons per day, but only 50 tons are produced due to low demand, why would we calculate the KPI based on 50 tons? This would show high efficiency and might not create pressure on the sales team. But is production separate from the rest of the business? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better for everyone to see the real reasons behind the issue and take action? Wouldn‚Äôt this create pressure on the sales department? Production will do its job well, but it won‚Äôt share the responsibility for sales.

Doesn‚Äôt this also mean that we might end up producing products we can‚Äôt sell? For instance, to avoid setup times, we might overproduce and stock excess inventory, increasing storage costs. No one will question this because the OEE looks high. Is this business truly efficient?

The pressure to keep machines running and not let efficiency drop could lead to wasting energy and resources unnecessarily.

For example, a company that couldn‚Äôt manage its inventory invested heavily in an automated warehouse. They spent ‚Ç¨2.5 million, and now they can store around 3,000 tons of products. But why are these products sitting in the warehouse? Why aren‚Äôt they being shipped? I integrated this warehouse with SAP, and at the time, it seemed like a fantastic investment. But now, when I reflect on it, it doesn‚Äôt seem right.

Whenever we say that OEE is still necessary, other critical KPIs are ignored by production. It feels like the business doesn‚Äôt operate as a whole. Using OEE appears to result in harmful outcomes.","",""

       - Do you just leave the last published value form the last time there was planned production?

Lets say you move to an over run of the Changeover, 
This is planned production time?
Do you set Downtime to 0?  or Set performance to 0? Do you particularly care?

lets say as part of changeover you run the machine, maybe at a 25% Rate? 
you do scrap about 50% of those parts, does it change your answer?
Is your A ,Q and P 

So the really hard question is lets say your changeover takes 30 minutes, 20 planned 20 unplanned.
For the first 10 minutes you produce nothing?
the second 10 minutes you run the machine and produce product. 
   -in that 10 minutes you produce 200 units and 150 are bad quality? 
  - What is the A, Q & P now? is 0EE 0 because you are in planned Downtime?
 At the end of the 10 minutes the operators are still not happy with the setup.
    - So they produce 300 units over these 10 minutes, and 250 are good quality
    - What is the A Q & P during this period?

The common formulas for A,P,Q are overly simplified, and don't state the assumptions behind them. If the assumptions and subsequent simplifications were not applied, the APQ formulas would all be units of ""effective time"" instead of ""counts"". This is also subtly hinted in oee.com documentation.

For example the common A formula assumes that input/output counts do not change during machine downtime (but the OEM provides state based on current draw of a motor and there is some lag, so unfortunately that assumption isn't perfect during state transitions). 2nd example, P/Q formulas assume constant standard rate. What if I run multiple materials?

OEE is (effective time spent making good parts)/(scheduled time). This is generally a lot easier to conceptualize/calculate then all the semantics that go into APQ calculations. If you want to accurately calculate OEE and OEEbased-APQ, start with the OEE calculation, then work backwards with the data you are provided to get A, P, Q formulas. The decisions made will be directly related to the quality of data/signals available, as you've stated.

One can argue if a loss of effective time is categorized as APQ, but a single loss event should not show up twice. How does the time spent making a bad part during unplanned downtime affect APQ and OEE vs if no part was made during that time? The OEE result should be the same. How does the time spent making a good part during unplanned  downtime affect APQ and OEE vs if no part was made during that time? Should OEE good counts match the count applied towards the work order? Micro stops should just push losses between A/P, but not affect OEE. Thinking in terms of ""effective time"" instead of ""counts"" makes these decisions more digestible.","","üëç (1)"

If there is no automated way to capture quality fallout from the machine, we can build manual systems that allow operators to input scrap quantity.

The goal of OEE is to help us measure improvement. Don't let perfect get in the way of better. If we can gain 1% of efficiency, that's a direct correlation to the bottom line. Don't get hung up on 85% OEE or some arbitrary number, use it as an indicator on if you're getting better, and as a tool to point you where to look for improvements.","","üëç (1)"

As for Quality, there's some things to be gleaned but a lot of defects are determined after-the-fact (color doesn't meet spec, high-spot on a plate creates a print defect the operator didn't catch). That's less clear to me about how to capture.

A lot of this leads me to believe there still needs to be an 'auditor' system above the raw data and that pulling details straight from a historian or something may work for showing to operators, but that may not be the final result for reporting and so-on.

Let's assume a demand signal from site. If demand is there that is scheduled. Availability becomes time running on demand.  If the demand signal is there and the pumps cannot run that is downtime.

Total time not running on demand( the well known TTNRD) might be a better kPI

Performance, do the pumps run at max speed. You could work something out.

Each cell has on board HMI and control, but there is no site wide system connecting the different assets. Each ""order"" is a unique house plan that consists of dozens of individually sized and shaped structures. Each order is broken down first into individual elements (walls or trusses) which are then broken into sub-elements (studs, lintels, beams, etc.) which are cut and assembled progressively at different equipment stations.

How would one account for the ""P""  component if there is no standard or optimal run rate? Due to each order being unique, and each assembly taking a different length of time, even when working at what might be the ""peak"" performance of the individual machines the throughput is going to be different.

They currently have no insight whatsoever as to their performance benchmarks, and are desperate to get some kind of baseline to evaluate individual shifts and lines.

For each machine determine the peak performance. Maybe it is feed rate or maybe it is units. And you stick with that and all performance is rated again that.

Easy to collect from sensors/PLC data, but high utilization doesn't mean high productivity. It can mask overproduction or show that machines are running inefficiently just to hit a metric.

Instead, you should track Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) with proper analysis of Availability, Performance, and Quality.

Just my thought.","",""

When I worked in shipbuilding, the individual trades had to answer for their cost on a weekly basis.  That said, nobody enforced where they ""got the bean"" from.  So trade supervisors would pick easy jobs out of sequence to avoid getting slammed in a meeting.   This caused heinous rework for other trades.

As an area supervisor it was our job to manage the trades in our area, and ensure they were following the right build order, and it was a constant battle.  What made it worse was that the plan itself had a ton of errors in it.

The experienced ship superintendents knew to focus on build order, and the cost would follow, and not to beat up the trades every week.","",""

What message do these KPIs really need to convey?

For plant managers, one key question is often:
""How far are we from target?""

A simple but powerful metric for that is ‚Äú% of target.‚Äù
AND when paired with the right visual design, it can communicate performance much faster than text alone ‚Äî especially when you need to quickly spot what‚Äôs off and compare multiple KPIs

Attached is a visual exercise I built in FrameworX. The goal  is to make it easy to see which KPIs need attention, and how well (or poorly) each one is performing.

*I think the main point is to shift the conversation from ""What KPI's do I need to see in my report/monitoring"" to ""what's the message I need to be delivered in my report/monitoring"". *

In this example dashboard the intended message to be delivered is ""**Visually, this is how far you are from target**""; instead of just showing Value-Target pairs, which for the brain it's harder to extract the same message.

For example I worked in a plant which made bulk chemicals in a batch process. We had cycle times anywhere from 12 hrs to 60hrs to make one batch and the batch sizes could range from 30k lbs to 110k so do you have a completely variable target depending on what you‚Äôre making? Based on target cycle time and start time? Based on yield? Business typically measures total volume per month but a plant manager wants to know how we are doing today according to the plan. Not only that but customer orders frequently change to the point we could schedule for up to 60 days but it would frequently change and demand also had seasonal changes","",""
