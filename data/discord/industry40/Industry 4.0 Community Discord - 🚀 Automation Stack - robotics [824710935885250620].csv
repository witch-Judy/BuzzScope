Through our continued work with OEMs, machine builders and end users, we are finding that the latest knowledge in the field of robots and their applications can also be applied in the field of cobots, which are emerging as a significant force in the market for industrial automation. Although the number of cobots installed in the field still generally lags behind the number of installed industrial robots, discussions about the merits of stronger and easier-to-use units ‚Äì and their potential problems ‚Äì are still ongoing. So, why now? One prevalent factor is that businesses want to find new ways to costeffectively automate their production, while increasing productivity across their applications. Moreover, a project applied successfully for a customer in  one country, or one plant, is very likely to be also adapted by other premises or countries in the group. The answer to the rise of the cobots is its development and launch of new product ranges, such as the JMHZ series of grippers and JSY series of valve blocks. These systems have maximum gripping force and flow, while maintaining minimum dimensions and weight. Another example of development is the deployment of modern technology and valve block control via wireless communications.

Niche products like AGV/AMR stand a lot to gain by leveraging the platform.  As far as becoming a core part of a production process, the adoption of ROS will be complicated.  The robot hardware itself will be a major factor.  Most industrial ROS applications I‚Äôm aware of have been with a ‚Äúbrownfield‚Äù approach.  That is, ROS functions as a supervisor or management shell for a commercially available industrial robot.

ROS adoption in industry is still extremely low.  Many of the integrators and personnel in the robot industry aren't aware of the technology.  I believe a major factor is that largest consumers of robots deploy them for high-volume production and, hence, don't perceive the benefits of the technology.  They started using robots precisely because they did not have to be flexible.  Think material handling, assembly, welding, or painting for dedicated production lines.  Because these firms have already invested in the infrastructure, the marginal cost of continuing to use it on new deployments or maintaining existing ones is very low.  They would have to be utilizing robotics in a different way or with a different mindset to realize the benefits of ROS.

Another factor is the ""industrial worthiness"".  Fanuc, for example, has a very robust network of support.  It's easy to obtain parts, talent, training, etc.  The second-hand, refurbished market is incredible.  It's very evolutionary technology and extremely dependable.  Even if one is still using proven Fanuc hardware they're familiar with, it's a massive leap-of-faith putting a new third-party supervisor on top of it.  They don't have many resources to lean on for support if they run into issues.  Anecdotally, I can find more people across three continents that know the Fanuc SDK (""KAREL"") than ROS.  I don't believe this is a coincidence.","","üíØ (1)"

Imagine replacing a turn-key DCS with open-source software while keeping the original hardware.  Even if the software is unequivocally better and should theoretically work, it is not an easy undertaking.  One must commit resources to manage the risks.  The assets can‚Äôt run without the DCS.  Most organizations are not setup to tolerate the short-term pain and work out bugs on-the-fly.  They will resort to a conservative posture.  I think of ROS as this on a much smaller scale.  It‚Äôs marrying a robot hardware to a new frontier of software.  It takes brains and courage to pull this off.

Where ROS is optimal is lower-volume, high-mix production.  The intelligence of ROS can make robot assets much more flexible and agile.  It can help enable a manufacturer to have scale and scope.  Solving the scale-scope dichotomy is one the major objectives of Industrie 4.0.  The challenge with lower-volume manufacturers is that they adopt automation much more conservatively.  It requires much more creativity achieving ROI.  They‚Äôre not trying to streamline a few processes that will cycle millions of times.  They have to make that investment work on a variety of processes.  Their problem space is much complicated.

The other key area where ROS could benefit is in vision.  Industrial robots are still somewhat primitive motion control systems.  It‚Äôs hard for them to intelligently interface with vision sensors.  A lot of context is missed between the vision and robotic nodes.  Additionally, there are all sorts of interoperability issues.  ROS could be an intelligent, less-proprietary domain to contextually bridge these nodes.","","üëç (3),üíØ (1)"

As to whether it can work with SpB, I think it comes down to the information modeling. I suppose it‚Äôs all theoretically possible. SpB, in most implementations, strikes me somewhat as a continuous data stream or exchange of I/O for SCADA applications rather than a service that is invoked. It‚Äôs not like a ‚Äúconversational‚Äù REST API. Logic must be introduced on both ends to constrain meaning and interpretation. That's not to say this is bad. SpB could have been conceived for more practical adoption instead of ""boiling the ocean"" with advanced features. It seems like a lot of the focus is on data acquisition as opposed to control. I can‚Äôt fault this as there is a ton of pent-up value here -- particular in brownfield contexts. There's enough of a harvest to eat for years. Beyond this, I think there is a lot potential for enhancing the payloads for more intelligent supervisory control. Industrie 4.0 is not just about obtaining greater visibility, but also producing more flexibly.

In this demo, they‚Äôre making use of the methods facet. It exposes what the device can do, can receive commands, confirm, etc. It‚Äôs a full semantic handshake.

The really unfortunate part about this demo is there is nothing available on how to recreate it. I don‚Äôt even know that you could go to Kuka, Beckhoff, SAP, etc and place an order to enable something like this. This is why I think adoption is bigger problem than some of the technical critiques (e.g., heaviness, verbosity, openness). Outside of a booth at Hannover Messe or SPS IPC Drives, it‚Äôs relatively impractical to do this in the real-world.","",""

- Code inside the robot was hard to maintain. Everything is numerical addresses. Sure, there are areas where those addresses can be named, but not all. And those names are not displayed when you're in the ladder editing environment.
- You're more limited on what you can display to the user on the robot pendant. An HMI can be powerful for displaying the right information at the right time.

Besides that, look at bright machines....this is a concept i directly contributed to, but not in its current form (was part of V1 in F500). This is a modular robotic cell, easy program, standard mechanical assembly automation tasks.

It has it's quirks and learning curve, but it's remarkably consistent.  On the other hand, it's like they never really got over their ""divorce"" with GE and are stuck in the past.  It feels, from interfacing and manageability perspective, like ancient technology.  There's no one engineering or development environment.  All the functionality is spread across different PC apps, teach pendent menus, packages/options, manuals, etc.  My biggest gripe is that they have no true self-serve resources to discover capabilities.  It always requires calling someone or ordering some obscure printed manual or CD-ROM.  But, their support is generally very knowledgable.   When one considers all the ways its been deployed, it's really resilient technology.  Additionally, the second-hand/refurb market and MRO availability is incredible.  It's also not hard to find talent familiar with it.  It's really a lesson that it's not always the ""best"" technology wins.

The motion envelope visualization for example is a feature you only get it much more expensive software. My problem with is is that I personally do not like software which streams motion the a robot ( the lookahead and path smoothing functions are more programatic, not realy real-time anymore in most cases, stuff like that). This is required to their online re-planning feature. For ABB it could work OK-ish, for KUKA not so much, reasons have to do with intricate (safety) details of their tech stack. I do not know if they do generate robot source code for the cusomer, but they are pushing you towards their ""motion streaming"" solution, which I do not appreciate.

You have to have the right plugins and libraries activated on the robot (in some cases they have a significant cost). I assume you have to do some electrical wiring also on some robots (not all of them accept the deadman switch over CIP safety, very few except this). They use a different programming langauge then your robot, and stream the motions somwhow (how they stream depends on the robot type) to the robot. I am not surprised they do not support KUKA, se my remark above about streaming and KUKA. I am concerned by the fact that they do not have an estop on the pendant! (they do have a safety functionality like the deadman switch so... an e-stop would have been nice). It is nice to program all your robots on the same language, that is definetly true, but I would not expect that all robots will behave exactly the same way (I am talking about very minor details here) just because the interface used to connect the pendant to the robot is very very different. I do belive that representing the robot program in a visual way helps a bit with productivity, if you do not have experience in a certain robot programming language, but it is not a big productivity booster, since you still have to actually program the thig.

My ""turing test"" for robot hands (and vision/navigation) is for it to walk into a dimly lit room, where it will see a jar on a middle shelf on the other side of the room that contains a random mix of M&M candies and M&M peanut candies. Now the robot must leave the room. The jar will be moved a couple inches, and the lights will be turned off. The robot will then return back in (in the dark), find the jar, take the lid off of the jar, and take out precisely 4 M&M candies (in one shot, and no peanut M&Ms). Note that the robot will not be able to see into the jar because it is on a middle shelf and will have to do it completely on ""feel"" with its grippers. It will have needed to navigate to the shelf and the jar using a remembered spatial model of the room and its belongings from its first trip in.

As the owner of a system integrator company specializing in real-time SPC, gage calibrations, and MSA studies, we are considering expanding our services to include visual inspection and collaborative robots (corobots). We are located in Dallas Texas, and Monterrey Mexico.

We are currently exploring options from different manufacturers such as TM, UR, ABB, and dobot. I would greatly appreciate any insights, experiences, or recommendations you might have with these platforms.

Used as a  marking ploy initially, but the rules for robots are universal.  By visual inspection I am assuming you mean automated inspection using a vision system.  Yes there is a large market for it.  I would also add it's a market with different levels of risk.   Vision system development can be very simple and quite complex.  manipulating a camera with a robot is the simple part.  I have seen my fair share of vision system integrators loose their shirts on jobs because they oversimplified the inspection requirements.  As you indicated you specialize in MSA.   Depending on applications I have seen poorly designed systems horribly fail GR&R due to over simplifications by the integrator.  As far as robots go I would keep your options open.   Fanuc, ABB, Kuka are always good go to's. They have been the main players in the industry and have developed their controllers over decades of experience.   Epson,Stabuli do well in the SCARA market.   UR's not bad for a ""cobot"" but not my first choice.  Id rather purchase a Fanuc and get world class reliability.  One other aspect to focus on is your programming workflow.  There are a lot of offline packages out there these days.  I have used a few of them.  Hands down I would look at Octopuz.  Fanuc has roboguide.  I personally hate it.  Fanuc makes software Like SAP makes UI's.  ABB has robot studio.  It's good and cost effective but has path generation limitations for certain applications.  I forget what Kuka has but they have something as well.  Octopuz is Fairly universal with the Robot platform,  So you can program pretty much any vendors robot with it.  The workflow is decent.     Hope this helps.","",""

One of the trends I've been observed is a decline in all the cobot hype.  Companies like UR did a fantastic job marketing their products in the last decade, but it didn't really change the game in industrial automation.  While it may have inspired people to think about deploying robots differently, they took more of an evolutionary change.  They added more vision, simulation or more intelligent safety systems (e.g., zoning, pausing).  Most robots are still behind guarding though.  They're optimized for speed and reliability over collaboration.  Cobots didn't really make the tried-and-true practices of industrial robots go away.  They just evolved slightly with complementary technology.

Another trend is that normal industrial robots could be augmented with more advanced safety systems.  For example, Veobot's Free Move product allows one to interlock vision with an industrial robot's safety bus.

Fanuc, ABB, and Kuka dominate most material handling, painting/welding, and inspection applications.  They have strong ecosystems with talent available around the world.  They also have excellent secondary / refurbished markets.  Industrial robot technology, believe it or not, actually evolves very slowly.  In most projects, the latest functionality may not be necessary.  There are now robots that are about 10-15 years old with mainstream ethernet fieldbus support, integrated safety, and simulation.  Pairing this with a modern PLC with integrated safety+motion provides a lot of flexibility and value.  Anything with a modern Fanuc R-30 controller with the right connectivity options is hard to beat.  It's not flashy and it's a bit quirky at first, but it just works.  

Another thing to consider is making sure robots are licensed with sufficient position registers.  This helps more intelligently integrate routines and recovery programs into the overall automation of a cell.  It makes it easier on operators, technicians, etc.","",""

Engineering a reliable and repeatable inspection process is significantly more challenging than engineering a material handling process.  Most overlook that robots aren't actually precise and repeatable enough for many inspection applications.  Often, the real ""magic"" happens in end-of-arm-tooling and fixture design.  People try to take shortcuts here to reduce cost, but it usually ends up coming back to haunt them.  If the mechanical process is not stable, then the inspection process will not be stable.  Robots exacerbate this problem.

The most advanced non-contact surface condition and metrology stuff with robotics I've seen is with SmartRay and MVTec Halcon.

More important than market size is finding customers with sufficient technological maturity and reasonable expectations.  There are a lot of manufacturers that build lazy business cases for automating inspection on the basis of solely reducing labor costs.  What they fail to realize is that they can't completely outsource the problem.  They have to develop some internal capability and take some ownership of the solution.  Those that are successful don't look for a 12 month payback on eliminating a labor-intensive inspection process.  Instead, they look for how to adopt the technology broadly throughout their operations and collaborate with their vendors.  Once they understand this, they will have a better understanding of where the technology works and delivers value.  In other words, it's not a simple 1:1 replacement of labor with capital.  Anyone who tries to outsource strategy and know-how about their process in a turn-key solution is asking for trouble.

Finally, don't believe everything the hardware vendors say.  Most aren't ""true"" application engineers.  They're sales people that can run demos.","","üëçüèª (1),üíØ (2)"
