Dear ProveIt! Community,

We regret to announce that due to the logistical challenges of coordinating two concurrent conferences in the US and the EU within six months, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the EU portion of ProveIt! 2025. We understand this news may be disappointing and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We came to this difficult decision in the best interest of providing the best experience for our audience and vendors.

While our U.S. team and EU partners could likely pull off the concurrent shows, in Thursday's team meeting, Walker asked the team, ""If we continue with both… will we have the same quality in the EU as we will provide in the U.S.?"" The team reluctantly conceded this was not possible, and Walker made the decision to put all of the team’s efforts into the Dallas venue.

What’s Next?
Ticket Options: We invite our EU attendees to apply the cost of their EU ticket purchase towards a US ticket for the Dallas conference from February 18-20, 2025. Alternatively, full refunds are available for those who cannot attend the Dallas event.

Future Plans: We are committed to bringing ProveIt! to Europe in the future and will provide updates as soon as possible.

We appreciate your understanding and continued support. For any questions or concerns, please contact us at contact@proveitconference.com.

Stay connected for more updates, and we look forward to seeing you at ProveIt! 2025 in Dallas!

Sincerely,
The 4.0 Solutions and ProveIt! Conference Teams

We are receiving some great feedback from End users and System Integrators, for the approach Dell has taken to the Management and Orchestration of applications that integrate into the factory floor environment, the ability to deploy applications at speed across a site and multiple sites. 

In addition to this the ability to connect, secure and manage a growing number of Edge devices  (gateways, servers). 

Eaton, Bosch and ATOS  are already benefiting from the use our NativeEdge platform and with multiple POC’s running with Manufacturers we aim to bring more learning to the Conference and attendees. 

Litmus, Telit, Cognex, Schneider and Claroty represent a few of the ISV’s we are working with who are integrated into the NativeEdge platform or soon will be. We are also seeing customers looking to develop their own apps for NativeEdge.

We are currently engaged in a couple of large projects with Dell. My point of view -  

1. Day 0: When pre-provisioning the hardware (rugged or server0, they ensure the root of trust at the factory level before shipping it to customers. 
2. Day 0 : They load hypervisor / native edge directly as well as pre-load apps if needed.
3. At Day 1 : They provided the best way to orchestrate complex applications—VM or containerized. It's a form-based system that provides the whole app.
4. Day 2 : Full cycle of management, update, rollback, security, alerts, logs and more. 
5. Day 2 : They take care of complex app-to-app orchestration.
6. Beyond Day 30 : Take the same templates and instantly replicate the whole infra to many sites.

Dell does provide a fully integrated solution which has a lot of value but it does lock you into dell infrastructure. A lot of the capability the dell solution provides is just applying modern DevOps best practice in a single solution. Aka the architecture I’ve developed we have a lot of the same capability but we can deploy on nutanix, dell, etc.

That being said the dell solution probably makes a lot of sense for sites that don’t have the expertise internally to build or sustain on their own.","",""

You only mention one point, which is that buying Dell hardware shouldn't be too much of a constraint.  But even if being married to Dell isn't that big of a deal, the second point is that the platform locks you into only the hardware Dell wants you to use.

For example, the Dell Optiplex Micro isn't on the list of supported hardware.  Will it ever be supported?

How about the industrial form factors?  It is restricted to just that one SKU that Dell produces?

It may be great, as long as the HW SKU offerings are exactly what you need...","",""

MQTT 5 with aliases could improve this, especially since the topic names in this test are relatively long - I used the topic tree from the ProveIt factory to have a real-world scenario - obfuscated (like Enterprise/UhiJiX/XsS/XVQhYa/VvAS/rUtziUBNSVTrkuyBv), but with the same topic levels and length. Interestingly, I have not yet seen that any of the tested brokers uses aliases when sending data to a subscribed client. While publishing with aliases works, either a) no broker has implemented it for subscriptions, or b) I’m doing something wrong.
Implementation could be challenging: for each connected client, the broker would need to maintain a mapping table, assign numbers to topics, and, when the max alias number is reached, decide whether to send the full topic name or reuse an existing number for a new topic. In theory, the broker would need to keep statistics to determine which topics benefit most from aliases and which do not.

I gave up on this some time aho, thought, if some people prefers to beleive some allegebly ""peer reviewed tests""  without  any critical thinking and checking by themselves, let them be mislead.

I think ProveIt has good opportunity really to show, what bandwidth is used by plain MQTT and OPC UA, using reproducible methodolgy, and reviewed by interested participants.

Also, I would adk Zack to share, how they come-up to the conclusion that cloud traffic was too large and causing costs go up just  due to OPC UA communication.

Some of them have had minor updates within recent years. Or, the legacy installation base is still being supported with patches and service contracts.

Infor LN (ex-Baan) is x86 architecture, but quite a few of the other acquired solutions in Infor's portfolio run on iSeries such as XA (ex-MAPICS), LX (ex-BPCS), and System21. As recent as ~2019, I was encountering steel and automotive suppliers running these systems and would need to integrate with them. Most were in the long process of migrating off of them. Occasionally, I would encounter automotive OEMs with a random one-off mainframe apps. Stellantis still manages logistics of its dunnage/containers with some ancient app like this.

The previous generation of Oracle JDE, JD Edwards World, is still technically supported and running on IBM iSeries.

Apparently, IBM still have some business units for supporting this infrastructure. I would imagine some of the banks and transportation companies still have some crazy backend systems that depend on it. AWS RDS added IBM DB2 support last year.

This might be a little forward, and I hope it’s not sales-ee. We put together an AI agent survey tool that we have been using for DTMA and user engagements and I wanted to use it here at the conference to get a sense of what problems people were having and where they wanted things to go in the future. No obligation but if you could try it out we would really appreciate it. It is voice based and has different questions for end users, integrators, and vendors. 

If you want to know the questions or want to see the data collected shoot me a DM.

We may have put it on, but it's because of all of the attendees, who are out there trying to solve real world problems in their facilities, and the vendors, who are trying to help by being the solution to the problem, that made this possible.

Without all of the people who came to watch the vendors be put to the test with the solutions they built against real world data, this wouldn't have been possible. Without the vendors, willing to take the risk and do something like this, this conference wouldn't have been possible. This conference isn't us, it's this community, and we are beaming with pride.

Obviously not all solutions and presentations were equal, but besides the one everyone did great and participated. Of course, anyone can take a step back, go through what everyone did, and determine:
1.) Who gets it vs who doesn't get it
2.) Who actually works with the end-user, and who typically works through an integrator or some other partner.

I didn't get to catch most of the sessions due to running (though I did pop my head in for most of the presentations), but from what I've heard from all of the attendees (and LinkedIn) everyone did great.

It was BEET. Their platform is built around cycle time analysis at a very granular level. When I was at Dana we used their solution on a line we had during commissioning and startup. It requires a significant amount of PLC logic because it captures the millisecond cycle time of every step of an operation. Things like valves firing, movements, pallet stops, etc. 

David, who was the presenter, is the CTO of the company. I think he saw an opportunity to sponsor something and didn’t realize the type of conference this was, and maybe his business lead hung him out to dry a bit there.

A program that is architected, designed, documented, and written well should not take more than a few minutes to extend for applications like this. 

But that conveniently ignores brownfield and thousands of engineers that I can not reach with that message. 

From there, on BEETs side of things, how can they get the raw data and contextualize it in their software? Or work with a partner who can? Rather than relying on the actual event could there be a logic engine that takes the raw event, even from the IO points and derives the events that matter to the use case?

Basically, how can they move the reliance of editing PLC code into their platform?

Maybe this is where the UNS comes in?

I know of some end users who can't touch the PLC logic without voiding the warranty of their new OEM equipment - equipment that already barely works... So editing the code is a non starter for them. 

Once the video is up I am curious to re-watch it with this lense and hopefully have some better feedback. Because as @RemusPop said, let's help them do better! I would love to see the redemption next year.","","❤️ (12)"

I also know that there is a desire next year to show larger systems that can scale.

I also know that vendors were turned away due to availability. 



@Joshua Stover thoughts on having multiple tracks for vendors next year that they can apply for when they submit sponsorship? 

Track A -- PoC -- X Slots available
Vendor must convince the conference committee that they have sufficient understanding of the infrastructure interfaces to integrate and demonstrate value.  While the broad infrastructure will be known, the exact data and possible problems will be unknown until 16-weeks before the conference. 

Track B -- Scalable Solutions -- Y slots available
Infrastructure and data are made available well ahead of the conference. Sponsors apply demonstrating the value they already bring to the existing data, but propose how they would demonstrate scaling or the solution.



A vendor could choose to ProveIt on one or both tracks (for extra street cred!)?","","👍 (4)"

One thing I was thinking about is if End users come next year who are starting their Journey, but if the sessions are based on larger systems and scaling will they struggle.

But if the focus is on the start of that journey and the POC will those who were inspired this year and have done their first phases still want to come.

I was thinking of a European event and what might work and would Day 1 focused on the start of the journey from the desire to change to the PoC 

Day 2 from PoC to the full Digital Plant

Day 3 from Digital Plant to Digital Enterprise.

I do think there is a lot of value from end user presentations. Most conferences I’ve been to have a mixture of end users presentations talking about how they are using various vendors and what types of problems they are solving and how they think about them, in addition to vendor demos.

I think if I had any feedback for next year (because honestly the whole conference was awesome) that would be my suggestion is to have different tracks and maybe one of the tracks is mostly end user presentations.","","❤️ (4)"

But what I think they didn't answer was the level of openness towards other software. And they didn't want to answer that because they always turned it to their own modules and software. One example is reporting (AVEVA Reports is based on Dream Reports, not changed in a long time, and I know that their reporting module is crap).

Google showed some great AI, LLM, and BI tools that I don't think people appreciated as well as they really should have... They also told the room it would cost $2,500 a month ... if I remember correctly... So that made a lot of people tune them out. 

That, and their performance on stage was a bit too corporate for the setting. At least in my opinion.

All in, from what I saw the audience heard was that Google does a lot of great stuff but Snowflake is good enough and cheaper. 

Not saying that's true or not, but I think it's the takeaway that a lot of people left with. 

Partially because of how well @RemusPop did with their presentation. 

Google, along with a few others really felt like they prioritized the top 10% of attendees and were perfectly fine ignoring the rest.

Not that that's a bad thing, they are an enterprise solution, so focusing on the small percentage of advanced enterprise attendees was probably smart.","","🔥 (2)"

And no guidance is 100% accurate but my summary idea is

Most companies need to connect the OT layers first. HighByte is great for connecting L3 systems, LIMS MES CMMS etc. if that is the starting point and I have been in companies that have an enterprise wide SCADA and all the PLC's are connected. Then they are ready for highByte. 
That a good year of work for a lot of companies to get there

And maybe if you start using Ignition to connect at L3 that is a clear sign to look at HB

But sometimes it is better to build something say Node red  Mosquito Timebase Tulip.

And if you build that right. And find you need to look at Ignition to scale to the next 50 machines. Don't worry about the cost or technical debt associated with the Node red.

Same idea if you build a plant system on an Ignition Hive Snowflake and need to scale to 50 plants so want to use Litmus and HighByte same thing.

You've banked loads of savings and learning on the OG stack.

A good architecture makes that upgrade simple.","","👍 (2)"

They simply collected a bunch of telemetry data with low usability for anyone outside that domain.

The best thing to avoid technical debt is to have some data consumers and use cases identified. It does mean that an architecture has to be ""locked in"" to those use cases. The point of Industrial DataOps is that it decouples nodes and reduces the cost of iterating as close to zero as possible.

A modular monolith is still a monolith because all modules are still contained within a single process (the unit of deployment).

For example, i think we could all agree pick-your-erp is a monolith. why? because in order to deploy it you need to structure your reality within a defined framework, and every element of the framework must be filled in before you can fire it up. i can't place orders without products, can't release them without a routing, and down the rabbit hole until youve (inaccurately) mapped your world into another system's world view.

I've also built applications in Tulip and other systems that operate similarly, i have to feed the system my reality into conform to the way the system needs to operate it. smaller pieces than an erp, but smells like a monolith. why? probably because I've limited the user into conforming into my view of the world, mandating they understand the concepts ive come up with.

But then i've built applications in Tulip, which has the potential to be operated in a highly composable way (and is how we recommend using it), where i allow users to create and solve problems and create their world view.. this works well for small scoped problems.  once you connect the solutions together you have higher orders of logic or standards that start smelling like a monolith.... now you can abstract that logic into other end user categories (like solution architects) but then, is the end user making the highly-composable app just operating in a monolith? and... to the architect, are they operating in a composable system nested within another monolith (for example, you could argue the tulip platofrm itself is a monolith at a certain level).

so it makes me wonder if composable / monolithic is defined by the scope of the persona engaging int he developmen","",""

To @Will Sobel  point, this is why building fully axiomized ontologies is a pain, becuase we have to get to a very granular level of objective truth which is just really tedious and hard to do. I was only bringing it up to understand the perspective the article was using. To your point, top down doesn't work, just like bottom up doesn't work. Architectures need to be top down, bottom up, inside out, and outside in. To do that we need a few different types of mechanism (inheritance, composability, etc). 

I absolutely agree that its context based as well. You see the same thing with system design. A system is a subsystem to another system. all depends at what level your perspective is at imho. And that was the point I was trying to make, is you absolutelly can have monolths that are composed, thats the whole idea of modular monoliths in SWE.

The same solution that can serve all industries, in all modalities, in all scenarios, with any equipment, and for all operators. They have to be implemented top-down with a lengthy implementation process that maps out all the requirements, scenarios and contingencies upfront. They require the adaptation of existing operational processes to what the system can support and in the way that it supports it. They provide standardized rigid hierarchical structures for representing manufacturing operations with a standard data model in a one-size fits all approach.  Monolithic systems are also designed for maintainability, meaning that they try to optimize to ease the maintenance and management of the solution by a team with specialized skillsets.

That being said, and maybe this is part of @John Weber  point, distributed architectures can lend to some interesting rollout methods that are hard or not possible with monoliths, things like blue/green, canary, etc. I think in many ways microservice architecture was a shift in architecture design patterns because of humans aka we couldn’t figure out how to sync release cycles, teams being structured by IPT instead of functional home rooms, etc.
 
I agree though, everyone likes to go straight to MSA because they think they need hyper scale, and they thing monoliths are some legacy bad approach. In many ways monoliths are actually are more agile especially when your business logic is still being discovered. That’s one of the reasons startups fail. They moved to distributed to soon, and it adds a lot of inertia anytime they need to refactor. Imho modular monoliths are in most cases going to be the best approaches for the majority of use cases.","","👍 (1)"

My point was for many small companies starting on their journey 
FlowFuse managing some node red nodes on a few edge devices publishing to a central broker, a Timebase historian with some Grafana screens gives massive value.

If after 3 Sprints it's time to upgrade to Ignition or Ignition Edge. To scale to another 20 machines. Well given that
1. I'm already providing value
2. I have identified the data I need in the PLC
3. I have Node red flows to change to ignition scripts 
4. I don't need to change the broker or the Grafana.

The lost costs are minimal.
If I need to Upgrade the Broker that's not a major pain.

The Historian a bit more work as the connects from visualisation probably needs work.

And when I arrive with HighByte I plug into the broker( or use the HB one)

Lots of places can pay 50knfor some digitalisation. If they need to spend 100k that might scare them way.

These some overlap with the OPC UA Information Models (e.g., VDMA's UA for Machinery). They can be coexist in a CESMII Smart Manufacturing Profile. The model definitions are in the CESMII / UA Cloud Library repo.

""Templates"" are a Sparkplug construct. It's basically a way of defining complex data types. It's a way for a Sparkplug consumer to understand what is the full ""shape"" of a complex data type at initial publish before subsequent publishes of value changes. Because Sparkplug publishers are mostly Ignition in practice, templates basically declare UDTs. This is what the MQTT Engine module uses to create UDT and UDT instances within a tag provider.

Inductive Automation's demo at ProveIt imported a CESMII SM Profile as a UDT definition. Travis created a Perspective screen and a script to parse the SM Profile. Beyond this, it was the normal Cirrus Link MQTT module functionality. The UDT published out over Sparkplug with the MQTT Transmission module. Another Ignition gateway was subscribed to it with the MQTT Engine module and converted the template into a UDT. The real highlight of the demo, in my opinion, was binding Perspective components to the UDT. The cardinal sin that those involved modeling standards (e.g., OPFC, VDMA, CESMII, AMT) often make is failing to consume the model (in a meaningful way). This demonstrated that a popular application could do something useful with the data. If a consuming node doesn't do something beneficial, it makes the effort of publishing into a standard pointless. Manufacturers with problems to solve are not interested in an academic exercise of parsing standard data structures someone else defined. They don't want to map in and out of standard for the sake of standards. They want to tap in ecosystems, re-use, and not reinvent the wheel.","","🙏 (1),💯 (1)"

Model defintions are importable as JSON structures either programmatically or as files. Up until recently, model definitions could be imported from third party solutions like Azure DTDL (now WoT) and Element Analytics' Element Unify. More commonly, users elect to consume structured data, validate or reshape/remodel, and ""project"" the schema to destination system. Incoming complex data examples include OPC UA Structure Data Types, Sparkplug Templates, AVEVA PI AF Assets, database tables, complex JSON returned in APIs, MTConnect, etc. It can also create ""schema"" in destination systems (e.g., Sparkplug Templates, PI AF Assets, AWS IoT SiteWise, data lake, data warehouse, database, Ignition tag provider). It's also possible to build pipelines to publish values and schema metadata separately (e.g., values in a narrow table, catalog in a wide table). There is flexibility on how to handle data that is not modeled, partially modeled, or already modeled.","","👍 (3)"

With broad strokes my feeling is

On a site with no SCADA or Historian looking to Digitally transform, Ignition is the starting point. I'd start with FrameworX because I prefer it . But 🥔/🥔 

If a site has InTouch already. I would start there. Not sure I'd Aveva Historian can consume directly from a Broker . But you are already connected collecting and storing so Id look at Flow

If you don't need a SCADA, say a manumatic where some stations are complete manual. Tulip is way ahead. And I'd look at the Tulip edge and Opto22 with Node -red to augment at the stations where needed. Managed by Portainer/Flow fuse. Possible ignition Edge on the Opto if needed.

It results in over complexity and bloated messages that puts a large load on the consumers to parse. I would argue if you deviate from a standard you are no longer following a standard, the value of standardization comes from adoption and conforming to the standard. It's just really hard to standardize something that isn't standard in the real world. I do believe its something worth trying to solve though as it will greatly improve interopability if adoption is high.

1) For us to achieve ""rational component profiles"" we need to have a construct of what our domain is aka a conceptual model, I believe this is where lower case ontologies can play a part (not Formal Ontologies like Will was talking about). Using the USB analogy those classes can be created because their is some fundamental concept of what those base classes are aka what purpose does a HumanInterfaceDevice play in the larger context. If we have an conceptual model of the domain (what I call a lower case ontology) then we can start thinking about the mfg domain has a whole and start understanding where we differ from a conceptual point of view to understand where standard data elements and props are appropriate. (in many ways this is what ISA95 did, which I question the output of, but have no doubt they followed the correct methodology to develop the standard). 

2) For the infrastructure, there also needs to be continuous improvement/feedback mechanism. Industry and data are fluid, concepts change or take on new nuance. If no one is monitoring how individuals are implementing the standard to evaluate if things should be refactored, over time it will become irrelevant.","","✅ (1),☑️ (1)"

This is all great stuff, standards, interoperability, plug-and-play -- It's all excellent. I can't wait for a day when I walk into a factory, plug into the infrastructure, and boom, everything is presented to me, well-defined, with standard models, etc...

However, that doesn't change the fact that 95% of the manufacturing world is brownfield. I have to build solutions for my customers today, with what they have in the field today, with the technology available. 

This is why a lot of what we focus on is building digital models of the use cases and not the physical asset. For example, if i want to measure OEE, I build an OEE model. That model (depending on the customer) is what defines how we measure OEE and the variables I need to measure it. I don't care if I'm measure the OEE of a pump, a press, a robot cell, or whatever else I may come across. 

Digital Twin of physical assets is a pipe dream that is talked about at conferences but not a single manufacturing company we've talked to is asking about this from a value perspective.

My struggle with these types of conversations is that they're typically rooted in the theory of why this stuff is so great.

1) Community engagement on building good component Profiles

The Google Cloud session was primarily focused showcasing the Manufacturing Data Engine (MDE) platform that the Google Cloud solutions team has built over the past several years comprised of GCP services such as Pub/Sub, Dataflow, GKE, and BigQuery to deliver a highly scalable platform for Enterprise solutions. 

In collaboration with Walker, we were planning for him to showcase the first 12-16 weeks of the journey to easily pipe data into BigQuery for analytics purposes in his ProveIt session followed by the Google Cloud session to show the next steps to an Enterprise scale approach using MDE. This messaging may have gotten a bit lost as Walker decided to shift his ProveIt session to Thurs so the messaging became a bit disjointed. In the first 12-16 weeks of a project only utilizing BigQuery in a project would result in a cost structure much lower than the $2500 figure that I mentioned and would most likely be in the hundreds of dollars range based on volume of data and query patterns.

When we think about MDE and the $2500 a month cost structure, that is not just looking at the data warehousing cost of BigQuery (or Snowflake) but rather the overall platform cost for message queueing, data ingestion, data transformation, data storage, and analytics. There is foundational infrastructure of MDE that is needed to support the data ingestion scale that it is designed to meet so that's why there is a higher cost.

Additionally, during the session I did want to highlight where Google Cloud could deliver value to organizations for quick wins at low cost. For that I had showcased a demo of the Google Cloud Agent Builder platform to easily create multilingual search applications for rationalizing over complex docs and getting quick answers which can be run for dollars per day.","","👍 (3)"

You also had a fairly uphill battle when it comes to the narrative of 12-16 weeks, most manufacturers I know don't even look at cloud solutions the first year or 3... Even if they should. 

While I still feel like your presentation went over a lot of heads, I would also like to think that it hit home for the attendees that were ready for it. 

For the right use case, that $2500 /month is perfectly acceptable. As you said - there is a lot going on underneath that isn't immediately obvious.","","👍 (2)"

While Google Cloud did decide to deprecate the IoT Core service, it was never a wholesale divestiture from investments in the Manufacturing Industry and in my time here at Google I've only seen the investments grow with the development of the MDE platform and customer experiences such as our membership at MxD in Chicago. When looking at the capabilities that we were delivering in IoT Core in comparison to the partner ecosystem, we didn't have significant differentiation that IoT Core was delivering for customers so the teams decided to deprecate it with a direct drop-in replacement with a partner, Clearblade, among several other partner options for device management.

Now when it comes to organizing data and making use of that data, Google Cloud does believe we have significant capabilities and benefits to help deliver solutions for customers and that's why we have made investments in making use of Manufacturing data via MDE. For the connect and collect components that's where we have actively looked to the partner ecosystem and have strong relationships with Litmus Automation to deliver an end-to-end solution integrating Litmus Edge as Manufacturing Connect Edge (MCe) with MDE. But of course, if there are existing investments in other on-prem infrastructure for connect/collect, as long as the messages can be sent to Pub/Sub, we can integrate and fit into an overall architecture.

Hope that helps.","","👍 (1)"

Related “hot take” from  DoorDash: Microservices are technical debt: https://youtu.be/LcJKxPXYudE

Doordash moved from a monolith to microservices during COVID. Their development team grew so much and so many changes had to be made at the same time, that it was just too many people stepping on each other. Massively increased required deployment planning (release trains) and generally became kind of a nightmare as a bug in one teams code required everyone’s changes to roll back etc.

They really had no choice but to decouple the teams aggressively. They got short-term productivity from MSA,  allowing teams to develop fast without having to bother coordinating with other teams.

DoorDash (Matt) argues they also incurred a debt, because it negatively impacted the productivity of future teams. Example: You want to roll out a new feature and now that requires a change to microservices A, B and C and  suddenly there is all THAT coordination. Very much in line with your points @Zach E  and @RickBullotta   that MSA  increases dependency issues / add complexity (just in different ways than a monolith).

I really like Matt's take because 1)  He focuses on developer productivity as the core deciding factor, 2) points out that monoliths are harder when things need to change often / are made by many people.

Both sound very relatable in a manufacturing environment. The plant environment often changes and you want to deblock operators trying to respond to / solve for  their unique issues. I’m sure there’s a version of a monolith that could handle that, but moving to a composable/MSA-like model is probably easier at least in the short-term. And you pay the piper later 😊

(I do see your point Zach that in a start-up  / smaller scale phase monoliths might actually allow you to be more nimble to change stuff quickly and consistently. Just gets harder with size)","","👍 (1)"

Thanks to people who have already checked it out. 

To be transparent about the tool, here are the questions we used to build up the AI. The interface is dynamic, not forced, so the AI may not ask all the questions and may not ask a question exactly like below. The AI will adapt based on people's responses too. 

General (everyone):
-    Why are they attending the conference
-    What solution, software, technology is the best value at the conference
-    What are your company’s biggest challenges known or perceived in their future?
-    Are you happy with your vendors? Do their products and solutions meet your current future needs? Why/why not. 

End User
-    Are they doing a digital transformation? If not when. If so, how is that going?
-    What are their biggest challenges known or perceived in their future?
-    How will technology, automation, AI change their businesses? 

System Integrator
-    Are you performing digital transformations for customers? If not, why. If so, how are those going?
-    Something about talent attraction/retention. 
-    How are you positioning yourself to stay competitive in the market? 

Vendor
-    Are you offering solutions for digital transformation? If so, what are they? If not, are you making plans to? 
-    How do you engage customers for product feedback and are you getting enough information to meet their future wants and needs? 
-    Want to ask something about where they see customers are headed and how their product offering is positioned to meet customer needs.

If your org does not have experience or competency working with data warehouses, I would recommend taking a step back. Microsoft vs Snowflake vs X is probably not the appropriate question to be asking right now. 

""Because Microsoft"" might be an acceptable answer for undifferentiated workloads that narrow the decision criteria. This is easy for some things like infrastructure where there might be legacy investments, incumbent/migrated licensing, or hiring/staffing/outsourcing reasons. For something like an enterprise data platform, it's more complicated. There will be more time/effort put into it. There is a lot more building involved. Depending on the use cases and problems being solved, the differences between solutions may feel a lot more noticeable.

I would argue Microsoft is probably the least mature in the data warehousing / data lake space. They've done a lot of pivoting in the past ten years or so. The infrastructure and storage services (e.g., Blob, ADLS, ADLS2) were a decent start and Power BI was already well adopted, but everything in between has kind of been a miss. Azure SQL Warehouse, Synapse, and Data Factory were poorly received. Many preferred to run open-source tooling or use third-party commercial offerings or run in other cloud ecosystems altogether (e.g., AWS S3+Redshift, GCP BigQuery). Anecdotally, I saw MS shops have better luck augmenting SQL Server with Alteryx, Tibco, Informatica, etc back then. MS had to partner and go-to-market with Databricks as a stop gap. There were so many disappointments with Synapse that many won't consider leaving Azure Databricks for native MS services again. Others dislike the lack of continuity in product strategy and investment.","",""

Some are concerned about cost. Some are concerned about openness and the Microsoft-specific compute required to accomplish certain tasks. In isolation, the data engineering community seem to find Fabric limiting and less complete, but what they want may not necessarily be what’s best for their org. Almost everyone seems to agree that Databricks, Snowflake, and the open-source tools are more mature solutions.","",""

The first generation would be the legacy database players like Microsoft and Oracle. OLAP schema, columnar storage, and in-memory tech augmented their capabilities as traditional databases. Second generation would be cloud solutions like Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. They really figured out parallel processing and distributed columnar storage. The infrastructure complexity was significantly reduced. Think DBA-friendly without requiring storage specialists. These solutions have evolved to be more flexible/elastic and are still relevant today. Third generation solutions include Snowflake and Databricks. Fabric is a late entrant. It’s a nice vision for MS that complements Power BI and its AI strategy, but it’s a question if they can execute. Through overhauling, BigQuery has caught up. The problem with GCP is they don’t “eat their own dog food” as a company. Their ecosystem, while well thought in some corners, is less complete overall and has gaps in continuity. AWS is more complete and extensible but complex. It's the most builder friendly. Redshift has improved and is now “serverless”, but can take more work to optimize. Snowflake made the data warehouse truly elastic and simple to manage. They designed it from the ground up to run efficiently on commodity services in the public cloud. It’s very SQL focused and is intuitive for teams migrating from a traditional data warehouse. Databricks made Apache Spark and everything around it lot easier to use for enterprise. It is bring-your-own-storage and is little more engineer-friendly than IT-friendly. Earlier in their history, Databricks and Snowflake were complementary. There are some orgs that use both together. Over time, the two solutions are becoming more similar. Databricks has been adding more capabilities to support warehousing workloads. Snowflake has been adding more capabilities for compute and data processing.","",""

Even if you’re a Microsoft shop, you can run solutions like Databricks and Snowflake on Azure. They can be funded with Azure credits. They can run in or peer with your Azure VNet and fit into your security strategy. Even better, the solutions are relatively easy to test out. The best approach would be to gather a list of use cases, datasets, and integrations for testing. Try out Fabric and Snowflake and anything else. Discover where the platforms work best for your team and the problems they need to solve.","",""

We will consider running snowflake on Azure in addition to our MS Fabric F64 tenant.  In addition to MS Fabric, we are also an SAP shop (current ECC not S4 HANA).  On the OT side we are migrating our SAP MII (EOL 2027) MES to Ignition for DataOps / I4.0 initiatives.  Currently we are replacing MII full integrations to SAP ERP, QM MRO, MES with ignition front end.   As expected, we have mature PBI / Fabric semantic analytics models (both Import / direct lake modes) for our SAP centric IT/OT application data (CMMS, QM and MES-OEE) in addition to finance, sales and supply chain IT models.  Again, introducing new application platforms adds learning curve complexity along with justifying to leadership the value of the incremental platform costs (i.e., $30k OPEX Yr IoT Bridge for Snowflake).   I have had some early POC ETO data pipeline success using Fabric Realtime streaming (from data source MQTT Topic), on-premises SQL mirroring / Pipeline CDC copy data) to land OT telemetry data to the Fabric Lake.   My hesitancy for snowflake is it is a data warehouse, and I would have to mirror / replicate data to the lake to unify and short cut to existing semantic models https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform/Open-discussion-Should-all-data-be-available-in-Fabric/m-p/4681621.","",""

If Power BI and Fabric are the center of gravity for your other workloads, then it makes sense to continue using it. Why are you asking about Snowflake then? Is there something that Fabric is not addressing? The thing that most people seem to like about Snowflake is that it's intuitive and the tooling is pretty complete. The UX helps with scaling adoption.

Snowflake is normatively a data warehouse and originated that way, but it can be used like a data lake. Architecturally, it's basically distributed compute on top of distributed columnar object storage. It can be used with external storage (Azure Blob) and its catalog can be exposed to external query engines. It does necessarily require duplicating the data.

As a matter of semantics, I personally would not consider Ignition as DataOps. It's an application platform with integration capabilities. Connectors + Tag Organization + Scripting != DataOps. Those are ad-hoc data transformations to exchange data with SAP.  Integrations? Yes. DataOps? No. DataOps is a collaborative data management practice.

Yeah, if you're concerned about cost and don't need the low latency, consider alternatives to MQTT for ingestion. You pay a premium to use methods that wrap Azure RTI / Event Hubs for ingestion. They require more compute. If your access patterns can tolerate it, you can gain a lot of efficiencies batching the data and loading it in the bulk through storage. Or, you can take hybrid approach of having a few ""hot"" pipelines for use cases that require it and going warm/bulk for everything else. In practice, what local operations build in a SCADA and what line of business users need in an enterprise data platform don't always match up. Business users may not necessarily use all the process control constructs like tags and UDTs and their transitions. They might prefer to see an aggregation of them or just specific events. Optimizing the delivery of the data can do wonders.","",""
