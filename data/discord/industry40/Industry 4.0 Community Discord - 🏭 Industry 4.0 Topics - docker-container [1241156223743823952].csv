It removes so many variables between the desk of the developer and the deployment. Changing versions of software is rediculously easy, so rolling back after an upgrade doesn't go well is always option. The configuration-as-code with immutable containers makes deployment very repeatable, which, again, removes variables and simplifies the process.

We use docker and Portainer to orchestrate our custom applications, which then orchestrate some production systems. We view Portainer as a management of infrastructure. 

Lately, I've been diving deeper into Cybersecurity... looking to use docker to deploy asset inventory software as well as secure remote access software deeper into the OT space.

The biggest needs are to streamline bringing up bare metal into the ecosystem, then streamlining deployment of an application or stack of applications onto that bare metal, then being able to monitor all their health at scale","","üíØ (3)"

Docker's [guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) includes running as rootless if your environment's containers can get away it. But it's also essential that whatever system is actuall executing the Docker daemon is fairly hardened as well.

Lots of container images that I run of popular software (ex: SQL Server) have made strides in not running as root, and running on thin base images really reduces the attack surface of them as well.

While it wouldn't be my first 'value add' for containerized environments, I do think the net-net of containerization is improved security attack surfaces.

I'd say generally it's discouraged from ever running as root and I don't think orchestrators or runtimes are kicking the can on security.

The container is set up in @Dylan DuFresne's docker-compose for his [Time-Based Historian](https://github.com/DMDuFresne/time-based-historian) project and setup like this to avoid port conflicts:

```docker-compose
  # Mosquitto MQTT Broker Service
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:${MOSQUITTO_TAG:-latest}
    hostname: ${MOSQUITTO_HOSTNAME:-mosquitto}
    container_name: ${MOSQUITTO_CONTAINER_NAME:-mosquitto}
    ports:
      - ""${MOSQUITTO_PORT:-1886}:1883""
      - ""${MOSQUITTO_WS_PORT:-9001}:9001""
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - mosquitto-config:/mosquitto/config
      - mosquitto-data:/mosquitto/data
      - mosquitto-log:/mosquitto/log
    networks:
      - iiot-network
```

I connected to the container and ran `mosquitto_passwd -c /mosquitto/config/passwd <username>` to create a user. Then I restarted the container.

However, I still can't connect via MQTT Explorer or with HiveMQ Edge broker mapping. Any ideas?

I'm a bit concerned with the console message that it's starting in 'local only mode'.
