Integration is a client. It does not publish telemetry to the server but rather sends attribute updates. If the OPC-UA server expects the telemetry from the listener, then you can post time series, either. 
The typical incoming request body for OPC-UA contains contentType, data (JSON string), and metadata. 
Once you update an attribute, the corresponding event goes to the Rule engine. There, you can intercept/filter out the message and push it to the Downlink converter to be formatted as required by the OPC server.

1. re. kepware/ignition: tulip can subscribe to (nearly) any opc/ua server - whether that server is in ignition or kepware makes no difference to us. extremely likely you can go direct Ignition >> Tulip
2. re. connectorhost - the only time you'll need a Docker connector host is if you need to get around some kind of firewall - the IP address of the OPC/UA server just needs to be accessible by whatever CH you use. (i.e. If that address is accessible from the web, cloud CH / if not, local CH). 
2.1 note that Edge Devices have their *own* CH built in but can only subscribe to one opc/ua server at a time. might be easier to get one of these than build a Docker setup. 
3. all notes above are the same for an MQTT broker - if you have a broker running somewhere (either on an Edge Device or in the cloud by someone like hiveMQ), you subscribe to it from your Tulip instance in the same way, same CH rules apply.

Probably Siemens OPC UA Server returns its IP address in the GetEndpoints call. You can see what is the endpoint, if you try to add new connection from UA Expert. Click on the + icon in toolbar, and then under Custom Discovery click on the link Double click to add server. After entering endpoint URL (where you will use rout's IP address, with port 4840), try to expand that node. If the call to the sevrer is successful, you shoudl have at least one entry after expansion. It should have endpoint URL, with either doman name, or IP address. If IP address there is the original address of the Siemens PLC, then following attempt to connect to it will fail, because that address is not accessible from network where your UA Expert is running.
I think solution could be reconfigure Siemens PLC to use domain name instead of IP addess, and then configure your DNS to resolve to IP address of the router in factory network. In the network where the PLC is located, you configure DNS to resolve to original IP address.
In our product we added optoin to map domain name or IP address or whole enpoint URL to arbitrary IP address or endpoit URL (including URL with different port number) to resolve such issues. So it can work via port forwarding and from isolated networks like within Docker container.","",""

I bet if you ask Prosys OPC Forge, Matrikon DataBroker, or Softing SIS, they are potentially all different behaviors.

My preference would be that the aggregation broker would select the most rapid subscription request to for through to the device, then on the server end of the aggregation broker, it throttles that same data to each of the consumers.

Handling of requested 200ms and 500ms sampling intervals could also result 200 ms sampling rate, and for the second client could be revised to 600ms. Or requested rates could be revised to 250 and 500 ms. 
Note that the server has no obligation to accept whatever is requested, it can have its own limits and return so called revised value. Anyhow, clients are aware about this possibility, and should expect that the reality can be different than they ask for.
I did check OPC UA Forge from ProsysOPC and UA Gateway from Unified Automation, how they handle such case, capturing packets between them and underlaying server. They both propogate create subscription and monitored item requests to the underlaying server. Only one session is created though. This is not what was my expectation. Probably there are some configuration settings to create only one subscription and one monitored item with the loweset sampling rate. But I cannot find it for now. I will let you know if in fact this behaviour can be optimized.
In order for UA gateway / aggregators to reduce load on the lower level servers, this feature must be implemented in my opinion. This way UA gateway would act similar to MQTT broker, but better - with additional feature to serve data per each client's desires (taking into account sampling rate, deadband, and set of interested variables).","",""

Even in this case there could be a variation - create with the lower level server one connectin for each role, and then map incoming client conenctions according to roles of the user. Or if there are multiple connections with the same user credentials, route them all into single connectoin with the same user credentials.
Similar to this mapping of incoming OPC UA connections depending on user credentials to the OPC Classic DA connections was done in Matrikon OPC UA Wrapper.","",""

Another question in regard to using chain of gateways could be about delay. For example, let say the sampling rate is 5000 ms.  So, at the primary, lowest level UA Server,  the delay between the time point when a value is changed, and the time when it is sampled, can be from 0 to 5000 ms. If values were sampled at gateway servers again, one would think that delay could be accumulated at each layer and could be increasing like a snowball. 
But actually, using fast publishing rates (mush faster than sampling rate), the changes can be propogated to the higher layers without accumulating of that delay comparable to the sampling rate at each level. Instead, additional delay aded by each gateway will be up to the value of publishing interval. So if you set for example publishing interval to 50 ms, additional delay contributed by 2 layears of gateways would be 2 x 50 = 100 ms. Which is much smaller than the original delay up to 5000 ms. Or even comparing to 1000 ms it is negligible.","",""

In my understanding , UNS as it is understood here, has very little weight on the ""standard"" part. Or, at less it is only in a limited scope (within a company). Having no requirement to folow some international standard can be beneficial in some cases, making the product simpler.

In my opinition UNS can be implemented using OPC UA as both a communication protocol and modeling standard.  Instead of MQTT broker, it would have a OPC UA Gateway Server. As mentioned by @jpmoniz above, OPC UA allows combining indepent namespaces into one, eliminating any naming collisions. So, if you use OPC UA Gateway Server, you will have both ""Unified"" and ""Standard"".
You can argue that OPC UA Server Gateways would not scale to support billions of tags. For that, I woudl ask you - how many tags you have in your project? If it is below 500K within future 10 years - why you are worrying about support for billons?

Most OPC UA products on the market are oriented around normalizing PLC memory objects to be consumable by a SCADA.  Yeah, occasionally there may be something bespoke that supports Methods or A&C, but it's rare.

[What are our clients?]
SCADA/HMI, middleware

[What are the servers?]
Protocol gateways, some PLCs, some SCADA/HMI

Suppose our UNS use case involves providing a client with a holistic ""view"" of an asset.  We might want to know the state of the machine, actuator telemetry, the material its processing, the operator, power consumption, etc.   So, in practice, the sources of the data for this use case actually span multiple systems (e.g., PLC, Sensor Gateway, Historian, MES, WMS, Condition Monitoring).  And to acquire data frnom these systems, we may have to support not only multiple protocols (e.g., OPC UA, MQTT, HTTP, SQL, Text Files) but also the processing of different types of data (e.g., Telemetry, Transactional, Historical).  This isn't some academic machine built with grant money at RWTH Aachen, Fraunhofer Institute, VDMA etc.  Most assets don't have a miniature SCADA or MES onboard with all the data available for a single OPC UA Server SDK to abstract from.  They're not that sophisticated.

Short of building custom software, how does an end user or integrator accomplish this?  How can they connect to all these different systems, transform the data, expose it as a OPC UA namespace / model, and do so at scale?  And, more importantly, what is available to consume this after investing in building an interface to serve the data.

I'm not aware of many solutions on the market where, for every asset, users commonly connect to all these different systems and integrate them into an OPC UA Server.  When one connects to OPC UA Servers, they're doing so to consume an abstraction of PLC tags.  They don't use it to abstract, say, inventory or batch data.","","üíØ (1)"

They're generally associated with a well-defined supply around around a major OEM or group of OEMs.  Think contract manufacturing for textiles or electronics.  The suppliers are more like franchise operations that basically provide localized manufacturing capacity for a major buyer.  One could argue that these supply chains produce near-commodities or very short lifecycle products.  Most other manufacturers aggressively differentiate in their products or processes to capture more value. 

I did recently come across some manufactures in the tobacco industry that are starting to have machines with support for the OPC UA Tobacco Machine Communication (TMC) standard.  These are very sophisticated and computerized machines.  It's much more than a reliable mechanical design and a PLC.  However, for the owners of these machines, their challenge is they have nothing to consume the model.  And most of their users think of industrial data like they would with tags / data points in a historian or scada.  They consume individual points, but not the models.  So, it's interesting that even when one has a ""holy grail"" of machine connectivity (e.g., industry standard model, browsable namespace, metadata), their problems don't suddenly become easier to solve.

It's also worth noting that, in most industrial environments, assets will stay around forever.  They'll be modified (""hacked"") to meet production needs at specific plants by specific teams.  Their ownership will change.  They'll be used and abused in any way possible to crank out product faster and cheaper.  They'll spend their life doing anything but adhering to standards.

There‚Äôs just something fundamentally wrong when Rockwell Automation, a founder and board member, only just recently added embedded support for OPC technology in their controllers after nearly 30 years (~15 years for OPC UA).  If a consumer or end user can‚Äôt spec something like ‚Äúmust have OPC UA with VDMA UA for Machinery‚Äù without a vendor not knowing what that is and how deliver it, the standard isn‚Äôt working.  

It doesn‚Äôt matter how many slide decks, webinars, working groups, memorandum of understandings, press releases, booths at trade shows, vendor-bloated model specifications, academic support, government support, etc.  Ultimately, all this outreach and support doesn‚Äôt help if consumers can‚Äôt buy this stuff.  If they can‚Äôt easily adopt it, they‚Äôll think it‚Äôs vaporware.","",""

When determining the preferred component for an RFID controller from Turck, two SKUs were evaluated: (1) Modbus/TCP variant and (2) OPC UA for AutoID variant

Note, that the OPC UA Turck device is the pinnacle of OPC UA ecosystem: it incorporates a companion spec (AutoID)...no vendor specific information model.  Finally!

Then when it comes to implementation, the integrators start wondering if the OPC UA version is any better:
‚úÖ  Standard information model, browsable and intuitive address space
‚ùå  You have to sync it to a time server
‚ùå  You have to manage certificates

The OPC UA version did require additional development to consume the new address structure, and the benefits didn't justify that additional development.  So the preferred component remained the Modbus variant.

OPC UA couldn't even beat out Modbus in this common, super simple use case.  If you can't beat Modbus, mission failed in my opinion.

Fast forward a couple years when post-COVID supply chain chaos is reigning.  Integrators called up Turck about availability of the Modbus variant.  They were out of stock of the Modbus variant with no end in sight, but did have plenty of OPC UA variants on the shelf....","",""

Either explanation is a bad look for the president of OPC Foundation.

In the meantime, I assume Turck Product Management is now scratching their heads thinking: ""We developed OPC UA AutoID and no one is buying them. Why not?  The Foundation said if we build it, they will come....something about chickens and eggs?""

In sparkplug, there is a strict topic path: spBv1.0/<groupID>/verb/<nodeID>. When integrating a producer of data (publisher), that publisher must be configured for what <groupID> to use and what to use for <nodeID>.  So, already, a small amount of customization happening here when integrating a device into the system.

What to use for those fields will be determined by the system it's integrating into: does <groupID> equate to the cell it's in and <nodeID> equate to the name of the machine, etc.  This is all knowledge that is driven by the design of the namespace of the system that already exists...and the publisher must be configured to comply with that namespace.

It would be interesting to modify Sparkplug to have a configurable prefix, where an engineer configures a prefix on both subscriber and publisher to place sparkplug within a larger namespace.  For example, a prefix of ""/enterpriseHierarchy/site5/cellA/spBv1.0"" would configure both the subscriber and publisher to work at /enterpriseHierarchy/site5/cellA/spBv1.0/<groupID>/verb/<nodeID>

I'm leaning towards the topic path will always be custom across the world so standards bodies should give up on standardizing that, but instead focus on a minimum number of fixed/standard topics (such as NDATA, NCMD in Sparkplug and 'status', 'data' or 'metadata' in OPC UA PubSub MQTT) that convey how to use MQTT (Layer 2 in the Data Access model figure below)

Based on my understanding, OPC UA PubSub MQTT allows the ""opcua"" to be a configurable prefix: opcua/json/metadata/<publisher-id>/<group-name>/<writer-name> @Randy Armstrong please chime in here to clarify what parts of the topic path are configurable and which are declared by the standard.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166016891798700133/1204839394771472404/Fig10.png?ex=68df5d60&is=68de0be0&hm=c36b6e9d7b406fda294b153aad8798b1e3fa57a81d3a75c96db182ca4d6dbd52&",""

In the case of browsing an address space when using a broker, the broker protocol should allow this request-reply.  For example, in MQTT, the subscription to the Metadata is the ""request"" with the ""response"" being the returning of retained topics.  I agree that MQTT isn't as simple here, but you'll find multiple threads on this discord talking about needing a more capable consumer-facing interface, such as GraphQL which would allow subscriptions as well as command-response, but still use a broker protocol like MQTT for the publishers since they will always be ON/connected and the overhead of negotiating the subsciptions isn't that costly.","",""

The reality is some of the most advanced machine builders in the world are shipping proven/validated designs with ancient firmware on new hardware.  All greenfield is acually brownfield.  It's frustrating, but it's the reality.  If there do not exist solutions to efficiently adapt to this world to implement the spec, it's just not going to happen.  The buyer will be presented with ""great"" options such as a 50% cost overrun, 18 month deliver delay, or simply not having a machine to buy at all because the vendor has never heard of any of this stuff.

It kills me when people in our industry pretend like this isn't a reality.  It's dishonest to portray a standard as something that end users can simply add to a buying spec.  It trivializes so much.

I was on a call this morning listening to a customer describe how many different ways they've seen their vendors implement, for the few that do, alarming in OPC UA A&C.  The complexity and variation is mind boggling.  This is an example of how a standard can induce more engineering effort rather than less.  It's no wonder there are so few clients to consume this stuff.","","üëç (1)"

This is another ""it depends"" answer. We'd need to dig into the OPC UA server capacity, the client capabilities and the underlying network performance. Basically the overall system design plays a big factor in the ""limit"" of tags that you can leverage in OPCUA before seeing performance problems. I quickly browsed the OPC foundation website and didn't see anything specific to performance testing other than tools that you can use to validate an OPC Server as compliant. 
 
I do know that a lot of the efficiency with large implementations comes down to how subscriptions are handled within tag groupings. 
 
2,000 tags shouldn't cause performance issues IMO.","",""

OPC standards are used in the most demanding, high performance (and very much PC/server-based) scada mes and historian use-cases. @RemusPop has an extreme example but tag loads around 500,000 are typical. OPC DA and OPC Ua do not build in bottlenecks in all but the most extreme scenarios, but the applications that implements the standard may not be well designed or well configured. 

The same is true for MQTT and other purely pub/sub standards. It can be used for high performance data transfer however one can easily overwhelm brokers if the broker is not designed or configured well.","",""

As for appearances of one protocol scaling more than another - I would need to test myself to be sure, but my instinct in that this is more of an opinion driven by product experiences than by differences between the standards themselves.

Several of his former team members at Microsoft reached out to me after they left ‚Äî to give me the inside scoop on Azure IoT ‚Äî they knew it wouldn‚Äôt scale because of OPC and AMQPs verbosity but a certain leader wouldn‚Äôt listen.

I have re-engaged with OPC because the community has asked me to.  Former members of working groups, former Rockwell and Microsoft employees (mostly execs) as well as many of the vendors and end users.  The problems with part 14 can be boiled down to this:  It‚Äôs too connected to core which is too connected to the OLE origination story.  There are many edge cases part 14 isn‚Äôt going to work for (I‚Äôll list some in that post) and the barrier to entry will make the cost too high to implement part 14 over MQTT5.  I fear (and the very slow adoption rate seems to prove this out) that part 14 will end up being just another optional part of the spec no one deems valuable.  Remember ‚Äî in Industry, Kepserver is the brand name for OPC-UA when it comes to perception.  Drivers into hierarchical tags ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a reason for that.

To ask that question you need to decide who is asking. A device vendor selling to many factories with different requirements does not expect their customers to install custom code on their devices.

"382941357699760129","walker.reynolds","2024-04-09T07:42:07.4410000+08:00","@Randy Armstrong  Here is the issue -- Erich knows that the reason Azure IoT changed course was because of my meeting with the former Chief Architect at Microsoft in March of 2022.  I consulted with Microsoft on where they were going wrong.  This meeting was a result of a major Japanese car manufacturer's, who we work with, decision to drop Azure and move to AWS for their cloud infrastructure.  This was because AMQP, like OPC-UA, is too verbose and was not scaling (there is no way people at OPC-F do not know this is a problem).  We worked with Omron to get MQTT5 and Sparkplug onboard their latest PLC offering, in order to scale the architecture in this client's plant of the future.  

Now whether Erich knows that or not is beyond me -- and frankly, I could care.  What I know is that Erich knows exactly dick when it comes to UNS -- other than what he culls from blog posts and ChatGPT.

Clearly, the new Azure IoT architecture came directly from that meeting with the former architect -- right down to the OPC Discovery Server and Broker (E4K).  I did not recommend the Akri Agent and I had nothing to do with the  analytics plug in.   He left Microsoft in 2023 -- while the new stack was in development but before the new Azure IoT was released.  

The fact is, Erich has no idea what UNS is or how to build one.  How do I know?  Because in the last two years, I have been hired by three different large multi-nationals, one being a major supplier to Tesla, to peer review Accenture, Microsoft and their proposed reference architecture for IIoT.  In all three cases, the multinationals trialed and then dropped Azure IoT and digital twin based on our evaluation and predictions.  Erich must be fully aware of who these companies are.  Honestly -- it was as easy as pointing to the middle of the reference architecture and asking -- 'how will you reconcile the namespaces from this side (OT) with this side (IT Cloud)?'  I then simply outlined for the clients what they would experience and when -- at 90 days x, at 6 months y, at 12 - 18 months z (critical mass).  Once our predictions came true -- they were out.  

About UNS...

I built the first UNS from 2003 - 2005, using DDE, in a salt mine in upstate NY.  I did a second DDE implementation in printing in 2007 and then trialed OPC-DA and then UA from 2008 - 2013 in steel and then tier 1 automative. I then pivoted to MQTT, AMQP and DNP3 in 2013 - 2015.  Why? Because of all the gaps in OPC implementations.  

All along the way there have been those who have objected on various grounds... and in every single case they were either fired or they came to see the light.  It is clear that you are in the latter camp because what you are saying in this thread (especially your acknowledgment that OPC-UA should remain on the OT side and that infrastructure should be self aware -- plug in the PLC and stream up into infrastructure) is a completely different message than what has been propagated by OPC-F leadership.

I can be a dick -- full stop.  But it is alway calculated and it eventually works -- this conversation, which will drive real change at OPC-F, is evidence of its efficacy.  OPC-F has major problems and there are major issues with adoption of OPC-UA, including part 14.  We have folks in this community with exceptional soft skills -- I am not one of them.  I have companies to run -- but the community has asked me to fight this fight -- and I am answering the call.  I applaud your engagement and your character.  I really think we can execute for manufacturers, together.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (2)"

"794020366536146977","mparris","2024-04-10T01:31:31.2050000+08:00","I've been fascinated that MQTT by design/default has a globally accessible address space (name space).  It's the equivalent of a PLC using global registers and having those exposed to the business.

While the MQTT standard is focused on the protocol (connection between a client and a broker), an improvement would be to take a more wholistic view and levy requirements that apply to a broker using the protocol.

For Example, it should be standard practice to reserve a topic space for each client (use the clientID name as a prefix for the topic path?) so they can publish without any concern that they will be stepped on.  Having isolated namespaces opens up the ability to manage request/response, since clients could know who sent the request and reply back in a ""deterministic"" way that appears more like point-to-point

Another example, an MQTT broker prevents one client to publish to another client's namespace.

A third example: A client could read data from another client if an ACL exists, but the topic path will include a prefix of the clientID so you know where it came from. (the client could include in its logic a wildcard to ignore the clientID in the topic path and listen to all messages no matter the publisher)

I understand this is a whole level of complexity that MQTT today does not afford.  But it DOES seem bizarre that it starts with a globally-accessible namespace with no scalable way to restrict that access.

Also, I love how we are discussing MQTT under the OPC UA channel ü§£","","ü§∑ (1),üòÜ (4),ismile (1),üôè (1)"

OPC Foundation has an anchor around their ankles dating back to 1996 (first release of OPC) in terms of how they view integration of systems. For them, where they come from has colored their vision on where it SHOULD go.

It's bizarre that on the front page of the OPC Foundation, there isn't a huge diagram showing THIS IS A UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE.

Here's how it applies:

Rabbit (MQTT): Fast and lightweight, just like the rabbit who could zip around quickly. MQTT excels at speedy message delivery, making it ideal for real-time scenarios where occasional data loss isn't critical.
Tortoise (AMQP): Steady and reliable, mirroring the tortoise's slow but persistent win in the race. AMQP prioritizes guaranteed delivery and error checking, ensuring messages get through even if things get slow.
It's a great way to remember the core strengths of each protocol:

MQTT for speed and efficiency
AMQP for reliability and robustness","","üíØ (2)"

Stephan Hoppe talks a lot about OPC UA defining lego blocks, but my biggest criticism has been that the focus of lego blocks has been too small: standardize on narrow and specific functions to be pieced together however any organization wants.

Before even before talking about the small lego blocks, shouldn't the working groups be given an overall blueprint or playbook from the Foundation as a whole on what should be done in the first place?
For Example: Device Gateway -> Aggregator -> DataOps (information modeling) -> Consumer

OPC-UA is not the future of IIoT and it is not an IIoT protocol.  Those were my original claims and that is what my claims are today.  Nothing has changed... OPC-F is bought and paid for by Microsoft, Beckhoff et al.  It does little to enable interoperability without building edge gateways for protocol conversion.  It is a strong OT protocol and has a place on the edge -- and even there it has very low adoption.  These are facts -- these are not silly talking points.

When I'm done with this next series of videos -- that will compare and contrast up to 30 different OPC-UA products with and against an open architecture built on a common IIoT protocol -- it should be very clear what the objections are.

OPC-F has a leadership and culture problem.  OPC-UA has technical limitations (you call it chatty, I call it verbose) and an adoption problem -- which is likely a result of device manufacturers saying OPC-UA isn't worth it (Stefan calls these OEMs, stupid).

You see the problem here?  It is hubris, corruption, politics and consensus culture that has resulted in OPC-F losing their way.  The best ideas must win -- not the most popular ideas or the ideas pushed by those with the most influence -- the best ideas.

OPC UA DA was developed 20 years ago. The spec therefore only includes required functions for the narrow viewpoint as it was understood back then.

Given the market will only do the bare minimum to check the box, OPC UA DA will continue to only be relevant in the narrow use case that was conceived 20 years ago.

So now one year later you might ask what has changed on the subject!? Umati‚Äôs backbone (the UMATI-DataHub) has been refactored from a custom JSON format to PubSub JSON over MQTT! (thanks to the implementation into the open source sdk)

Problem statement
The use of OPC UA in mechanical and plant engineering is currently cautious. One of the reasons identified is that the necessary specialist knowledge is difficult to develop, especially for small and medium-sized companies. There is a lack of digital support for information modeling, finding existing standards and qualitative assessment of models.

Objective/Results
The CLOU research project aims to develop digital tools that support the modeling process. The aim is to support the discovery and reuse of existing standards through a semantic search. Furthermore, errors and bad practices should be pointed out directly when creating models through linting. In addition, the development of a metric enables the quality assessment of OPC UA information models. The entire development process of these software modules is supported and monitored by OPC UA experts in a project-accompanying committee.","",""

not sure if it a case of lots of violent agreeing.

I mentally split OPC-UA into two bits, the core Spec that covers the transport of data, and in that way I but it in with a basket of protocols, Modbus, Profinet, MQTT, and even HTTP API . They are a way of transferring data from one node to another, with a given set of rules. and overall I want to see movement to having OPC-UA replace ProfiNet and Ethernet IP and TwinCat etc, and make it much easier for Field devices talk to each other.

Then there are companions specs which define how to model and communicate with given types of nodes. but in that case do I not need to know that that node is using that companion spec.
I have seen products say, they are OPC-UA, but never quote a companion spec. Or setting up Kepware to talk to an OPC device, I am not asked to specify the companion spec.

So I can se really great use case in theory if all my motors are complaint to the OPC UA for Devices companion spec and  I know what information is available. But I have never seen that in practice.
Maybe lots of people are but when I go to the OPC website and look under products, should I not be able to filter by companion spec. Maybe that all gets handled automatically for me in a plug and play way, but I don't think so 

and to be honest I am not going to go and read the specs, I open this page https://reference.opcfoundation.org/ get whelmed by the list go make coffee and do something more useful. And I used to work with EU directive and read them back and forth. I even sat down with the list of standards harmonised to the machinery directive and red them one by one. ( some of that is the interface for OPC standards)

so really , and I think I am a reasonably forward looking OT Architect, I just sort of imagine that the companion specs don't exist.
So can I ask, as an Engineer building OT/IoT system what am I supposed to do with companion specs?","",""

Maybe you agree with this: 
it‚Äôs easier to point a consumer to a OPC UA Server which understands for example the OPC for Machinery hierarchy (Walker does literally the same thing with his functional namespaces in the ISA95 UNS), so he will be able to investigate the Machines-Folder, finds all instances of Machines, can identify each individual machine, find all relevant ProcessValues, gets his MachineState and OperationMode (you could use that for calc. OEE)
and then you will be able to reuse that OPC UA Client (Consumer) to Plug in any other Machine from a different Vendor and it still works you can swap them out and the machine contains all that in itself.
Just by implementing a OPC for Machinery or a CS which leverages their harmonized types, you can just create an alias for the new spec. and tell your Client to treat it as an OPC for Machinery Server.

There is a story about a german Company ‚ÄúMiele‚Äù (kind of well known!) which told every supplier use opc ua or your out, they did it! They forced their suppliers to implement it! They even refactored a existing production line!

I know there is often a concept of opc ua in every little device (which can work like a charm) but it needs infrastructure like a opcua aggregation server, small devices like QR-Readers haver very limited resources according to the profile ‚ÄúNano Embedded Device 2017‚Äù. In order to utilize the full potential, you need some modelling on the aggregation layer so you can inplace clone the cs model instance of that reader already linked read/write/browse/call but with much better performance in the sense of hardware (in that point it has similarities with an MQTT-Bridge).
In my opinion in Brownfields that‚Äôs harder to tackle‚Ä¶ it depends on which layer you start adding context thru a companion spec.
I am not sure if you can buy a valve with opc ua build not sure if it makes sense tbh but if someone says ‚Äúvalve‚Äù I am thinking on Festo‚Äôs 5/2 pneumatic valves ^^
It‚Äôs a differentiation between hardware/mechanical stuff and software maybe the valve / motor gets controlled by a plc so the valve / motor itself might be ProfiNet, but the Instance of the model is present in a standardized way within opc ua server which could be the one in the plc or a aggregation server

I mean the whole addressspace model is build around:

For brown fiiled projects our oBox Suite can be a good choice.  It includes Takebishi (our partner) DeviceGateway to connect to almost any existing industrial data source, and convert it to OPC UA. Then with the another component, OPC UA Forge from our partner  Prosys, you can design/model and convert flat data into UNS, using OPC UA companion specifications as a data type definitions.  From there data can be published using OPC UA Pub/Sub. If you want plain MQTT, then our ogamma Visual Logger for OPC is easy to use and quick to configure: it can discover address space, and map OPC UA browse path into MQTT topics in seconds. If you wish you can forward data to Kafka or InfluxDB or SQL database too.

Lol -- we are talking about innovation here, not continuous improvement -- just like Germany got Industry 4.0 wrong in 2013, they are wrong here.  It fails to acknowledge very important points.

1. All manufacturers are different -- while the workflow is generally the same, (CRM -> ERP -> MES -> SCADA -> PLC/HMI -> WMS -> Shipping -> AR/AP -> Repeat) what is on the plant floor is a function of each manufacturers problems over time.  Often times, what we need to standardize isn't clear until we are much further into our journey (not in the beginning when we are just trying to solve the business problem right in front of us).  I was a product manager and process engineer in Tier 1 Automotive, at my last stop before moving into consulting.  I was tasked with both spec'ing, designing and leading the builds of punch presses, heat treat processes and pin/cut machines -- as well as supporting this equipment all over the world.  We were, in effect, our own OEM but not in the typical sense of vertical integration.  I abstracted out a UNS infrastructure -- rather than spec-ing in the tech required because I have been doing this long enough to know that the decisions that are made during the build have to do with function, CAPx and TCO -- and nothing else.  

2. The U.S. will never mandate, by law or edict, a single standard for process data.  Why?  Because our economy is built on innovation -- not planning.  The tech that will win in the U.S. is tech that is open, safe and with very low barrier to entry (it has to be easier to implement it than not to implement it) for integration into common infrastructure.  

My team and I had lunch yesterday with a Sr. Executive of a Edge Device OEM (including PLCs) that has been in business 50 years.  This lunch was after my exchange with @Randy Armstrong and before my meet.  We talked about many things -- Schneider's new MQTT patent for MQTT over SPb to program PLCs (no, he does not work at Schneider), MQTT Sparkplug, the OPC-UA spec (its history and why it doesnt get adopted), part 14, their new offerings in hardware and firmware -- etc etc.  

I took many things away from this conversation -- but two really stood out.  

1. The big players in our industry have done some really fucked up things when it comes to patenting technology post-facto.  That is, claiming IP that is not novel as their own.  He told me several stories about how corrupt the industry has been over his time in it and how his organization has made the decision multiple times to fight it out in court for the benefit of the community at large.  One of the reasons we have only recently started seeing web servers on PLCs that serve out HTML pages -- is because one of the big players patented this use post-facto and then sued anyone who served web pages out of their PLCs without paying them the $900 license for the patent.  That's just one of a million stories like that in our industry.

I've been doing this 25 years -- and I'm still appalled sometimes how deep the corruption actually goes.

One of the reasons I produce digital media is so I can document for the public where industry stands -- and I like to think the only reason one of the major players hasn't tried to patent or trademark UNS and hijack it from the community, is because we documented its origination publicly.

2. He is not a fan of OPC-F and had some stories to tell -- in his words, 'I tried, I really tried with them... but its a [lost cause].'  All of their efforts are focused on MQTT, with and without Sparkplug, HTTP and other tech -- not OPC-UA.  

I am shooting a video today that we'll post this evening where I walk through the conversation, show some demos, ask some questions and express some opinions.  After all this talk -- my positions all still stand.","",""

OPC UA is in the process of a split - on one hand there will be REST + MQTT with JSON/GZIP (Cloud Initiative) and the other will be ClientServer with PubSub over UDP. (UA FX).  Each of these stand on their own but share the architectural foundations. Cloud Initiative has everything that you have been asking for.

Please articulate what you expect to happen given the shifts that are already occurring? No one on any OPC committee believes that client-server has any serious role to play pushing large amounts of data to the cloud. PubSub is the way to go whether it is MQTT or some other broker technology. OPC people understand that pushing data out of the factory requires data formats that understood in the IT space which excludes OPC UA binary.

Now if only the OPC-F had equally competent marketing strategy... 

Your sentiment above is completely contrary (from my observations) from all that is OPC UA. Now is the time to part with the OPC UA brand... even if that is still the underlying tech... and give another go at approaching the market. OPC UA is a bad brand and it will taint anything bearing that name.

Regarding the hydra... You're right. The org  SHOULD evolve but then brand differently. Companies do this all the time. ultimately, the purpose of a brand is to help the customer decide on a product and communicate a message to the market...the name of the brand is not to boost the egos of people in love with the name ""OPC UA"" who want to slap it on EVERYTHING .

The marketing machine continues to prove that they DON'T GET IT.

UA-CLOUD???

If the main focus of that tech is HTTP/REST and MQTT... They are use cases for that tech on-prem with no cloud , which has immediate payback.

we (kepware) released a REST API in 2015 and i for one expected more adoption of HTTP, but that hasn't materialized as much as i thought it would. the lack of standardization across vendors has held it back.

do you have anyone asking you for GraphQL? How about GraphQL Subscriptions?

for me, most of our integrations for process control/mes use cases leverage OPC standards: MES <-OPC-> kepware <-vendorProtocol-> automationDevice.

because we usually terminate OPC UA integrations in Kepware, are typically hosted on PC hardware and use field standards/proprietary protocols for device integration, we see excellent performance from OPC UA and very effective plug-and-play integration with upper-level systems with few of the concerns you mention in your blog post, especially when integrating to long-standing manufacturing software vendors like Inductive Automation, Wonderware, OSI PI, others. some of the newcomers to UA - Amazon, even early implementations at Microsoft - weren't well developed, and certainly running an OPC server on PLC hardware becomes an obvious bottleneck. 

if customers use OPC UA right now on shop floor devices like PLCs i see them doing this selectively for control / light data collection, bumping the UA endpoint up a to an server/PC-hosted application (like Kepware) for high volume acquisition, using proprietary standard from field device to Kepware then UA from Kepware to upper system. that, or MQTT upward :). beckhoff is one exception but they've had UA support for as long as we have (~2009) and typically have more horsepower on their devices given IPC hardware.","",""

3) TLS is encryption only. This prevents intrusion detection software from analyzing the traffic even though there is generally no business case for encrypting traffic within a factory network (vendors of  intrusion detection software often tell factory owners to turn off security for this reason).

OPC-UA is an OT protocol and standard best suited for L1 and L2 integration but is nearly always converted at L3 to an IIoT protocol like MQTT, HTTP, AMQP, DNP3 et al.  It is OLE for Process Control, after all.

Its not either/or, it is AND.

The OPC-F has misled the public about what OPC is and what is is capable of and what is used for.  

These are facts -- and I am happy to support them in any open debate.  

Another fact, the leadership at OPC-F are unwilling to openly debate after multiple public requests -- there's a reason for that and it has nothing to do with the fact that I might hurt their feelings.  The reason they don't engage is because they will get destroyed in a public debate and they know it.

walker can get away with certain inflammatory rhetoric as part of the mountain of attention he's built and his style of conflict theory, forcing attention and conversation about complex issues, but at the end of the day to me and to my customers, UA provides real value to system integration, does have wide adoption across HMI, SCADA, MES and Historians, and integrates more easily and MUCH more securely than its predecessor OPC DA. this work is so full of nuances that i shy away from just about every absolute.

maybe that's just my personal hot take. admittedly i did not pay much attention to attempts to standardize device integrations until recently, whether it was Rockwell's ""Connected Enterprise / EVERYTHING CIP!!!"" or OPC UA Foundation ""UA up and down and everywhere"". all of that immediately went into the ""more marketing"" part of my mind (where EtherCAT, Profinet CBA and a few others hang after they were marketed as end-all be-all for M2M and device to xyz Windows or Linux host.) Not one system I've ever found uses Profinet CBA - it's all isochronus or real-time, too fast for most PC hosts without extra costly stuff.

i hope more hardware vendors follow siemens lead and document tech specs and recommended thresholds. over time for me it's rare to have anything like a note from device vendors of available performance for native protocols - maybe a carryover that these had been primarily programming interfaces and not purely intended for high volume data collection - and having that knowledge as you head into integrations will save untold money/time even as more intentional data publish interfaces become the norm.","",""

Your response mentions interface protocols, which primarily points to Data Access.

OPC UA is Data Access.

OPC UA is Global Discovery Services.
OPC UA is PubSub.
OPC UA is File Transfer.
OPC UA is Device Onboarding.
OPC UA is Asset Management.
OPC UA is Cloud Library.
OPC UA is Field Level Communications.
OPC UA is over 30 Domain-specific information models.

My guess is that Matter will have greater success since the use case is very clear: standardize the connectivity from any sensor to a consuming/controlling platforms.  In this market, there are only a handful of consumers and the expectation is that all of these platforms will support it (Amazon Alexa, Google Nest, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple HomeKit).  I was not aware of Matter and Thread, so I'm only speculating without having dug into it myself.

Likewise, with the development of USB, there was a handful of vendors on the ""consuming"" side of the equation (Microsoft Windows on top of IBM, NEC, and Compaq PCs).  Those companies made the USB standard happen with a clear use case, and it took off in the market from there. (read more here for my thoughts on that https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/opc-ua-vaporware-matthew-parris/)

In the Industrial Data Access space, there isn't an easy monopoly of information consumers to bring a standard to the market, as was the case with USB in the late 1990s and Smart Home platforms.  But, I can at least say that Ignition demonstrated its ability to bring a protocol such as Sparkplug from obscurity to the market.  That playbook should be followed with any new tech standard.

With any technology that OPC-F releases,  I first try to identify the consummate information-consumer for that standard.  If it were my choice, I would block public marketing and publishing of any tech standard until there is at least one, gold standard producer+consumer pair to demonstrate the technology, preferably an open source solution. (no premature ""Mission Accomplished"" allowed)

 But alas, users are left holding the bag to search/drive the market itself, which is why OPC UA is a stale brand.","",""

¬´Does OPC UA have good adoption?¬ª

As a skeptic when faced with these types of questions, a skeptic will say, lets look at the facts, and what do the fact tell us? 

Before I get to the facts, I‚Äôm going to make a few simplifications. I will limit this to PLCs, as PLCs make up more than 90% of the market in automation. With possibly hundreds of PLC manufacturers, I will also limit this to the top 10-15 OEMs, assuming they cover more than 50% of the total market share, and also will be somewhat of a representative selection of the Industry overall. I will also only look at the products currently available from the OEMs, and so I can do this from the comfort of my sofa, without having to visit a representative selection of plants, we will assume a likely greenfield plant or upgrade plant.

Next lets define what is meant by ¬´good adoption¬ª. Walker has made a suggested definition: ¬´good adoption is the likelyhodd that a majority of devices in a random plant have opc ua onboard in a usable implementation¬ª.

Sum: 12 of the 17 major PLC OEMs have products with opc ua servers embedded on the device. 12/17 > 50%

Next we need to answer, are the implementations useable? Since this is much more tricky to answer with research, I‚Äôm hoping this community has some insights. What are your experiences with the above OEMs devices‚Äô OPC UA servers??

I think an important question is are Machine builders using it and are End users using it.
Of course PLC vendors need to add it to the PLC, but then it need to be used for it to be successful.
And once it make life appreciable easier for end users they will migrate.

I was Global Automation Lead, for 8 concentrated beverage plants, and 99.9% of connections to PLC's were not using in.
Some of that is of course because of legacy.

The only implementation I saw it used was for a Packing scanning line that was Kepware->OPC->Custom Application. And that time included a complete upgrade of the Automation system in one plant, All PLC's upgraded, and the control changed from pushbutton control for valves and motors. All native drivers used, and noone even suggested if we should use OPC.

OPC UA is a good *architecture* and tackles many things we need (or already do) in the field on many different levels. Sometimes it is hard to understand what is meant in the text, but most of the time I hadn't a problem with that.
Nobody ever needs 100% of that (like nobody ever needed (or had) 100% of the ModbusTCP spec) and nor will every device be able to support 100% of it (because it doesn't need to).

It's purpose is not to replace protocols (in some cases it could with a bit more code around which might be even a better solution and yes I am looking at you again Modbus!!11! :^)  ) and not replacing any SAP or other systems, it provides the idea of a unification of information about your system, what it contains and how to deal with it.
And it is way more than just handling communication between two or more devices. It is not a protocol converter. It is still an architecture. It depends on the programmer how he uses this idea.

Shall we provide OPC UA to everything now? No. Not everything can (or should) be solved with a hammer if your problem is a screw.","","üíØ (2)"

Instruments/sensors <-> Controllers
Controllers <-> Edge Apps (SCADA, HMI, Historians, AI/ML applications, MES) 
Edge Apps <-> Edge Apps
Edge Apps <-> Cloud Apps
Cloud Apps <-> Cloud Apps

Each level should support discoverability and metadata, a type system and model system, and should support data and events (and probably functions/methods).  As we move up the stack we should support a generic pattern for discovering, querying, and storing historical data/time series data.  All levels should support polling/on-demand reads, on-demand writes, on-demand function invocation, and subscriptions for reads (with or without RBE).  

The system should support providers and consumers in a wide array of programming languages and should include bridges to other popular protocols.  It should support multiple transports (TCP, UDP, WebSockets, etc), and multiple encodings (binary and JSON at a minimum), and designed for extensibility of both transports and encodings.  Much of this should be abstracted away by the SDKs, and mixed mode should be supported (binary on the wire, JSON to the consumer).

The modeling constructions should be in a modern data format such as JSON-LD (not XML) and should support modeling not only assets and their data/functions, but also the relationships between those elements.  Also, standalone and reusable schemas as well as composable ""interfaces""  should be supported.  Identifiers should be meaningful, readable, and unique within a defined domain (e.g. URIs).

I came from a PLC world where only data values existed, and descriptions of what things represent are either in Docs or in the names or as a comment anywhere. It's flat. This is not a bad thing, it just is as it is.

Now there is the possibility of an object. It can contains Variables, Methods, even Events and Alarms and References to and from other Objects. So it is able to show me an information model how things depend on each other.

It provides me an Interface to deal with the Object and I don't even need to know how the device even works.

As an example:
If I have a modbus device, I could read my coils, I have to know the address, then maybe have to make some bit magic and I have my value of a temperature sensor (example).
If my Modbus would support OPC UA, there could be an object TemperatureSensor_Oven. This object would contain a method like ""getTemperature()"" and the type of the return Value is clear. It still makes it's modbus stuff under the hood, but provides me the value in a unified way. 


If you say the architecture (https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part1/v105/docs/6 ) looks like a UNS on first sight, I agree. But OPC UA can be more than that. Nobody forces you to have Events, Alarms, History and more.

Refering to internals of an application? No. It's still an architecture (""the blueprint"") which you can use as you like. It refers to internals if you want to implement it! Like an observer pattern can be a nice architecture, but you can just use it if you implement it (and so it refers to internals of your application).

Moving Data from Sensor to Cloud? It can, but it mustn't. See Figure4 from my last post. This is the ""big abstract"" picture. There is nothing written about just  ""pushing data from Sensor to Cloud"". It is more.

If your usecase is ""I want just datapoints to be moved from A to B"" I won't say OPC UA hast to  be your first choice. I guess you may be fine with an UNS.

But if you want to do more like ""I want that all robots shall move to home position"" you could do it via MQTT like ""this is a Value which contains/represents a value that represents a command where robots will move to home position"". But nowhere would be clearly written what this thing does and what return value is to be expected.
 
In OPC UA this would be a method.  A user would just see a method ""move all robots to home position"" with a description, inputs and expected outputs. In the end, this method well implemented will still kick off normal commands to the robots.","",""

If the lines between foundation and vendors were not blurred, one might expect more accountability and meaningful participation.  If one were in leadership, they might inquire ""Hey, guys, what's going on here?  Do you actually believe in this or not?  Why are you marketing membership and involvement but you have made no effort to adopt this in your products?  For this to work, you have put in effort like everyone else.

For me Part 1 and part 3 describe the basics very well, which is mostly enough to understand the bigger picture. Nobody learns and understand 100% of the Profinet Spec overnight as well, you would start with the basics.

The fundamental thing for me is: *OPC UA provides a consistent, integrated AddressSpace and service model. This allows a single Server to integrate data, Alarms and Events, and history into its AddressSpace, and to provide access to them using an integrated set of Services.* This is the design goal.

To under-implemented? I don't let this point count. It sounds like a ""the internet is just a hype-(Bill Gates, 1993) and we shouldn't invest time & effort to implement it in more devices/applications"" -Argument.

OPC UA has potential and is more and more rising. Since when does a S7-1500 support OPC UA? I think it wasn't so many years ago.

One worldview is that the responsibility of the OPC-F is to put words on paper, validate ideas through interoperability workshops, and then evangelize the specification through trade shows. They shall not be accountable whether vendors incorporate within products.

I understand that is how it appears, but (genuine question) can you answer what says it must be this way? Who decided this boundary?

It would be amazing if a PLC could connect to an AutoID device and provide the controls engineer the necessary registers with the data from either a barcode scan or an RFID read.  OPC UA has not shown value over Modbus/TCP here.

It would be amazing if a SCADA solution needing the value of a Remote IO block of Slot 1, Input 5, could connect to any brand remote IO system to get that data.  There is no standard data model for Remote IO.

It would be amazing if a 2-hr-based IIoT platform product could natively consume OPC UA PubSub MQTT and convert into information within that platform.



I have provided positive suggestions/solutions over the past three years regarding the strategy of the OPC Foundation.  Which of these solutions will not positively improve the situation?

Are you suggesting that my effort to bring awareness to foundational concerns regarding the brand of OPC UA is of no value to the OPC Foundation or the community, and that the best way to help the situation is to accept the situation as-is and develop some open-source?

I can see that OPC Router can connect to RFID readers and represent data from them via OPC UA. Probably you can also setup mapping of data from RFID to PLC too. Not neccesarily PLC should connect directly to RFID readers, is it?

In regard to OPC UA PubSub, in ProsysOPC UA Forge the payload format and topics are flixible. If there is IIoT platform which can consume vanilla MQTT messages ( beleive there are, based on popularity of UNS architecture, using MQTT at the ecnter), then probably it can also handle payload published by ProsysOPC Forge.

Is there any reason to not include a standard server in a ""device gateway"", for example? Or for example, an aggregation broker should include  client/server with Reverse Connect, and PubSub. This would so help create standardization in the market and give the community a common lexicon for discussing the technology.

2) it would help the community if there was a landing page showing these higher level profiles placed within an architecture. Then for those wanting to go deeper, show the existing application profiles with a matrix of the meaningful differences between them (what is missing when picking an embedded server profile vs a standard server profile, for example).

There were debates here accusing OPC-F not being open, because in order to sit in work groups you need to pay a membership fee. Which starts from around 3K USD. 
If you add mandatory certification, this will set the bar even higher. I don't know the exact number, but it will cost at least 15K for members, most likely higher if the product does not pass tests fast enough and takes longer than the number of minimum hours included in the basic fee.
You can argue the price is too high when spread among many customers. Perhaps, but first, this would be an up-front cost, the vendor needs to invest before any sales start. Second, it will also delay the first release of the product. And after some time the certificate expires, and when you release a new version of the product, you need to certify again.

I just doubt that proposal to move making a decision from customers to OPC-F (read: mostly members-vendors, not end users) is the best. You think end users are not in position to evaluate and decide themselves, what products to purchase? 
Also, how about open-source projects - who will finance their certification? I know that open62541 was once certified. But since then it has multiple releases, so it is different now than certified version, and that old certificate is not applicabe anymore, right?. Who will take responsibility to certify it again? What should OPC-F do with it now if nobody certifies - ask GitHub to remove it until new certification?

Usually, the issue is that the OPC UA Server is running 1.04 vs the client running on 1.03, because 1.04 changed where custom data types are stored (no longer in DataTypeDictionary). 

The above confirms most of the interoperability pressure with the OPC UA ecosystem resides with the clients....they must account for all the possibilities of servers that are in the wild.  It's a challenge to easily communicate within the market whether a client will be compatible with a server.  Version number compatibility is completely different dimension for interoperability...something the market doesn't even  have on their radar, so it's understandable why can get such a bad reputation.","","üíØ (1)"

To get a product officially listed by the Sparkplug Working group as ""compatible"", it does required Eclipse and Sparkplug Working Group membership.

Speaking of aggregation, sometimes it is essential to use single connection to the underlaying server. If there are many clients connected, with subscriptions at different sampling / publishing rates, it would subscribe at the fastest rate and distribute / publish to clients at rates they request.  I am not sure if Unified Automation Gateway does it or not. 

Prosys OPC UA Forge also another aggregator, but it maps client subscriptions to the subscriptions on underlaying servers.

Another topic is - user identity mapping. If lower level server does not support user / role based access, you might want to implement that  at the aggregating server level. Or maybe in some use cases pass through the same user to the underlaying server. Ideal aggregating server would be flexible and support all these use cases. I am not aware about existence of such aggregating server though.

And lastly, it would be nice not only propagate underlaying server's data types and model. but also have ability to compliment it. Prosys OPC UA Forge has rich enougfh features in this. It can bring data types / instances from lower level servers, and also you can define types / instances and map lower level server variables' attribute to the aggregating server's variable's attributes.

And lastly, probably it might be beneficial to cache lower level server's address space in the aggregating server, so clients still can browse when lower level server is offline.

Those are possible feature the aggregating server coudl support. Not sure if all of them ar eimportant for the end user. Would be interesting to know.","",""

DDE is only suitable for local (same OS) access as Microsoft has dropped support for Network DDE (netDDE) from modern windows versions. 

Security is only as good as preventing access to the windows OS where the DDE client and server are running. 

DDE is also disallowed between user apps and services, so your DDE PLC server has to run in your user session, and this may create more admin work to set up auto starts and then choose the user context to run the server and spreadsheet.

You can be skeptical about companion specifications, and complain about the complexity of designing models, and the lack of applications that are able to interoperate utilizing these complex models. If OPCF work on such companion specifications, there is probably demand for them. But their existence does not reduce the value of the OPC UA in general for a particular end user I believe. If you are not interested in having a coffee machine with a built-in OPC UA server, it does not affect how your applications with OPC UA support operate.

In my opinion, the core of OPC UA: Data Access using subscriptions, History access, and now Pub/Sub over MQTT  is mature enough and provides a good level of interoperability. Our product oBox Suite, consisting of multiple components like microservices, successfully uses  OPC UA as an inter-process communication protocol. And we had only a few interoperability problem cases communicating with customers' OPC UA servers, which usually are resolved in the short term. 
Please also note, that while OPCF's direction can be influenced by the interests of large corporations, there are small companis who truly believe in the value OPC UA provides, and deliver products utilizing the power of OPC UA to the market, such as ProsysOPC, Takebishi, and also One-Way Automation. These small companies are more flexible and are responsive to the customer's demands and care about the end users more than large corporations. Therefore I think end users and integrators should pay more attention to the products they offer. Instead of refusing even to look at it just based on there is an ""OPC UA"" keyword in their description.","",""

But I have found an adversarial approach can lead to feeling of being attacked, and entrenchment, and I think I can see come of that in the larger conversation in relation to OPC.

and I think you certainly have left out options such as, OPC is continually evolving as @Randy Armstrong says, and needs to keep at it.
or ""OPC is 100% perfect and should not develop any more"",  

but regardless of that, I am going to steal from Aaron Sorkin, ""Give me the next ten words. How are we goanna do it? Give me ten after that""
- Do OPC-F need more companion specs or less?
- Do OPC-F need to get rid of some and bring in others.
- Do OPC-F need to enforce testing and certifications? 
   - What is the process, how long will it take, what will it cost?
- Do OPC-F scrap the information model completely?
- if OPC is too verbose, what does it need to be brought down to, i.e. what percentage of a payload should be header?
 - What Technical features are needed for OPC? 
 - What Technical features need to be taken out?

and maybe you can answer those simply, or others here can. 

Because some of the discord on this channel , has become what I would call ""Footballification"" where people are team OPC or team MQTT. And you can sometimes even see the ""balanced position"" of there is good and bad to OPC and MQTT, here are 2 issues with MQTT and here are 1000 issues with OPC ( hyperbole here obviously). as a case in point, you could create the same image for MQTT, surely their lack of adding in methods and queries coudl be claimed the, claiming they don't have a problem and stagnating?","",""

Tom Burke reached out to me through a proxy and said he wanted to come on the podcast and give his take -- that he agrees with many of the community's assessments and believes he has a duty to drive change.  His only fear was that I might blame him for the state of OPC.  I stated to the proxy -- 

'I will not attack Tom.  I do not invite people into my home and then treat them unfairly.  I will ask tough questions but they will be fair.  If anything, I am accused of going too easy on guests in the podcast (SAP is a good example) because I am so focused on being fair to everyone.'

We had a pre-production meeting with Tom and agreed on the topics.  

1. What was the original intent of OPC and OPC Foundation?
2. How has the OPC Foundation lost its way?
3. What should happen going forward?

The 'how has the OPC foundation lost its way' topic came directly from Tom's quote in the pre-production meeting.  Tom said the 'OPC Foundation has lost its way'.

The feedback from the podcast has been glowing -- I made a point to let Tom do most of the talking.  People were there to listen to what he had to say, not what I had to say.

I challenge you to find a single exchange in that podcast where I was adversarial with Tom.

Randy -- this is laughable and you can't possibly be serious.

Tom Burke most definitely is NOT telling OPC people that podcast doesn't represent his views.

The podcast was posted in its entirety and without a single edit.  Watch the entire podcast Randy -- you clearly have not.

Last but not least -- I want the OPC Foundation to succeed -- for manufacturers and for end users.  I am not anti-OPC.  But that doesn't mean I am going stand there while the emperor is driving a bus, naked, off a cliff, and not say something.

1. Does the OPCF have an adoption problem?
2. Does the OPCF have a value proposition problem?
3. Does the OPCF prioritize the needs of end-users when making decisions?
4. Does the OPCF President, Stefan Hoppe, answer to Beckhoff?
5. Does Erich Barnstedt, who chairs half of the working groups, answer to Microsoft?
6. Is the barrier to entry for OPC-UA too high for most use cases and, therefore, suppresses adoption?
7. Has the number of organizations who have left the OPCF since 2020 been higher than the number of orgs who left between 2016 and 2020?

The OPCF does not address the objections from many members of the community (most of whom ask me to push this discussion to give them political cover)... instead, they passive aggressively attack the messenger and state to the world, 'there is no problem'.

I know just how bad things are at OPCF because there are many current members who are sick of the state of things -- and they privately share the details with me.  Thats the advantage of the platform we have built.  And I have a duty to do something good with that platform.

Tom has bigger plans -- he knew the shit storm this would cause -- and kudos to him for weathering it.

But... if OPCF isn't going to listen to Tom, then they aren't going to listen to anyone or anything but competition.  

Next step -- we will have an online petition for people to sign.  It will have a list of claims and we will solicit signatures of support.  That should put the pressure on Stefan to address it directly (he is under a ton of pressure from the board of directors right now).

Erich is on a very short rope as well -- at Microsoft, specifically, and will support reasonable measures.  

Tom outlines what should be done -- focus on process control, adoption and certification.

There is activity now that may drive taking the open sourced OPC IP and refactoring it for quick adoption, easy certification and low barrier to entry -- through a completely new org.

OPCF is betting too heavily on getting OPC-UA written into regulations -- and that could only happen through the EU, which is politically weak right now and getting weaker.  

We will see something for industry based on OPC but without all the noise and with lower barriers to adoption.  OPCF is a rudderless ship and the Burke podcast only revealed just how bad it is.

Hell -- I've been told multiple times from multiple people that @Randy Armstrong agrees with a lot more than he lets on -- but he gets paid from OPCF and must toe the line.  And I've heard that from multiple people who have reached out.

 - This is what happens when you try to use an OPC stack to scale

- This is how the magic happens when you use both together.

It we agree that the view is that ""Walker Reynolds and 4.0 Solutions"" are hostile to OPC-UA, and I would say some what unfairly that is the perception
I can understand why vendors who are solving problems with OPC-UA would not lean in and attend Proove it. and from what I have heard about the Functional Spec, it will be based on connecting to a MQTT infrastructure

As you say quite a few of the Vendors will have OPC servers, and if the solutions extend to Level 1 and 2, I suspect we will see OPC-UA in a lot of solutions in Proove it.

Just to clarify .
- I think you are being very adversarial towards the leadership of OPC-F, and only a little bit Adversarial towards the technology
- I think over the past 18 months you have become less MQTT> OPC and more there is a place for OPC and MQTT in solutions
                      And maybe that is a shift in the tone of the video, rather a than a shift in your views, or maybe a shift in my understanding

This also requires integration and plugins for modern development environments, starting with VSCode (open), then IntelliJ (closed), etc.
2. Community engagement: find a successful open standard and copy that model. For example, Apache software foundation, CNCF, etc. are all gold standards.
3. Create an open and accessible certification process: In addition to documentation, docker native automated tooling that can perform a ""torture test"" on clients and servers that can be run on anything, in an automated fashion to provide a 1.0-alpha level certification level. For example, run the test and get a unique hash of your test results.

I would not judge without knowing details and in the absence of those who created this, that they are stupid. 
Or judge about OPC UA in general just based on this particular instance. 
If you use plain MQTT with JSON payload, you don't have standard way of telling the subscriber what is the data type for example for the numeric value 4 - is it float, integer, signed or not signed. With OPC UA you can let the client know what is the exact type, and for those clients who know what server theay are dealing with and for which it is important, they can get that information. Why just don't leave them along and let them do whatever thay want?  If you are using this server and this is related directly to you, affects your business, then I guess you should ocntact directly this vendor.

oBox Suite is not to solve this problem.
The problem is how you get the data from industrial devices, like Mitsubishi PLC, or some other 20 years old device with proprietary protocol. And then how you present raw data from it in UNS like structure. You can use Kepserver with HighByte to solve it. We offer better alternative - in a single package, which can include industrial PC or only software, which runs in Docker, and can be managed remotely at fleet scale. With support store & forward.

OPC UA solves much more problems than just providing transport. For that reason, there are SDKs to speed up the process.

Publishing data to the client from server (using subsriptions / monitored items, not Pub/Sub) is done in a way that works for slow clients too: if client cannto handle all data reported by the server, the publishing rate will be gradually adjusted.

Browsing is designed to work no matter how large is the address space - results can be returned by portions, like paging.

Methods of course one of the advantages,

You can implement Single Sign On using different authenticatoin mechanizma, etc.

The ""RBE"" feature in OPC UA is implemented keeping in mind that on the server side there will be queue of already received Publish requests, so whenever data is ready, it is sent to the client. This way publishing is done using request-response mechanizm behind the scenes. 
My point is that if the client cannot handle data change notifications coming from the server fast enough, then the queue of requests on the server side becomes empty, and the server does not sent more data until the client handles all data sent before that. Eventually this can cause data loss, but such data loss cases are clearly identifiable, and the client has some control on what value to keep  - oldest or newest.  In other words, the speed of data handling between the server and client is synchronized this way.

In essense, after creating a session, if the client connection is configured to do so, we get type information from the server for all custom types. Standard types are the same for all servers, for that part type info is read from the file. In short, this is XML formatted data,  OPC UA model editors save it as .BSD file, with the root XML element <opc:TypeDictionary>. Then in-memory map is built, where we can get type definition C++ structure by variable's data type node id or type's qualified name. This structure in essence holds information which could be serialized as JSON schema. But as this is in-memory structure, we don't need to serialize as JSON. 
Having all this information, we can store binary encoded custom type values in local storage (for the store and forward feature), and having it in the local cache we don't need connection to the server to serialize/deserialize it. 
And we can also expand the encoded binary value to the C++ class universally representing ny possible complex type values without knowing type information at compile time.

But you can get source if you buy it. All other OPC UA SDK vendors offer the same - binary only distribution and more expensive distribution including source code.
BTW, we can make it open source if community can sponsor the project.

Please also note that having some library as open source, it is not equivalent to owning it. Because usually only core maintainers can decide wither to merge your pull requests or not. So it is like read-only code. But at the same time often open-source project licenses require you to send all your changes to the project. So you might end up having your own fork and regularly merge into it changes from the original repository.

I understand that when you need to buy some software  library, it is not so easy to get approval from management. For some reason companies completely fine when a developer spends few months to produce some code (which might be cost the company around 10K for each month, or 2.5K per week), instead of buying a library for the price equivalent to one week salary of the same developer and complete the work in a few days.","","üëç (1)"

1. RESTful support. e.g. GET https://user:pass@yourcompany.com/OPCUA/SimulationServer { ""nodes"": [""ns=3;i=1008""] } might refer to something like alarmDuration::AlarmRateVariableType of DataType Duration, which could just be { ""alarmDuration"": 300 }.

The other things, like companion specs, can be seen as optional. If I am  a Woodworking company, am I forced to use OPC 40550-1? No. You are free to go, to use your own made Companion Spec Namespace. It won't get an OPCF brand, but so what?:

Is it so different to consume via OPC and then in your data ops layer coalesce from many date sources, the data and info for that asset and publish it back to an OPC server allowing other nodes like Timescale DB to consume that data.

Can you not have an OPC server as your central hub. allowing all the nodes in the Eco System to poll data from any other node?
Or use OPC-UA Pub Sub and 
You certainly lose some flexibility in how you manage your namespace, and are constrained by the devices/node centricity but I don't really see a difference between that and Sparkplug B.

Yes in an OPC approach you normally end up sending data to a PLC that is not really needed so you can consume from that PLC the entire scope of data that you want related to that device, or I did at least, and that does add extra effort and over head, but I would not class OPC UA as being painted into a corner.

And I agree as an architect, I would normally recommend OPC at L1 and L2, and as we move higher strongly recommend to convert to MQTT.
but if a client insisted on using OPCUA at the Enterprise level, I would not walk away and certainly somewhat because I don't have FU money, yet.... but also because I do think you can make a workable architecture using OPC-UA across all levels of the business.","",""

The application has 20,000 UINTs
PLC cycle time = 10ms
Each cycle I shift a pointer and change the value of 200 tags (each cycle is a next group of tags selected by the pointer). Therefore in a monitor interval of 250ms, 5000 of the 20k tags have changed their value.

I did two programs: in the 1st one the UINTs were presented as 20,000 individual tags.
In the 2nd they were packed into 200 Arrays of 100 UINTs each.

Results:
1. It seems that 200 arrays of 100 UINTS fly like a jetplane. The BMENUA0100 regards each array as a single monitored item and updates to a UAExpert client are lightning quick.
2. The application with 20k individual integer tags was still behaving well in within expectations, but not quite as fast as the arrays. But this might have just been my feeling based on how the data is presented in the client UI - with arrays you can see much more of the data at once.

3. The UaExpert client seems to deal with the volume of data and update rates much better than the Kepware OPC Quick Client. The Kepware Quick client does okay with a handful of tags, but really struggles with 20k tags, so it isn't a valid tool for this test.

4. The BMENUA0100 server does seem to top out at 20k  monitored items. Any more and it becomes overloaded, with the diagnostics starting to report overruns.

If anyone is interested in seeing a screen recording of my tests I can upload it.","","ü§ò (1),üî• (2),üëç (1)"

How are you publishing your values?

I have started testing MQTT on a S7-1212 and I find it unbearably clunky.

To be honest after publishing and subscribing to one value, I cannot imagine having the patience to code 500.

I am either going to need one block for each topic I want to publish or subscribe to, and that means I need to configure the connection details each time,

or have a logic script that store arrays of values and the topics I want them published in, and map each array into the ""Array to Publish"" and set a routing where I call the MQTT client block using the Array to Publish values in sequence.

Did you format your payload at all. I am on holidays at the moment,( sitting in a tiny harbour on the southern most point in Ireland, listening to the sea and seagull -its magic.) but when I get back I want to write a proper payload routine. But I hate string operations in TIA, PEBCAK absolutely, but I still hate it.","",""

*In some scenarios an OPC UA Server may have resource limitations which make it impractical to expose large DataTypeDictionaries. In these scenarios the Server may be able to provide access to descriptions for individual DataTypes even if the entire dictionary cannot be read. For this reason, this standard defines a Property for the DataTypeDescription called DictionaryFragment. This Property is a ByteString that contains a subset of the DataTypeDictionary which describes the format of the DataType associated with the DataTypeDescription. Thus, the Server splits the large DataTypeDictionary into several small parts and Clients can access without affecting the overall system performance.

However, Servers should provide the whole DataTypeDictionary at once if this is possible. It is typically more efficient to read the whole DataTypeDictionary at once instead of reading individual parts.*","","üëçüèº (1)"

It's always felt like GE and Fanuc never really quite figured out their divorce. The GE Series 90-30 PLC will live forever in the Fanuc R-30i controllers. You have to map in and out of registers like it's a fieldbus. Figuring out the addressing scheme, mapping in UOPS, understanding the system variables, etc is weird. If you have a both an HMI and Kepware connecting to it, it will fault out. There is some obscure connection count setting that needs to updated. But, once you learn these quirks, you know them and the stuff just works.

The most bizare thing is that Fanuc Robots require Microsoft Frontpage to customize the teach pendant screen. Yes, it's HTML bound to ActiveX objects. I think I remember using this in elementary school. I thought was a joke when someone requested this in a service catalog fifteen years after it was last released.

The top grievance has to be all the disparate printed manuals, CD-ROMs, and robot options. For example, there are several overlapping ways to add EtherNet/IP support. Sometimes it's a package of options, sometimes it's an option, sometimes it only has the E/IP Adapter, sometimes it's an E/IP Scanner and Adapter, CIP Safety is a separate option, some also include the HMI Device option (SNPX/SRTP), etc. There's no good way to search and discover this stuff online.

I assume that you can access AB PLC via OPC UA server interface. If not, there are gateway products allowing to do so. For example DeviceGateway from our partner Takebishi.
Then you can use another application that allows to write to a variable in one OPC UA server when another variable in another OPC UA server changes value.

We're not an integrator, we're an OEM.  I'm trying to figure out whether it's worth the effort to implement additional functionality (CS) in some of our devices, or whether that would only be used by a few.

if i switch my PoV to an OEM it depends fully on the Device-Hardware... OPC UA is not the lightest communicationstandard but you can embed a lot of functionality in the model especially with CS, as an OEM you can offer Plug & Play with CS e.g. AutoId especially for customers which have Readers all over the place (e.g. logistics) they can standardize their connectors so the customer just need to point to the ua server (device) and a ua client can find the all the autoid instances on that ua server.

A&C has been showing up in some newer PLC and DCS implementations - especially S7 and PCS7. Users desired to read and normalize alarm data for external data consumers.

While low adoption overall, I would say it's starting to show up for a few reasons:
1/ Some PLC/DCS vendors have had it on their products for a few years now allowing for user uptake.
2/ There has been a trend towards formal alarm functionality at L1 rather than ad-hoc implementations between L1 and L2. For example, newer PLC firmwares will have specific instruction sets for alarms. OPC UA A&C is sometimes the only way or easy way to expose the alarm data.
3/ There have been enough new projects to use the newer alarm functionality.
4/ The use case is relatively straightforward.

Why it's not?
1/ A lot of new hardware is deployed to host migrated/legacy programs. Making use of A&C might require refactoring.
2/ It's challenging for users to experiment with new functionality under tight project or operational constraints.
3/ It's hard to standardize alarms across diverse processes and technologies let alone the exchange of alarms.
4/ There aren't many products that can consume it.
5/ It's not trivial to build support for. There is de facto ambiguity and varied vendor implementations. Vendors also need to consider how they're supporting structured data, if they aren't already.
6/ It's easier for a PLC/HMI vendor to create and productize their own alarm functionality to their customers' needs. It's harder to sort out the complexity of the spec and mitigate against variations in third-party implementation. For example, while Siemens has A&C support, I believe they're still using their own S7 protocol between their own products.

The market has figured out an OPC UA pattern for basic data access (e.g., Kepware, Matrikon, FTView, S7-1200/1500, WinCC, Wonderware, Ignition), but not necessarily for alarms and conditions yet.","",""

It seems like most SCADA people lean on the asset to define what alarms they should build and then refine from there. The simple, foundational use case will probably be just to aggregate alarms, however inconsistency they were defined in the assets, in one place.","",""

(https://flows.nodered.org/node/@opcua/for-node-red) for some coming projects.
There are easy to use!
They take away a lot of ‚Äúhassle‚Äù (e.g. browsing figuring out nodeids and browsepaths)
BTW it supports ExpandedNodeId‚Äôs out of the box so your Project is Namespaceaware!
Had a chat with the Author yesterday and he told me that in the next release the BrowsPath handling will be much easier because you will be able to use NamespaceUri‚Äôs in the BrowsePath-like addressing!

My Highlight is the Explore-Node which can return different Outputs e.g. a List if BrowsePaths or NodeIds he found, and which can be passed directly to a Subscription.
As well as it is able sharing a Client-Connection, in the Background, across different Nodes.
Each Client-Connection creates and manages 3 Subscription‚Äôs with different Publishing-Intervals (They can be extended or adjusted!) so you not even have to tangle around Subscription- and MonitoredItem-Settings!

Actually a well-crafted set of NodeRED-Nodes to get Data In and Out of an OPC-UA-Server!

So if your a NodeRED User you should check them out and you should consider using them in you next project üòâ","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166016891798700133/1316390515301941328/image.png?ex=68df2174&is=68ddcff4&hm=f5de90abe5989e4b300c5f8686bcf56022c19f2ab746f2c6371ef2a4a9ef048f&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166016891798700133/1316390515708792873/image.png?ex=68df2174&is=68ddcff4&hm=14e76da475d9d195d756b26044cb4a9a26022986e5853e5cfc8bdfad7daa08d8&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166016891798700133/1316390515989549108/image.png?ex=68df2174&is=68ddcff4&hm=07ab95439ba85f09dd845af81aa56b39291dbe9275fc9ec44c33735a155e54d6&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1166016891798700133/1316390516312641536/image.png?ex=68df2174&is=68ddcff4&hm=68dcd618d5008845b08cd812432b374e02738151674dbccfc7fe2e532335c8bb&",""

I heard rumours that Chinese EV manufacturers have a preference for TSN, but I have no details so don't know how true that is.

This is the future.  I know that there have been huge steps forward within the last 9 months in terms of TSN stability and spec adherance (across multiple vendors).  Tunnelling uses IEEE 60802 profiles.  Companies like Siemens and Rockwell will uses these to push their own little worlds, but those will eventually become largely irrelevant.  TSN is an open standard - it's just an extension of Ethernet, just like Gigabit was back in the day.  Open standards pretty much always win against the proprietary ones.

How do you manage bringing in more data from using Node-Red? It's been a little while now but I was trying to bring in a bunch of data into a Node-Red flow and publish to a broker but it was bogging down. I ended up using Ignition but interested in learning how people are managing Node-Red with a larger amount of data, ~1,000 OPC UA Nodes (tags).

Do you use Flow-Fuse? I think @NickN has some good tips on using multiple flows which I will review (I will search the server and look at his posts related to Node-Red).","","üëç (1)"

i can tell you the optimizations are fucking nuts.... it batches requests like hell... it manages all the hassle... it by default manages subscriptions... and the explore node uses a crawler to collect all the data for the json structure and i know the performance of the optimized client which manages really high loads and volumes of data, again its highly optimized!!! its more likely that the server is the bottleneck ^^
i mean you can go crazy an point to objects node and get fucking everything within 4 seconds and the test ua server is hosted in the google cloud ^^ 4 seconds for the entire serverstructure...

There are some smart people participating, but I wonder how much ""spin"" the OPC Foundation is generating. It's always a bit of challenging to grasp what is an idea/vision and what is actually real. The OPC success stories often appear to exaggerate organic market adoption. I sometimes hear stories of a user or vendor adopting something, but can't really find widespread use or any one of consequence familiar with it. It makes me wonder if these are lab projects funded with R&D / grant money and supported by those directly involved in the standard just enough to waive the ""mission accomplished"" banner.

This reminds me of the claims that the cloud service providers adopted OPC UA Pub/Sub. The ""results"" were  basically just scripts. The AWS implementation was a lambda function that subscribed to what was published and converted the UA JSON to the native service APIs. Microsoft's implementation were some projects on GitHub that basically did the same. They basically just created schema in services that persist data. The end user still needs to parse the format or query the schema. While it's consistent, it does raise questions whether a user would rather parse their own consistent schema vs OPC/VDMA's. Overall, these seemed more like demos or PoCs that a solution architect on staff picked up as a side project. There was no comprehensive product development that made use of this technology. Product teams build their services with HTTP interfaces or their internal service bus technology.

A good approach to cloud integration is to start with the destination services and work backwards from this. In many cases, the native API for the service is fine. Figure out if the service and use case benefits from streaming or batch ingestion. If there are multiple destination services involved or some stream processing is necessary to clean up / shape the data, it might make sense to go through an event ingestion service ahead of the destination service.","",""

But the DA part, I think, is pretty high. Most PLCs now have built-in OPC UA Servers, and SCADA/HMI and IIoT solutions have connectors to collect data from OPC UA Servers. Converting OPC UA to MQTT and vice versa is no problem. I see the major value of OPC UA as being a common connectivity platform at the OT level. At the higher levels, the MQTT / UNS approach makes more sense. At these levels, it might be much harder to follow some rigid standards, because each plant, production process is kind of unique. It might be much easier, instead of following some international standard, to create your enterprise-wide standard that is flexible and adaptable as production processes change over time. If we implement information and data modeling at the PLC / embedded application level, it might not be so easy, taking into account the often these devices are resource resource-constrained, data types are usually defined before compilation, not at runtime, and firmware updating might not be easy.  Therefore, I think it makes sense to have, at the lowest level, OPC Servers that implement only OPC UA DA, with a simple data model. And add support for enterprise-wide information models in the higher-level gateway/aggregator server.   It should allow designing of the information model at runtime, without the need to write/compile code. I think Prosys OPC UA Forge can be considered as such a next-level server.","",""

But you can automate most of this writing your own code and using our REST API. Some of our drivers have automated tag generation, others can grab tags from PLC project files, but otherwise folks wrap stuff around Kepware, often as part of managing more aspects of a larger system.

For standalone Kepware instances, here are a couple of scripts that takes CSV tags and uses Python and our REST API to create complete projects:

https://github.com/dad-io/kepware_public

There is one for bacnet & modbus (ignore the readme for the modbus one, is cloned from bacnet), and another in there that automatically integrates Kepware with Azure IoT Hub and creates the necessary MQTT objects in Kepware and in Azure to exchange data.

If you‚Äôre not familiar with software defined architecture principles and apps like terraform or others, once you are comfortable writing the code to do the actions you describe here, SDA can turn that intention into a repeatable enterprise process and manage multiple deployed Kepware projects from a single pane of glass, not for one-by-one tag or object management, but for ‚Äúthis asset is coming online, push related json object with correct mapping to Kepware#5‚Äù, or ‚Äúnew Kepware#6 is online and talking to xyz asset types, push full project with relevant objects and tags already created‚Äù

More work in code and infra up front make these frictions much easier later.

However - if this is critical data - you have to check the values, or write really solid code to do it for you, but even then - if critical data - put your own eyes on the values.

At a high level, it sounds like you're advocating the Don't Repeat Yourself principle by mapping tags with reusable scripts or config files. If I was working at a relatively new, large, carefully controlled facility with many identical machines that's definitely the approach I would take. To anyone working in such a factory, I envy you, but at least where I work, if we have 8 lines next to each other producing the same product, the PLC code running each line could be completely different.  Even lines bought at the same time from the same vendor could have been modified in the decades they've been running. Therefore making scripts might save time if you're lucky enough that a couple machines have similar code, but like you said, you're still going to have to spend time debugging and verifying that everything was mapped correctly. It feels like it's adding an extra layer of complexity that I'm sure is justified in some situations, but would be overkill for the majority of factories out there. 

I realize in my original question I was asking for a magic solution to avoid mapping tags one by one, but I'm starting to think there isn't a way to avoid that step and the focus instead should be on making that process as easy as possible. I keep coming back to the idea of essentially a smart csv file.  Make a spreadsheet with the  columns of the current kepware tag csv file and add columns for Device and MQTT topic (assuming you're using the Kepware MQTT agent). Add code to retrieve the latest tag value every time a row is modified and store it in another column. Add code to validate the tag addresses, device names, ensure no duplicates etc.","",""

Data discovery is such a hard part of systems integration and these devices and their protocols, like 99% of the time, have no schema for guidance. This problem has existed since the 70s when PLCs first were introduced. PLCs were left ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and mapping was owned by the programming software. We then started to go outside of the programming software just for the purpose of reading and writing for controls and data acquisition. This became a formal method before standards were created to solve the context problem ‚Äî meaning before driving for the PLCs to own context (schema). 

And it is clearly still a problem today. OPC UA really helps but is usually new systems only and/or is still rarely implemented compared to proprietary protocols that deliver more total functionality for the vendor (programming plus read/write, etc). We have some cross-brand/make/model/protocol solutions, it‚Äôs just that the best results come ‚Äúthe hard way‚Äù. You build support for ingesting PLC program files in their native format, or build something to query PLC interfaces for register numbers implemented or data objects available. Kepware implements this for a number of drivers but not all we could, and other companies are leaning into the ‚Äúdata discovery via controller programs‚Äù space. 

If you can get your tag lists, then since you‚Äôre in pharmaceutical and dealing with heavy regulations, you might find more consistency ‚Äî but in most environments consistency does not exist. There‚Äôs typically always a work stream for data discovery and mapping that is time consuming. In O and G for example, the problem is so bad - so many devices constantly changing owners as assets are bought and sold ‚Äî that now flow computer vendors just add a general var list and let people map internal registers to this internal list and rename them (fisher roc user tables, for example).","",""

The only reason I would ever add support for those protocols would be if I thought it would make the user experience better, so I take your points very seriously about cautioning against it.  I can see how it could make the user experience worse if wasn't actually good support.  Modbus on the other hand is something I could support relatively easily.  But on this note, does anybody have experience with an C libraries for interfacing with PLCs?  Also, if not adding support for PLCs, do you think there is enough value in the ETL workflow alone to convince somebody to want to try it?  Is there any area of this market that is currently being under served?  At my previous company solutions like Ignition would not be an option for just doing a simple ETL.","",""

So if/when I wanted to support these devices, and it's a big IF, I would probably leverage an opensource library and also contribute to it.","",""

In my opinion, OPC UA is a good common denominator, the protocol that practicaly any other protocol can be converted to without losing context. Practically any industrial protocol can be converted to it using off the shelf products like Matrikon OPC Universal Server, KepServerFX, Takebishi DeviceGateway. Each of these products took years to build, and they support hundreds of device types, it is not easy if not to say not possible to replicate any of these in a short time. Although, Litmus claims that they can add new protocol in a week or so. But even so, to add support for 100 devices would take about 2 years.","",""

Now, as part of the EMS upgrade, a new intermediate server running Windows Server 2019 has been introduced. The OPC DA server is running on Windows 10 and is named SVHost. A local user account named opcuser has been created, and appropriate identity permissions have been assigned to this user.

On both intermediate servers (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2019), a similar local opcuser account has been created. All three machines have different hostnames.
