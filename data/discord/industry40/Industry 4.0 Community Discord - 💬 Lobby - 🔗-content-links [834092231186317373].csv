The whitepaper talks about having a hardware that would run any software/logic from any vendor. The only other protocol I see something similar is KNX (building automation) where you have only one programming software.
But docker inside a control unit (PLC turned into UWC), that is the first time I see it 😀","","👍 (1)"

They don't specify in the paper what tool they use to manage the device and how they deploy docker containers.  Are they using ssh and scp, or do they have a more elegant solution/ecosystem?

Given multiple PCs with no operating system, each intended to perform different tasks, which of the following can ThingsBoard help with?

1) provide an image to be flashed to the PCs, which has the minimum OS needed for a docker interface
2) provide the user a dashboard of all deployed PCs  (cloud or onPrem), where the imaged PCs call home to the server running the dashboard
3) provide a user interface to modify system parameters of the PC: IP address, hostname, other
4) provide a dashboard to manage Docker (uploading of Docker images, create containers, start/stop containers, etc)
5) Allow group management of docker containers across multiple PCs (update images, etc)","","🙌 (1)"
"711186774629679166","faithware101","2021-05-24T14:34:13.5650000+08:00","1) Thingsboard is a server side application. High availability is key, you want to install it on computers or servers with very good network connection. You may install it on Amazon vps instance that runs ubuntu or any distro with the right kernel module especially btrfs and overlay2fs. You have to enable also bridge networking on the kernel. But most of the distros have it enabled for u. 
2) This is Sys admin stuff, you have to do it on your own using a container monitoring tool like Prometheus with grafana. 
3) again this is sysadmin stuff
4) again this is sysadmin stuff you can do it with portainer.. 
5) this depends on the clustering you want to use, either kubernetes or swarm. After that you need to choose the right graphical tools to manage your cluster. 
Hope this helps","",""

Most critiques of OPC technology, even among otherwise credible voices, have been ever so subtle.  Their message will veer along the lines that the technology is new, there is a lot to learn, and industrial technology moves slowly.  Or, they'll take an almost cowardly, neutral stance claiming that no technology has won out all the while simultaneously not prescribing a way forward.  They're so subtle that it's almost misleading.  One could say that this, in itself, is irresponsible.  They create the impression that, to those in the industry struggling to adopt this technology, it's only a matter of time until things improve:  An ecosystem of seamless interoperability is just around the corner.  They glance over the fact the technology is failing to help digitally transform manufacturers.  They do not call out the governing body and industry-at-large as responsible for the technology's poor outcomes.","","💯 (2)"

Rather than going in all guns blazing, the key is to strip away as much unique/identifying info as possible when two endpoints engage, then harden/reduce the capabilities of the endpoints doing the engagement.

This goes against the model of consolidation (one system to rule them all) that we have been running to this point and rather leans into task specific applications and hardware that has those key features of lightweight/edge driven/ect which gives you more control over those individual conversations.

I've spent a bit of time using some of Hashicorp's products and they build zero trust into the core of all that they do, it starts with secret management between systems, then moves into encrypted connections (SSL) between everything, once this is all automated, the complexity melts away.
You can relax a little knowing that technology is naturally flowing this way and its only a matter of time before everything you buy has zero trust baked in.","",""

The modules are geared toward faster time to value, not flexibility of the software. The OEE is not a true MES software. That said, it is simple to install and provides OEE quickly. Competing with products like RedZone, it is does this well.

It will be interesting to see where Emerson takes the platform. Progea is popular in the EU, specifically Italy. It was a strategic acquisition to gain HMI market in US and Emerson market in EU.","","👍 (2)"

AWS IoT Greengrass is a service that you install on local hardware to analyze data and act on it in real-time.

One of Greengrass’s advantages is the ability to remotely manage local applications (called Components).

It seems like a great solution for many Internet of Things challenges, but without understanding how it works…

Starting the Internet of Things (IoT) journey might be intimidating. IoT is not a “single thing”, it is a blend of multiple technologies and concepts.

I learned security, distributed system design, and other IoT-related topics the hard way. Often the wrong way. I made some painful mistakes during that process. It took me years to fully understand some concepts.

I would like to help you kickstart your IoT journey in the simplest way possible. It does not require any devices, only an AWS account.

I created a preconfigured IoT Lab for people interested in learning about the Internet of Things and building IoT solutions leveraging the AWS Cloud.
The IoT Lab is free to use. You can modify it according to your needs.

During this live meeting, I will explain how you can create the IoT Lab in your AWS account.

I will present a demo session utilizing this interactive IoT Lab to explain how to use it.

If you choose so, I can guide you during your IoT education.

I offer the ""Introduction to IoT at AWS"" training covering a general overview of the IoT domain, various aspects of connectivity, and device management using AWS Cloud.

Join this live stream to ask me any questions regarding the IoT and the offered training.

Compression absolutely still matters, but I argue that vendors should be focused more on compression prior to transmission on the wire over investing all energy into compression prior to storage.  That being said, if one is leveraging S3 for raw file storage, it is lighter on the wallet if the file, itself, is compressed.  We have many architectures where Canary history files are stored in S3 -- and without their compression, we would be paying exponentially higher costs for cloud storage than we do.  2. The swinging door algorithm has always been part of the problem -- it was designed under the assumption that raw events aren't important, only the abstraction of a series of raw events over time.  Most solutions architects have experienced the difficult conversation with clients -- when they discover many historians (like Pi and Ignition Historian) don't, by default, store raw events.  Rather, they choose to prioritize storing fewer records over storing all records more efficiently.","","👍 (5)"

- Most of the complaints they address are not necessarily related to quality issues, but more so safety technology.

- It really seems like the least techy cars performed the highest on the list. I'm a lifelong MOPAR fan, but Dodge is not know in recent time for it's tech. Cars are badass, but they are pretty archaic compared to their competition (on top of the fact they build like 3 or 4 car models now.)
- The Model 3 and Model Y door handles in my opinion aren't an issue, pretty simple to operate. The S and X can be annoying when it takes pushing the handle 2 or 3 times to get them to pop out. 
- J.D Power is not that reliable of an outlet. They're like Gartner: bought and paid for by the OEMs. I'm sure there was some backroom deals from the Big 3 to say Tesla has huge quality issues (Most Stellantis and all GM brands rank inside the study average, 3 Stellantis brands make up the top 3, and all GM brands ranked 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Also, due to cost criteria, component selection is very poor sometimes, fancy RF chips/modules come as LGAs, which are terrible from the reliability point of view in harsh conditions. Is one thing to put LGAs in consumer products that we buy more often and another thing in cars that we want to use for 10+ years.

0. IoT has matured and is ready for significant adoption.
1. The importance of Edge Computing is evident to stakeholders.
2. Organizations are ready for larger-scale IoT deployments (>10k assets).
3. Open-source mitigates the vendor-locking risk and provides great flexibility.
4. Connectivity + Security = form the strong foundations for IoT, but…
5. Data Management is more complicated than it seems!

Good news: C-level executives are in charge of IoT engagements. That results in two significant outcomes:

1. CxO are business-oriented stakeholders => IoT initiatives will focus on providing business value instead of technology experiments => more IoT projects will succeed => a broader group of C-level executives will take ownership.
2. CxO dispose of bigger budgets => IoT will move from PoC/MVP to production scale deployments.

The above points create perfect conditions for IoT to thrive. Enterprises are ready to invest in IoT solutions and leverage them as a competitive advantage.

Final thoughts: Keep calm and integrate the Internet of Things technology with your production environment. IoT projects are rarely disconnected from the existing IT/OT infrastructure - in real life, we typically work with Brownfield deployments. IoT is “just” an enabler that does not provide business outcomes on its own.

I value IoT Analytics’ reports for their objective, hype-free approach.

Their latest report elaborates why time-to-market for IoT products has increased 80% in 4 years. While this statistic alone could “justify” stating that the Internet of Things is slowly dying; fortunately, that is not the case.

Analytics identified four factors:

✅ Product complexity
✅ Regulatory hurdles
✅ Higher security scrutiny
✅ More advanced use cases

In my daily work, I observe the fourth factor most frequently. As the maturity of IoT solutions increases, companies are exploring more sophisticated strategies to leverage the IoT potential in their business operations.

What is your perspective? Which factor impacts the IoT time-to-market most?

here are some use cases in manufacturing/ industrial applications that i could think of : -
lessay i have manufacturing company which has some 5 plants with some 5-6 steps involved and each and its a semi-automatic process where human is only monitoring the process 
and im creating an ai assistant for my company, some of the capabilities that id build are : -
1) Process Optimization : -  to analyze large amounts of  production data to identify inefficiencies and suggest me a better usage cycle of the machines that i have for whatever product im manufacturing, in short to help me improve the effectiveness. 

2) Documentation and knowledge management : Assist in creating and organizing technical docs, manuals sops , all these can be made easier to acces for the employees working in the facility. They can like use voice cmds to get the info in any lang 

3)Training and skill development - for onboarding new employees, creating a training schedule along with materials summary etc for individual and skill development of current employees in preffered lang

4)Natural language Interfaces - control the systems using voice cmds or text cmds like the employee wont have to browse or even use the touch interface or click anything just a simple voice cmd he would be able to control the system scheduled runs, scheduling maintainace etc 

these are some of the use cases which i could think of, i dunno much anout the manufacturing industry, most of the use cases there involve images i presume, as of now our platform does not support image input so when we start the support for that then the use cases will increase 

additionally it can also be used for data analysis, logging 
however these the above mentioned use cases can be done via other ways which does not involve the use of ai,  but if we use ai the task would be accomplished quicker 

Conva is a platform that makes the integration of the ai quicker and easier.","",""

Leaving IA out of IIoT was a huge miss in my opinion, but once the criteria is set, we don’t want to make exceptions to favor a vendor. 

As noted, many examples of non Gartner customers in MQs. Even if they request to opt out, we can still put them in.  

Sales is going to sell. I would question their abilities if they did not push hard to get MQ entrants as clients. But they are not involved in the MQ process at all. 

Last point and maybe the most important is that MQs only limit vendors in the note itself. We certainly cover many more vendors and speak about them in inquiry. We advise only and don’t give recommendations. 

Happy to discuss further. Being new I didn’t realize this could be shared publicly. That, or this guy will no longer be employed soon 😂

The Vespa was designed to drive around potholes as Italy was not in a position to repair roads after WW2.

And in our work the ideal approach ( i.e. repair all the roads) is not feasible or to use a word I love, practicable.

So sometimes the non ideal approach is the right approach.

Big companies and big consultants can rip out and spend money to get the right foundation. They can do it badly if course but sometimes done well.

The Independent consultant, or small Integrator has to balance more for the right solution.

Maybe a bit of node red. Or maybe use the old InTouch 10 and a SQL DB for the recipe management.

But sometimes we can be too clever, and go with the low licence solution where the higher software licence would give more value, short and long term","",""

It sometimes has been challenging to educate the role of message brokering for just streaming/ingestion vs general brokering. The extent of MQTT support HiveMQ has for general brokering and the ability to effectively scale it is one of the primary value propositions. This gets overlooked with the cloud services. This article covered technical differences well. I really liked the ""Real-Life Examples & Implications"" part. This informs the audience what they might encounter as potential deal breakers when they evaluate different options.

More technology and solution comparisons (e.g,, cloud brokers, NATS, AMQP) would be nice. In general, the more education on the nuances of brokering, the better. For example, underrated features of MQTT or transitioning from MQTT v3.1.1 to v5. 

In recent years, I feel like the industrial space has fixated too much on ""dumping"" Sparkplug data to ""build a UNS"" without really understanding what message brokering is and the problems it solves. Some misunderstand it as a document database of sorts. Some think a single Ignition gateway publishing and subscribing to itself is distributed architecture. It would be nice to see more content the goes back to the fundamentals of MQTT to improve awareness of the why and the how. It's concerning when users set out to build architectures with ""Sparkplug-enabled ERP"" or the ""Parris Method"" for their UNS, but can't articulate when or when not to use QoS 2.

Other useful content might be to highlight MQTT ""common mistakes"" or ""anti-patterns"", alternative best practices, and how a company like HiveMQ might seek to extend the standards to solve a problem. Your team has a lot of experience and insights on what works well and does not work well in architectures.","","👍 (1),🔥 (1),🙏 (1)"

I'm grappling with introducing Industry 4.0 and Digital Transformation to small-medium sized manufacturers in the Food & Beverage / Fresh Cut / Prepared Foods industry. My experience shows that leading with this terminology often loses their interest - it sounds like Big 5 consultancy talk, implying large investments and long lead times.

We know this isn't necessarily true, but this perception is a real barrier.

I'm aware of the standard advice: ""If they don't have a digital strategy, walk away - not everyone can be helped."" While this may be valid, I can't give up on this industry. Providing food - especially fresh foods - to the U.S. and North America is crucial to me and central to my mission.

I keep circling back to a tactical approach: starting with an architecture and minimum technical requirements to minimize technical debt when investing in automation technology.

But I can't ignore Walker's success and his insistence on prioritizing Digital Strategy (why become a Digital Company?). I suspect that for some, we need to demonstrate the value of Industry 4.0 and Digital Transformation before they can grasp why they should invest in it.

Assuming Brownfield, the existing architecture will need to be taken into account as well. It doesn't always make sense to reinvent the wheel. Comfort zones and politics can come in here too.

After all of that, Maybe a pure UNS isn't the right tool... Maybe it is.

As well as a mandate to Integrators and vendors that may otherwise come in and build a half baked solution that doesn't scale.

The other statements are ""Start Small"" and ""Win the Results War"" - aimed at the people who are looking to enact change but may not have the power to effect much outside of their own domain. These are methods of gaining the prerequisite influence required to ""Start with a Digital Strategy"".

But for me Strategy is about understanding the Why.

As in, because the company is growing we need to equip people with the information and toos they need to do continue to deliver in the lean and agile manner they do now.

As opposed to  more established company that needs to develop Digital tools to  allow better communication between departments to remove bottlenecks and delays.

This fundamental decision impacts everything from onboarding efficiency to operational overhead. My latest article explores:

✅ Key trade-offs between isolated (repeatable) and shared (scalable) infrastructure components. 
✅ Strategies for cloud cost control and ease of maintenance in multi-tenant environments. 
✅ Why separating critical components like ingest accounts provides significant security and resource management benefits on platforms like AWS.

Noticed that Inductive Automation is not sitting at the Margo.org lunch table and after this year's ICC it's clear why not!
IA is already sipping champagne while everyone else is still deciding on the soft drink menu! Conforming to an industry-wide standardization would only constrain their innovation and feature shipping cadence. Ignition 8.3 is already interoperable, cross platform, edge to cloud native architecture, advanced container orchestration, DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code integration already implemented in 8.3. Now focusing on MCP and broader integration with Event Streams only pushes the envelope further.

Looks like Margo.org is fundamentally an industry response to IA's technological leadership. Both WinCC OA and Ignition have advanced interoperability capabilities, but why is Siemens in Margo.org while IA stays out?","","🤣 (1)"

Second, Margo is a very, VERY slow moving organization led by behemoths.  Third, Margo is part of the Linux Foundation, which is very unfriendly to subject matter expert participation.  They prefer paid participants, and the bigger the better.","",""
