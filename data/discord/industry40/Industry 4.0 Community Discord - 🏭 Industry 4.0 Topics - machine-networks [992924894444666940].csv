With networks, companies tend to invest in them or not invest in them.  In terms of readiness, you're basically looking to avoid a situation in which a company has big, flat, unmanaged network with no technical expertise available to do things you may need done (e.g., whitelist ports, setup VLANs).  The approach required for a small office network is completely different to that of a plant with hundreds or thousands of devices.  If it's completely brand new territory, it may not be bad idea to get consult with a local network engineer on a few projects.  Reach out to a partner of one of the large networking tech companies.

If you'd like to be thorough, read up on the Industrial Control System (ICS) reference architectures prescribed by NIST and the major network vendors (e.g., Cisco, Palo Alto Networks).  Because some of the vendor-specific reference architectures push their own solutions, read them with a ""grain of salt"".  Focus on understanding the concepts and themes (e.g., redundancy, topology, minimize broadcast domains, segmentation, determinism, QoS, NAT, access policies).  

Also, as a side note, you will likely encounter a lot of the ""Purdue"" security model in these architecture.  This prescribes DMZ'ing each level of ISA95.  Many in this community, for good reasons, are critical of this approach.  It can unwieldy in UNS and more contemporary IIoT architectures.  But, in basically every project, there will be a ton of unsecure devices with unsecure networks.  There has to be special consideration for this.  While MQTT is an ""outbound"" protocol with transport security, it's not a ""silver bullet"" for security.  Not every device has MQTT and not every device has a dedicated interface for it.  That same interface may be shared with a native protocol, fieldbus, http, ssh, etc to support other features.","","üíØ (2),üëç (1)"

Five identical CNCs fed by a gantry robot? They go into a /24 for the whole op.

Four very different operations (broach, wash, drill, balance) fed by two robots? And each asset has its own field network of I/O, motion, safety, etc? Too much complexity and too much complexity if something needs to change. Each asset will get its own /24. Asset-to-asset fieldbus communications will  get routed.

For the last octet, I‚Äôll reserve the first 10 for gateways (typically only need one). For the rest, every block of twenty represents a different device type (e.g., 11-30 PLC, 31-40 HMI).

Due to all the various browser plugins (e.g., labeling, files) and peripherals (e.g., gages, instrumentation), I generally prefer to stick with ""fat"" clients.  Additionally, it's easier for vendors to validate.  It can be challenging to get support when the vendors assumptions on deployments are a Windows PC and they don't know what VDI is.

My favorite VDI solution is VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure.  This solutions pairs the economical Windows licensing and scaling of Azure with the backplane management of VMware's Horizon.  It's integrated with VMware Workspace One.  Workspace One is a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) / Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solution.  In addition to managing devices and such, it offers a portal for end users of all their compute resources.  This could be everything from single sign on into SaaS apps to virtual apps and virtual desktops.  VMware markets this as a ""digital workspace"".  It's accessible from any device.

VMware's WS1 + Horizon offering can be accessed on any device.  Given VMware's historical ties with Dell, WYSE and Optiplex micro hardware is the go-to hardware offering.  But, one can use anything.  My favorite is on an iPad Pro with the magic keyboard trackpad.  It basically enables an iPad to runs everything it can't natively.","","üëç (3)"

The Rockwell version will have their browser-based config GUI. This version can also can exposed as a CIP endpoint to be managed over the EtherNet/IP fieldbus like one would with, say, a drive. This allows the switch to be configured with an AOI/AOP within Studio 5000. So, basically, a ControlLogix or CompactLogix could control the switch. Personally, I find this use case somewhat unusual. I have not played around with it or encountered it. Perhaps it‚Äôs for monitoring diagnostics if there is not something like SNMP in use.

The Cisco versions will be managed through IOS/IOS-XE. If I recall, some versions of the Cisco have a GUI. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the GUIs are similar or the same.

In either case, I‚Äôve seen scenarios where IOS and TFTP were required for provisioning. There are some limitations in the GUI for some functionality (e.g., some L3 features and routing) and they can be sluggish.

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/se/internet-of-things/datasheet-c78-743222.html

For in-panel (IP20) switching, the Cybervision reference architecture includes the Cisco IE3300 and IE3400 series.  The Rockwell equivalent of this is the Stratix 5800 series.  These have more in common with the current generation Catalyst 9300/9400 feature set.  These have the newer IOS (i.e., IOS-XE) and software-defined networking (i.e., DNA) features.

If would recommend looking into the protocol dependencies of Cybersion (e.g., SNMP, Netflow, SPAN).  This will ultimately determine what products and firmware levels are compatible.

At the end of the day, the Rockwell versions run the same ""Catalyst"" hardware and IOS software under the hood.  The differences are in the interfaces (e.g., Web GUI, Studio 5000 integration).  The feature set of each product line is largely a function of the generation of IOS it was built on.

The very popular Stratix 5700 / IE2000 and Stratix 5400 / IE4000 lines do not appear in the reference architecture.  These generally work with most network management tools, but not necessarily the latest software-defined networking tools.  These are more like the older Catalyst 2900 and 3700.  These run the older IOS (pre IOS-XE).

It's also worth mentioning that you may not necessarily need native Cybervision compatibility at the access layer in every machine panel.  You may get away with deploying through a Catalyst 9300 or VM further up in your distribution and core layers.  Industrial networks, at least in discrete manufacturing, tend to scale out at the distribution layer.  They have many, smaller networks in the access layer.","",""

TCP is the primary means of reliable data transfer in IP networks, which has served the Internet well since its inception and continues to be the optimal protocol for the majority of the communication.

For TCP in a data center, while best-case round-trip latency could be as good as 25 Œºs, the latency outliers under congestion (or link faults) can be anywhere between 50 ms and several seconds, even when alternative noncongested network paths are available.

This will make the biggest difference.  This service is often marketed as Dedicated Internet Access (DIA).  It's typically characterized by having single mode fiber, symmetrical bandwidth, lower latency, service level agreement (SLA), and costs more than what anything that involves a cable modem.  

Internet circuits that are marketed to small businesses are typically the same ""best-effort"" networks used for residential customers.  They just have a separate sales and support channels.  Operationally, it's the same.  This is usually not a dedicated internet access product.

In an ideal world, a site should have at least two dedicated internet circuits from different carriers.  That is, carriers that are diverse physically and how they route your traffic.  Otherwise, it's not helpful to have a second carrier that is merely handing off to your first carrier up stream.  From there, you can creating routing policies to choose the optimal path.  Or, you can even multi-home the circuits with BGP routing. 

You could also explore SD-WAN.  This involves deploying SD-WAN nodes at your site and in your AWS tenant.  These use ""overlay"" protocols (typically IPSec tunnels) across the various connections available between your site and AWS.  Based on the policies you define, it will optimize traffic across the connections.  It will actively use all connections and seamlessly remediate anytime performance degrades with the underlying transport.

If you have exceptional challenges, you could contract your carrier to setup a dedicated WAN circuit (e.g., MPLS, Carrier Ethernet) between your site and AWS.  It's costly.  It also requires an AWS service to terminate the connections.  Some partners will terminate at the edge for a lower cost.","","üëç (1)"

I am assuming that theses days the internet is locked down, so if there is a practice of connecting Laptops on the plant floor, over time vendors will start plugging in. Having an Engineering station that engineers can remote into allows a better level of control. Not using an Engineering station can lead to ""Version creep"". If I am using V11 of the programming software on my laptop , then another engineer using 12, upgrades the project on the PLC to version 12. when I come back I have top upgrade my software to allow me to access the PLC so I download V13, which is not the lates version. that happens at a time when production is stopped and backing up through the plant and It takes me an hour to get the new version set up, and I then find I need top upgrade the firmware on the PLC to allow V13 to view the   software. With an Engineering Station I can remote to it also allows people to log on from outside the plant to either take over in major issues, or even just log on to review the code. the Engineering Statin doesn't have to be a VM, I have used physical machines and VMs.","","üëç (1)"

Using DHCP for servers could lead to IP Addresses changing, which will make all the users mad when they have to change their setups.

Another route is to use DHCP with static reservations, where you can bind a Mac address to a fixed IP. the device still uses DHCP to get an address, but the assignment is deterministic.

Another option is DHCP assignments to switch ports, where a device connected to a specific port will get the same address every time. This helps speed up replacement of devices that support DHCP.

then there is also DHCP with dynamic update to a DNS server, where the device has a static hostname and advertises it to the DHCP server, then the DHCP server feeds it to a DNS server, so devices that support connecting via FQDN can reference the hostname without caring about what the IP address is","","üëç (4)"

Its opened my eyes up to the major trends in the internet, data centers, etc. With MaaS being more common, treating end devices as fully programmable nodes that can change behavior based on upstream demands....sounds very I4.0 like - but i have never seen an automation controls/network product that (for example) - could convert from linux to windows without major inconveniences and manual work.

To replace a PC running Windows Media Center, I bought a QNAP NAS and ran TVHeadend on that to record from a couple HDHomerun Extends (set to encode OTA MPEG-2 into h.264). To get channel data, I utilized ""mc2xml"" and ended up dontating to the developer to create a unique binary to run on the ARM architecture for the QNAP.

Then used a SolidRun Cubox-i4Pro running XMBC to watch the recordings and the video library.

Then bought into the HDHomeRun DVR kickstarter run that on a new QNAP NAS and use NVIDIA Shield running the HDHomerun DVR app.  Haven't used TVHeadend since....","",""

I never worried about converting the MPEG2 streams to H.264 since hard drives were cheap enough, although I do have the horsepower now. It's running my old Ryzen 5 3600 system. I went ahead and paid for the schedule data, it's like $24/year.","",""

First, thank you for this website! It has great content and very helpful.
My questions:
1. Is MTConnect an entire data structure standard? So, could I expect every OEM/vendor to provide the same informational hierarchy in a similar structure? (For instance: Equipment = Device -> Controller = Component -> Some Value = Device or something like this)
2. Was the intent of MTConnect to create an HTTP endpoint for external system to capture data? If yes, does this mean the external systems also need to 'poll' the HTTP endpoint to get 'realtime' data updates?
     Or, is there a way for the MTConnect Agents to publish the data externally?
3. I am not sure I understand the difference between the ""probe"" data and ""current"" data in the sample data provided? Is this also an MTConnect standard?
Reason I am asking is because I am considering following the link below, to create OEE metrics from a MTConnect enabled CNC machine. But, I am wondering if the data structure is consistent enough to be able to follow the same. (I have not had access to the CNC machine data yet, so I am not sure what it will look like.)

But, for whatever reason, MTConnect has not been intuitive for me. Seems like a great, strong data model. But I just keep facing a challenges sanitizing the data.
I finally captured the concept of Probe & Current data, and found there is an XPath endpoint I can use to filter data easier. But then, it seems like the XPath query is based on the /probe data structure and not the /current data structure, despite being used on the /current endpoint, which threw me for a loop. 
Finally, leveraging this XPath approach and I keep getting query errors from the Haas machine I am working with. Starting to think some XPath parsing logic is missing in that agent maybe?
So, now, trying to essentially use Json query to manually pick the data I want, but reading these huge data sets and writing these long paths is tedious.

I am very new to this server and networking in general but I would love to ask you guys a few questions relating to the AXIS API and its relation to networks and access (I also wasn't sure where the best place to ask this question was, so, if this is out of place please forgive me) 

I am working with an AXIS camera and this AXIS camera is running an Apache webserver which is what allows me to access it via HTTP calls through its API. But there are also apparently other portions of this server I have not utilized, specifically the RTSP API. The only issue is I dont know how to make a call that could interact with this API in python. I am working with some older stuff so I am trying to mostly (if not exclusively) work with the 'urlib2' python library as its given me the best results thus far. The call I would like to make is something along these lines: <Picture> (To hopefully find a way to stream in my browser with good ol HTTP)


The reason I'm asking this in the networking section is because once I can make this call properly I was hoping to ask:  how will the traffic to this server suffer in a negative way if I go about it using this portion of the API.

In recap: how on earth do I make this type of a call in python and what are the consequences of this action.
(Also, I am certain this is a fairly simple call but the more detail the better as this is still very new to me)

If you missed it, here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb6GlTmER44, if you have' t I would highly recommend, its an excellent video on DTMA, Platforms, and DT for MFG in general. 

That being said, I was surprised on the network section when Walker was going over their DTMA. Analyzing just coverage seemed a bit shallow to me. In my view, the ability for Network Operations to facilitate rapid iteration is absolutely critical for digital transformation and assessing digital maturity. When I conduct my own DTMA assessments for manufacturing sites, I make it a point to include a thorough evaluation of Network Operations activities. The reason is that while most of our sites may have 100% coverage, the real differentiator lies in how agile and responsive the Network Operations teams are.

Some sites are leveraging modern network technology that allows us to make network changes in minutes, which is essential for supporting the fast-paced, iterative nature of digital initiatives. On the other hand, some sites are still using outdated technology and have understaffed Network Operations teams, where even minor changes become a cumbersome and time-consuming process. This disparity can significantly impact the overall digital maturity of a site and its ability to adapt to new digital tools and processes.

In my opinion, for a DTMA to truly reflect the digital readiness of an organization, it should encompass not only network coverage but also the agility and capability of Network Operations to drive and support rapid transformation. I'm curious if anyone else had similar thoughts. I really appreciate Walker's DTMA, but the network section didn't fully resonate with me.","","üëç (1)"

I run into similar issues during my site surveys‚Äîpeople tend to get nervous when DT efforts bring more transparency, especially when it comes to analyzing how effective their processes really are. It‚Äôs one thing to claim a certain level of maturity, but actually being at that level is another story altogether. I've seen this issue crop up a lot back when cloud adoption was first becoming popular. Many sites would say, ""Yeah, we're leveraging the cloud,"" but in reality, all they were doing was spinning up a few EC2 instances. They weren‚Äôt taking advantage of managed services or using cloud-native design patterns, which is really what leveraging the cloud is all about, in my opinion.

That said, I think the issue you‚Äôre bringing up is a little different from my point about network maturity. I just believe there's so much more to network maturity than just L1 coverage. Network Operations is a big factor, as I mentioned earlier, but there are definitely other aspects that need to be considered as well.","",""

The idea is to change all the IPs to an specific range and build subnets using the mask(a water management system with 10 devices get a mask 28 that give you 14 host address), then the firewall will route systems that are needed(to collect data from each system).

I agree that throwing edge hardware to handle protocol and network translations has scalability issues. It's a lot to procure, install, and support. On the other hand, if connecting for the first time, it‚Äôs not realistic to assume every field network (e.g., machine builders delivered with 192.168.1.1/28 on every asset) can easily be uplinked to one flat network. This will have to be resolved somehow - either on the devices or on the network.

I would look into figuring out an access and distribution network strategy. You could do your NATS here rather on disparate edge devices. At a minimum, there should be managed layer 3 switches to segment the field networks.

Personally, I think plants should take control of their field networks and get accustomed to managing addresses. I understand it‚Äôs not always possible or that it‚Äôs a challenge, but there is also a ‚Äúcost‚Äù to leaving everything as-is.  Planning and cleaning up an address space creates more network awareness and mitigates risks. It‚Äôs healthy. It‚Äôs also way less confusing for technicians not accustomed to having a ‚Äúpublic‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate‚Äù addresses for the same device.

In a discrete manufacturing environment, I would recommend segmenting every asset or cell with local field communications into its own /24. Make sure a gateway address is defined on the devices. Setup inter VLAN routes if different cells need to communicate beyond their local network. These can be used to drive security policies. For acquiring data, use a a software based protocol gateway (e.g., kepware). The network will route to the devices to connect. This can be done on managed switches and remotely administered.

TL;DR: Don‚Äôt use a fleet of edge devices. Use big 48+ port rack unit switches at the distribution frames instead. Plan and segment the network. Connect to the devices natively and make your ‚Äúedge‚Äù a software node above this.","","üëç (1)"

We are actually discussing this exact route - the idea is that the local expertise doesn't exist, so land the devices and perform NAT at the IDF. However, that still requires corporate IT support. Where, local edge devices would not but it turns into 'NAT at the Edge' vs 'Edge Gateway'. I should clarify that in this case we wouldn't be using the Gateways to translate protocols, but rather just to ""connect"" and get the data, land it via OPC at the Edge OPC Server (Kepware).","","üëç (2)"

But are you really looking at connecting all the OT equipment back to 48port switches?  I find two big problems with that approach , the first is it is much harder to trouble shoot OT comms issues, and at a some point in the future, someone will want to move the equipment.

@Andrew Camm does having a NAT device at the edge, or even in a switch room really need less expertise to manage, than just changing the IP addresses as they arrive? Or giving the Vendor a set of IP addresses as they are building?

The best middle of the road approach I have recommended, is to have an 8 or 16 port Level 3 Managed switch in a panel for the Production Network and a second dumb switch for the local Machine network. 
Have 2 IP addresses for a PLC , one is connected to the Production network via the managed switch, the other connected to machine level equipment, mainly RIO.
Some equipment can be on either network like flow meters, drives etc but you can either connect them to the machine network originally, or connect them to the managed switch.
But all of the equipment in the machine has a unique IP address for that Plant, and if you want to connect form the Production layer( SCADA or IIoT platform) you can move equipment from one switch to the other.

you can then in the future if needed connect the second dumb switch into the managed switch, or upgrade it to a managed switch and have fancy stuff like rings/MRP etc

Anyone I have worked with who had had the NAT device at each machine, tend to rip it out and migrate over all the equipment to unique IP addresses after a year of digital transformation.","","üëç (2)"

Communicating within a field network is generally best done locally. It makes a lot of sense to keep dependencies within an asset or cell.

The approach you mentioned involving an ""8 or 16 L3 managed switch in a panel"" is more or less what I was describing, but with rack and structured cabling infrastructure. I would add that, if deploying in machine panel is not a requirement, rack switches usually have better reliability features, higher port density, and are more available/economical. Being able to ""stack"" in high availability configs and hot-swap power supplies is very useful, for example.

I'm not following the point on troubleshooting. Could you elaborate? In my experience, the amount of observability tools that can consume NetFlow, J-Flow, IPSIX, etc is extensive compared to what's available for most (not all) industrial switches. The alerts and reporting can save so much time for everyone involved.

I definitely agree on the NAT point. It tends to rack up even more technical debt.","",""

I have seen proposals where every field device that connects using an ethenet cable would be wired back to a Rack.
So you had a PLC communicating with a VFD in the same Panel, communicating Via a Rack 50m away.

I didn't think you would propose that, but it reads a bit that way.

instead of a 0.5m local cable connection that a maintenance technician could pull out . and make sure the correct lights were flashing.
I am think here where the comms are Control Level, and especially if the components are close to each other, a local connection is the way to go.

I also do like not having lots of OT devices( Profibus in my experience) on the same network as Production Level VM's.
Stuff like backups and system scans and all the other rightly essential IT stuff, messes with the comms layer.

Missed quality checks, missed starts for new work orders, or even issues with Safety communications, out of sequence packets and the like shutting down. 
And they always seam to happen at the same time every day, and every 8 hours.

or my personal favourite, where an Old Siemens TI PLC would crash at 12:05 on a Friday, and the electricians would head up pull out the comms car and put it back in.

and segregation is great, until you need to have the devisces publishing directly into your UNS, or even connecting allyour drives, to the drive manufacturer predictive maintenace software etc.

It is therefore necessary to have service orchestration tools (Node-RED), tools to exploit machine methods such as Focas APIs, and finally a solution for moving binary files.

The new S71200 have a Comms dedicated processor. The OG don't though.

I've run into issues where the number of connections allowed is an issue. Normally on old Rockwell micrologic. I remember having to stop one of the IO drivers to connect to troubleshoot","",""

On the PLC 5, nothing like the 2am service call to get the program loaded after a maintenance shutdown (dead battery) without the proper cables. Had to cut a 25 pin cable in half, plug one end into an adapter for the PLC and the other hand soldered to a db9 and then to a USB adapter to get connected to my laptop. From there, I could set the IP address of the Ethernet adapter add on and get it back up and running.  Had to get them back up by the 6am shift... It was an old flour mill, Microsoft Access / SQL server for the MES and Kepware for connectivity with iFix for the SCADA. Major pain to work on that one...
