We need to discourage active selling and active business development on the server (or provide a channel just for that purpose that people can mute if they so choose) or else we will drive away the community and be left with nothing but a bunch of BD guys trying to sell to one another.","","👍 (228),✅ (2),💛 (2),💯 (1)"
