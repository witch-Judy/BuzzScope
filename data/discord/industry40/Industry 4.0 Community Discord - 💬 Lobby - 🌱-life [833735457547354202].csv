And ""diversifying"" to some means socially conscious investing as well, knowing that the risks and returns are far less predictable.  I find it astonishing that we celebrate Microsoft's stock price knowing the absurd margins that their near monopoly (like other tech companies) allows them to charge.  Only slightly more than the sugar water/junk food diabetes purveyors and a lot more than most energy companies.   

Also, they both took the Giving Pledge, and if you can't see how great that is, well, I dunno what to tell you.  And both intend to give away virtually all of their wealth eventually.  Then let's add on the Gates Foundation's work.   Bill Gates is an imperfect person (as is Warren Buffett), but they're even close to as  evil as some of their peers.","","😆 (1)"

The policy idea was to increase the number of EVs to a point where the supporting infrastructure would be good enough that it would make sense to buy one. Now that the goal is closer, you see a lot of the incentives go away or being reduced. In the beginning the most sold EV was the Nissan Leaf, because it was a really attractive offering as a secondary car. In the last few years, it's been the TM3 because it's a really attractive offering as a primary car. 

Would sales of new EVs outnumber gasoline ones without the subsidies? Absolutely not, but there is a very high probability that it will continue to do so when the last subsidy is removed. The prices have come down to a level that makes them competitive even if we added sales tax (which is the main subsidy right now) and most of the other subsidies are gone. 

Surveys in Norway have shown consistently over the last years that people who buy an EV value a lot of other stuff other than the subsidies. And a very common sentiment is that once someone has bought an EV, they are unwilling to go back to a ICE vehicle.","",""

I don't think every vehicle class will move to batteries, but that's hardly an argument for keeping all vehicles powered by gasoline. There will likely always be some use for gasoline, and the army is likely to be a large portion of that, I also think it's highly unrealistic to have cross Atlantic flights on battery powered planes, but smaller 15-30 min flights with 10-30 passengers seems realistic on a 5-10 year timeline. 

The victory of EVs in Norway is the result of enforcing policies that make that attractive. It's a highly coordinated effort that turned out to work really well, and now we're getting the results from it, which is that most new vehicles are EVs and eventually that will be true of all cars, both new and old. 

Tesla having the most sold model in Norway over the last few years is probably mostly a result of them having a product that you can actually buy. The traditional car manufacturers have been slow to act, and struggling to deliver any kind of volume, meaning people wait months and months for delivery. Heck, Toyota is releasing their first EV this year, and Nissan spent years doing who know what after their success with the Leaf before finally shipping Ariya this year.","",""

Do you also use reading apps, such as Blinkist or Shortform? 
What are your highlights in the apps?

Overall, I think Nuclear is the best bet for safe, green, reliable, and low cost energy production. I think Solar is a great consumer option, and is much more effective if we used it on people's roofs, etc. The issue with Wind is maintenance cost. It's a great renewable energy, but so costly to maintain it tends to not be worth it to governments and companies to go out and repair them.

There are reasons you need to follow the Code to ensure that your solar don't end up powering a line believed to be dead. SO I can't understand how they stop you using the power you produce.  Are they metering the inverter? 
Can you change the Electricity provider or are you tied to the utility in your locaity.

The incentives in Ireland are not too bad, though some still complain. No VAT( so a 23% saving there) There are also grants available. the utility don't know how much you produce they can only see your meter. so if you offset all your bill then no charges for usage. we have usage charges and standing charges. If you have a smart meter thatn can measure import and export then you get paid for what you export it is about half what you pay to export, so you want to try to nto export. But because there are a lot a non smart meters. in those cases they give you a deeped export based ont he soze of your inverter.. So today I've generated 11Kwh,  I've exported a lot of that 6.5kWh but because I am deemed export it doesn't matter how much I export I get paid the same. I've only consumed 7kWh today but I did import 2.5kWh. The trick is matching the appliances and the Sun.

I could get a battery and export less, but its about a 15 year payback so not much point.
I only have a 2.4kWh system but if I could get it to maybe 4kWh and a battery. That coupled with a bit of wind would really reduce the amount of Co2 generated.

I would have thought lots of the US woul have a summer peak where AC is the major driver and Solar and AC must be a great mix really. In Ireland our Energy use is in the winter, noone has AC at home at all.

I would support nuclear for baseload, but I can't see it happen in Ireland for a while. Chernobyl is still in the popular Psyche here , due in no small part to a great charity that brought children from Belarus to Cork for holidays.","",""

Unfortunately there are other energy providers, but the terms of the city's contracts make it difficult for people on the city's energy plan to leave and go with a new plan (that area of the state is fairly corrupt 😕) In Texas there are pretty good incentives for solar. 

As far as energy usage goes, it really depends what part of the country you're in is. State's in the Sun Belt (like Texas) use a lot more energy during the Summer (our energy use doubles,) but in the Rust belt I suppose there's more energy demand in the Winter. You a good chunk of the US where you need AC during the Summer, and need quite a bit of energy for heat during the Winter. Then you have California, who lives in a constant state of 70 Degrees F and Sunny 🤣 

Solar is really good in the South. You're seeing more and more homes install solar panels on their roofs, particularly in Texas and Florida. I'm not too privy to the Solar incentives to other states, but if my knowledge serves me well, Texas and Florida have some really good incentives for it.","",""

Learn Python, or at least how to code with Python Via ChatGPT. There are a lot of courses online
Learn a bit about containers, Docker and portainer.

Download the Ming Stack - Mosquitto, Influx, Node Red, and Grafana, and replace Influx with timescale if you want to be cool.

If you have a PLC handy, maybe , maybe simulate a machine. and build some Logic in node red, convert the PLC tags into MQTT topics, Store data in Timescale, and graph it in Grafana.

If you don't have a PLC, just write a python script to simulate a machine with a modbus 

If you don't know how, as Chat GPT to guide you through
- Write a Python script that counts from 1 to 100 and then resets and stored that values in a modbus register
    (or one that writes the CPU usage, Ram Usage and processor temp to modbus registers)
- Write a node-Red Flow to read the value from modbus and publish it to a MQTT broker
- Write a Node Red Flow to subscribe to that topic and store the value in a Database.
- Create a Grafana screen that monitors the Value in the Data base.

Then ask Chat GPT how to install the Mind Stack in a docker container and go again.","","💯 (8),🩷 (4),👍 (4),🙏 (3),🔖 (2),❤️ (2)"

I need some data to evaluate a design prototype for my final project.

My project’s topic is “improving the navigation and usability of online recipe platforms”.

Basically it adds a ""Jump to Recipe"" and ""Jump to Ingredients"" button which float at the bottom of a recipe page, and I'm evaluating if users appreciate it or not.

(I had no idea what a [dishwasher chopper blade](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0921WLV92?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) was)  Got the sparkplugs replace before 10 am the next morning to make it to my 10 am meeting in town.

I fully agree that Elon Musk is the Entrepreneur of probably the Century . Certainly of our time, hands down, 
But there are two things, 

I look at what he claims on timelines, and compare it to what that reality is, so I have a trust issue with any of the other claims too.
And I don't think it was just overly optimistic, I think it is lying but I don't know. maybe he did have a Saudi Investor to take Tesla Private.

And then he was also very lucky. He built a manufacturing company, and didn't outsource, and it paid off, but it was really close to not paying off, so did . He was able to get insane amounts of capital, in what it might be claimed as lets say questionable ways. But when I say lucky I fully acknowledge that there ae only a small cohort of people who could put themselves into the position to take advantage of those lucky breaks. And Kudos to him, honestly

But I think any discussion ultimately comes down to.
Tesla is probably the most advanced manufacturing company in the world,( I don't have numbers so don't know)
but they are way way way way way way behind the place where Elon claimed they would be.

So I'm not sure it would be a great podcast.
I would much rather see a podcast with the CEO or Engineering manager who took a small 50m legacy manufacturer and turned them into a 250m revenue company by Digital Transformation","",""

As I brace myself to a hundred or so Trick or Treaters,  I think I would prefer the pagan version, Bonfires, Food, Drink and Mischief.

But on the topic of wealth distribution, I am curious to some reactions to the following trends. Since 1980 (trickle down economics’ birth? ), the top 1% has almost doubled their share of wealth distribution, while the middle class has lost an almost equivalent amount. (See attached plots). This decline of the middle class can largely be seen as the top 1% being enriched at the cost of the middle class. How do you react to those kind of trends?

For Context the current government is FF,FG and Greens , Fianna Fail( Soldiers of Destiny) and Fianna Gael( Soldiers of Ireland) are the two sides of the Irish Civil war, both very centrist( FG a bit more to the right), and one of they has lead every government since the foundation of the state,

for FF Michael Martin is a former Taoiseach( PM), FF party Leader, has been elected for the past 40 years or so, 
Seamus McGrath is a  local councillor but he got the highest first preference votes of any councillor in Ireland in the last local elections, and his Brother is a former finance minister and  current European commissioner,
Margret Kenneally - she is really mopping up votes, if she can get people from here area to vote for her and give then their no 2 to Seamus McGrath when whe is eliminated he might get across the line.

Donncagh O'Laoighaire , is a sitting TD for Sinm Finn, the main opposition party, they are having some scandals at the moment, so a year ago  they would have been hoping to pull Michelly Cowhey Shahid across the line with her, but it might be a bit too far,

FG, their deputy leader is retiring, so there is a bit of a gap they have two popular councillors and Jerry Buttimer a former TD and current Senator (our senate is not directly elected). I think they will get 1 seat, but it could be any of the three, and it might two of them left after a couple round and whoever has the nose ahead when the other gets eliminated , will be elected.

the fifth seat will be a battle royal, between a second SF and FG seat and I would say Mick Finn( a popular local socialist), and depend very much on Transfers,

The Irish parties are very huddled around the centre( even the centre left support a low corporation tax)

 In 1919 Ireland was partitioned in to Northern Ireland and the rest.
So at the end of the war of Independence, we signed a Treaty with the UK giving the remainder independence, and the main Political Party in the State was sin Fein, however it split between the supporters of the treaty and those who wanted to keep fighting for Norther Ireland.
that split lead to a civil war and the two sides became Fianna Fail( anti Treaty) and Fine Gael( pro Treaty). And Until 5 years ago one of those parties formed the govt.
normally FF with majority and Fina Gael ,the more right wing party with the support of Labour. We had a 2 and a half party system.

so given there was a civil war, very few votes were transferred between FF and FG.

in the 90's smaller parties and independents started to gain traction so not FF and FG get about 40% of the vote, and 5 years ago went into coalition , with the greens.

So I expect there to be a lot of transfers between those two. Which would have been madness in my grandparents generation

sometimes people want to vote against the status quo and there votes might go from a very right wing to a very left wing party.
there are also a cluster of centre smaller  left parties( Social democrats, Labour, even the Greens) who will transfer a lot between each other, but not as many will transfer to Sinn Fein, through very similar positioning wise.

Sinn Fein don't trace back to the original Sin Fein , but really come from Northern Ireland where they were the political wing of the IRA.  with the Good Friday Agreement, they have reformed and become very popular as an alternative left party. they have taken a lot of traditional Labour support, and had a huge vote in the last election, but not enough to form a government despite being the largest party.","",""

Many people will vote for someone from their area over Policy, especially if you think that person might become a Minister in the next government.
so a more right wing candidate can transfer a lot of votes to a left wing candidate becuase they come from the same area.

People should have a vote, and feel like using it matters.

To me the biggest issue with first past the post, is 
- you often end up voting against the party you dislike more.
- you end up voting strategically to achieve that.

that can lead to strategic voting and people don't get to vote for the person they actually want.

with ranked choice it gives smaller parties a chance, Their supporters can vote for them, and show that they support them, but still end up with a usefull vote.
that can signal to other voters that actually there is more support here for Party X I might get involved.

but the multi seat to me is really great for participations.

Look at Texas and California, both about 60/40 when you look at votes cast. but 2 senators from the same party in each.
Imagine running both Senate seats at the same time and the top two get in.
and a popular third part might even have a chance to get sneak a seat in.","",""

 I think adding in multi tenancy, ( RCB becomes Transferable ballot) helps a lot .

But just because we can't be perfect, means we should not try to be good.
and I really thing FPP has more bad features than good.

Pool 2 (IT) = Cloud Solution Architects and Software Developers. Someone that understands how to write software (not PLC programming) and has a strong knowledge of structured programming and databases. Or someone with a background in cloud dev ops. 

I then cross train these people on the area they’re lacking in. So if I hire a OT person, the first thing they’re going to do is go through AWS Solution Architects Associate certification. And if I hire an IT person the first thing they’re going to do is get Ignition certification.","","🔥 (3)"

I have seen that a lot of you have said that your master didn’t necessarily make you a better engineer in the field and some saw the choice as a setback of 18 to 24 months. The main reason I would like to do a master’s is to become a better problem solver. A good engineer is a person that can solve issues regarding a technical topic (if you disagree or believe there are other factors, let me know because I would like to improve).
My current job has taught me self-discipline to a degree. It has taught me to work 8 hours and have a routine that is aligned with the world. The issue is that the job has limited growth potential for me because they don’t need a problem solver. They need a salesman, and the issues are not difficult to solve. Therefore, I would like to take a master to craft the ability of problem solving by joining “student formula” and working for good grades. 
From a financial standpoint I need to take up debt and I understand that debt is a double-edge sword, and I am as much as a person can be aware of the risks. 
The ideal scenario for me would be mentored by someone who is experienced in the field. Why can’t you not self-learn? I believe it’s because I don’t trust my judgement and my time is limited by my work and do I have enough discipline to work after work? Therefore, I believe master will be a step closer to my goal. 
I would like to hear your thoughts about this.","",""

If you need to take on debt, then the equation becomes harder to justify in my book... But the only one who can answer that for you is you.

If the goal is to become a better problem solver though, I really don't think a masters degree will get you there. 

I personally hire engineers with degrees when I want someone who can think inside the box. Someone with the discipline to complete documentation or someone who I need to read and understand  industry standards.

When I am hiring someone who needs to think outside the box that degree is either meaningless or even a slight detriment in a tie breaker. Real problem solving abilities are not learned in a classroom, they are learned through real life experience, failures, triumphs, and long nights struggling to find a viable solution. 

Though, to touch on the reasons for not being able to self learn.

If you don't trust your judgement, a degree won't give you the confidence you need to overcome this. This will be a much larger hurdle than any lack of problem solving or technical abilities. 

If you don't have time to watch some videos, read some books, and play with the tools on your own time - what makes you think you will have time for a masters program?

Basically, if you lack the discipline to learn on your own - a degree won't do much of anything for you...  

I don't know of any degree that will teach you discipline or true problem solving skills that will translate to the real world. 

That said, I have worked with, for, and even hired people with technical PHDs, BFAs, Associates, High School diplomas, and almost everything in between. Some of them felt it was worth it and others didn't.","",""

It was basically a factory that turned out service techs for the big local packaging Machine Builders... We started with ""What is an atom"" that went into electrical theory, digital electronics, motors and drives, PLCs pneumatics, CAD, Machining, and Fanuc robots. Capstone was groups of 4 designing and building robotic cells with a couple Robots each. 

All that, and the most important thing they taught was troubleshooting. One example is, when doing the capstone, they would replace a fuse with a bad one so that when we got there in the morning the things that worked yesterday didn't work today. When we asked for a manual they would purposely give us the wrong one or make us look it up online. 

As for resources, everyone learns differently, for me most of what I know came from client requests or generally solving problems in the moment. When I want to learn more about stuff outside of that I try to spin up what I can in a home lab and get my hands dirty. 

For me, nothing teaches me better than just doing it. 

And for better and worse, I spent a lot of my career at a fledgling integrator where I had no choice but to figure it out on the fly.","",""

Right now at my company we are deploying the infrastructure of a Digital transformation (Mqtt broker, Ignition, and dataops with cloud AI). Im learning a tone and it is fun. My problem is just like any end user at a manufacturing plant, I wear multiple hats. Finding time to really focus and learn at a quicker pace can be challenging. I think in the future I might switch to a integration job where I can see multiple things to get my hands 'dirty' with more technologies.","","🔥 (2)"
