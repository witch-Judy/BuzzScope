I‚Äôm fortunate that Banner allows me to wear many hats in this role but my current primary focus is developing a network of integrators and partners to provide our customers turnkey solutions driven by our hardware.

This can include defining scope, hardware guidance/recommendations, network topology, cloud integration, new target markets, or new standard basic end to end solutions provided by Banner.

I have a Bachelor Degree in Information Systems, as well as a Technical Degree in Electronics.

I have been working for the past 23 years with Software for Industrial Automation, mostly SCADA for Power Companies, but also Historian, MES, SPC and Traceability. So, I consider myself an IIoT Engineer Software focused. Two years ago I left my previous company to join PackIOT as a Co-Founder. I'm glad to be here with so many great brains. Thanks for the invite @Walker Reynolds ! I'm particularly very interested to apply and learn new technologies, merging IT with OT and to help this market to be more open and diverse. In my opinion very little changed on PLC/SCADA/MES/Historian from 1980 to 2010 and  I particularly think people are now watching the transformation of this market in the front-seat, and people like us from this community are actually driving this transformation. And the transformation is broad, not only technical but also as companies and professionals present themselves. Who would think 10 years ago we would have IIoT Vloggers?

@Deleted User  Is it an OEM, Tier 1, Tier 2, etc - most of the folks in that industry are awake and smell the coffee (though not all), so I would point him toward Walker's YouTube videos and depending on his professional background (IT/OT/SCM/ENGR/MBA etc) possibly this Discord server. If he attended ANY conferences pre-COVID he must have learned about Industry 4.0 which can be interpreted various ways but is ultimately about getting data to a common place where it can be used to improve operational efficiency. If it helps, you can tell him that the Big 3 are all about it, and I know that because I'm running a project for USCAR (www.uscar.org)","","üëç (4)"

@Deleted User Do me a favor -- rate your skillset in each category on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 is highest)

1. PLC -- Ladder Logic/Function Block/Structured Text

2. Python, Javascript, C#, Java

3. SQL

4. IIoT Protocols -- MQTT, DNP3, LWM2M etc

5. SCADA -- any platform

6. MES -- any platform

7. ISA-95

8. OPC-UA, DA, HDA

9. Ethernet-IP, TCP/IP

10. Network Administration (L1 - L3)

11. TensorFlow, other ML

12. Mobile App Development

13. Instrumentation

14. Business Intelligence

And send me your resume -- happy to give you feedback.  It is important to note that the Industry 4.0 professional is a hybrid, automation and controls on the far left of the scale, computer science, data science on the far right of the scale -- I 4.0 pro is in the middle with their feet in both worlds.  It is far easier to teach the automation pro the computer and data science than the other way around.  Though, you need both types of pros on your team.","","üëç (6),üôå (1)"

@Deleted User Hi, I had similar frustrations couple of times. manufacturer (big and small) asked us to research IIoT or AI tech for them, but when asking a proper position in the industry, the answer is always 'we are not prepared for a data scientist position in our business'. Me and other guys I know, meet these situation many times, and many of the talent and ambition lads left the manufacturing sector at the end. Recent, one of the top mobile app lead company has asked me whether interested in working with them to develop edge AI tech, with doubled+ pay. The tech is what we are developing for IIoT, but can also be used for mobile applications. I was very sad after this that the industry you love actually cannot treat you well, compared to the tech-intensive sector, like Google, MS, AWS. What I feel, Google, MS, AWS are marching on the market where GE, Siemens, PTC used to dominate... These IT companies actually can make hardware, e.g. Google's nest, FB's oculus...Once they dominated talent, and sooner or later they will start the invasion driven by capital needs,  these traditional industry vendors (especially who have large software sales now) have little chance to fight back. The way how industry software adopts IT tech is much slower than how IT companies adopt and change the industry business model. However, I hope industry guys can find a way to hold industry fields. Maybe one possible way is 'start-up', keep an independent way to develop these techs for industry users without limited too much by the 'culture'.   ü§ûü§û ü§û","","üëç (5)"

I coming into industrial automation with a background in control systems using microcontrollers (ARM, PIC, AVR, Arduino etc) using a lot of cloud connectivity.  I've recently joined the R&D team at a pulley manufacturer and a part of my role on that team is to bring in new manufacturing technologies. As I started to assess the current landscape of industrial controls, I came across @Walker Reynolds and Intellic Integration and immediately knew this is where we needed to go. Our manufacturing works very well, but most of our existing machines were built in the 1970s and haven't been updated since, just maintained. As we launch a new product line I am trying to move our company towards 4.0 concepts. Reception has been very positive so far.

My biggest gripe coming from my microcontroller background is how closed the industrial controls landscape is! It's infuriating trying to spec out equipment and software and not being able to get pricing and good specifications about how different pieces will play with each other. I'm really hoping the 4.0 openness will start to change a lot of these things.","","üíØ (1),üëç (4)"

I have 25 years experience building, operating, and maintaining industrial machines and processes. I have moved around a lot and have experience in a wide range of industries ranging from naval/maritime to CPG to Food/Bev to Automotive. In my career, I have worn many hats - distributor, integrator, and multinational engineering manager giving me a lot of perspective. While I am considered  a RA expert, I have always focused on process and technology expertise which has allowed me to use many different brands/products in a variety of processes. I started this I4.0 adventure back in 2007 when I began a multiyear integration of various plants using Inductive Automation¬¥s old products (Factory PMI and FactorySQL). Later, we upgraded to Ignition.

Yesterday, I signed up for the Digital Factory Mastermind course. After seeing Walker¬¥s other videos over the past few months, I am convinced that this course is the fastest way to get ""on top of the learning curve"" and would recommend it to any one staring this journey. It will save you a lot of grief and help you avoid ""rookie"" mistakes. - and I am speaking from experience.

Currently, I‚Äôm working in a steel manufacturer and one of my major responsibilities is introducing new technologies to the plant. As I started my journey in IoT, I realized that it‚Äôs imperative to change the strategy for most traditional industries to survive in cruel competition. Companies refused to embrace the technology will be kicked out of the market, since their competitors make products with higher quality in more efficient way to fulfill the Customer Requirements precisely. So, I totally agree with the mindset is most important part of the digital transformation. (That is how I told to my team.) Thanks to the Walker, we found this great source to educate ourselves.

@lemberck  Welcome to the community!  One item in your introduction stood out to me ... ""RPA"" ... I have played around with UIPath, even got as far a BOT running against a demo Ignition system.  I have failed to come across a solid use case for RPA that would reside on a factory floor.

Yes, edge driven, yes report by exception, yes open architecture...  We are creating a proof of concept and very workable product for small and medium manufacturers to adopt and use.  But the magic is in our Profiles, and a marketplace to both share them and find applications/vendors that have analytics value against them.  We are shortly announcing a joint effort with the OPC Foundation, specifically for OPC UA, to create a marketplace for exchanging profiles.  While the OPC Foundation is creating many interoperability specifications for industries, we are creating the actual interoperability Profiles, the files that can be downloaded and applied in an application.  While CESMII will have an interoperability platform for others to use, we expect that leading automation vendors will adopt our Profiles and support them within their own product architectures.  So, that means you don't need to create data models that are different in every vendor's solution stack.  The CESMII Profiles will enable interoperability and instant value, in solutions with any number of vendor products.  It is a big goal, but we are also a Government Funded Non-Profit with this as our mandate.  We are achieving what no single product vendor can do.  And, for the price of a CESMII Membership, we are making the technology available for FREE at this time.   Walker, I think you will see value by exploring our technology in greater detail.  https://github.com/cesmii  Here is a demo of our Platform - https://youtu.be/j8fymUL55xk?list=PLtH3B3EUuDoqvih7Ka_WQKpKblGuB2gDs","",""

There will be high level profiles that are general enough for classes of equipment Pumps, Motors, PID Controllers, etc.  Then there are extensions to profiles that can have much more vendor specific information.  In addition to the basic data models, profiles will also have definitions of what they can be used for, as well as definitions for protocols that may be needed.  So a Profile can specify that there are these tags that have these meanings and you'll need an ethernet connection with this protocol to get it.  Ideally in the long run, when you install an analytics app, it will auto-discover the profiles (equipment) it will be able to run with and will then auto-configure itself after receiving permission to do so.  Our profiles will become an industry standard and vendors will deliver equipment with applicable profiles.  System integrators can also create profiles and may choose to list them in our marketplace, the place to find and exchange profiles, and discover the apps that will work with them.  I should also highlight that there can be totally private profiles, should Intellectual Property be an issue.  Again, the goal here is to make software fully plug and play.","","üëç (3)"

Then I went for University, where I graduated in Mechatronics and Automation Engineering, lots of hands on automation labs in that, usually with Siemens tech in HMI/Visualisation, PLCs, Bus-Systems etc.
During college I worked first in automation engineering at a nuclear research facility with Siemens technology, 
then later I worked at a Software/Communications Engineering/Control/Embedded/HMI-Oriented company, 
where I stayed after graduation as well. 
At that company I did:
- FPGA development for Software Defined Radio SoCs in VHDL (plus C for the processor side)
- Controls development for a force measurement machine (PID-Controller / CAN-Bus / C++ / Qt for HMI on PC)
- developed an adaptive filter for clock recovery of a decoder firmware at a video-stream RF-Receiver to allow for lower decoder latency (better filter needed to allow for smaller buffer), prototyping in Matlab and R, implementation in C++","",""

- developed a data science ""solution"" for haptic feedback system EoL data evaluation, starting form the raw data, and I set up a linux system, set up database, set up web dashboard, and did the processing/statistics/""data science"" behind it.
- developed signal processing for force sensors systems (that is, measuring force fused from several sensors)
- developed end-of-line calibration algorithms for force sensor systems
...
Then switched to a major corporation, where I work in R&D Control,  Software Development as well as Software Architecture, for electric car traction drives, which ends up in ... a really huge number of cars, working now mostly with Matlab/Simulink and C and CANape, classic automotive embedded gig I guess,

For the past 10-15 years, my üíØ  focus has been applying automation to generate ROI, mostly as the means to fund obsolescence and mitigation migrations. Starting in 2014/2015, I've been most interested in how we as automation experts radically change the lives of our operations teams and the business of the manufacturers we support. My POV starts with business performance, and while I still periodically hack in configuration and development my passion is business transformation.

Important to note, for the most part, we use a native Siemens driver to pull the registers and convert to MQTT with a gateway.  A very common integration is PLC --> Ignition or FactoryStudio via Siemens Driver --> MQTT Transmission in Ignition or FactoryStudio --> MQTT Broker.  The other option I really like is PLC --> WinCC-OA via native driver --> MQTT Broker ; WinCC OA still has some work to do but they are moving in the right direction.

Simulation is also a common use case, in a way to already interact with APIs of the twin, even if a physical asset is not yet available.

I'm Wolfgang. I've been developing enterprise software (financials, automotive, biotech, manufacturing) for the last two decades and specialize in solutions running on the shop floor since 2016-ish. I helped a manufacturer of solid carbide milling cutters to digitize their manufacturing processes from oder entry to mobile manual work logging to analytics and machine learning supported pricing of custom tools.

I'd like to learn how others build resilient, highly available solutions for the shop floor. Especially interesting to me is how people feel about primarily cloud based solutions and the convenience / data protection / reliance on 3rd party services / failure impact zone trade-offs. 
Essentially, I'm interested in how people deal with this dichotomy: While cloud based solutions offer a great deal of convenience and often work great, shouldn't we be very conscious about the risks they pose, too?

I had to replace siemens s5 plc by an industrial PC as my first engineering project and boy that was a lot of work, We had to create a bullet proof linux image that can boot quickly,  we had to work with Qt to make the HMI from scratch in C++ and we had to make an R script that calculated machine metrics for the maintenance and the quality employees of our client that generated  pdf reports. Now there are several Open Source solutions that might helped me do that quicker.

Decade and half back worked as trainee in a heavy Power equipment manufacturing plant for a period of 18 months.

Observed few problems
For Plant/Quality/process engineers spreadsheet was best tool to track and record  daily/weekly/monthly activities, consolidation them was a daunting task  and it's the same today.
ERP is an alien subject for them.

New gen plant operators feel the current job as sluggish, slow and its very difficult to motivate them as they are in smartphone gen and this requires work culture change.

Plant Operators with decades of experience  and close to retirement,  were unable to do KT to new gen workforce,  due to lack of tools and data.

I believe IIOT , Industry 4.0 will address these problems and also these skills will be a differentiating factor to my career.","","üíØ (4)"

The company is getting read for real manufacturing and for FAA certification of several products.

I am learn how to use PLCs but mostly I have worked with NI test and measurement equipment and I am not a fan of NI software or NI in general. I am hopping I can find PLC solutions and software solutions that can bring the entire organization into industry 4.0. Right now the company is about 100 employees, in about 3 years it would not surprise me if the comparny was more than 3000 employees. so, I would really like to find solutions that scale.

I hope to simultaneously be working on getting upto speed on and integrating edge enabled PLCs with Tatsoft or Inductive software solutions into the new production systems. Right now so few software solutions are working well for my organization. I would like to recommend to my management an entirely new ISA95 set of software solutions ERP, MES, SCADA and Field level solutions.

I am the technology lead for StackedFarm where I develop the tech infrastructure to run our vertical farms, automation equipment and everything in between. 
I'm an experienced PLC and full stack developer and I need to fully comprehend the world of IIoT so that we can make the best possible technology stack. I'm in the fortunate position of being able to build it from a clean slate. Its like being in an icecream store with 1000 flavours, so much to learn and choose. Some flavours cost 10 times the amount of others too! Walker Reynolds has been like  spotting a unicorn in the wild. Doesn't talk drivel. This community I'm keen to contribute to and I'm bloody happy find people in high tech industry.

I‚Äôve worked with PLC‚Äôs, HMI‚Äôs, switches, routers VPN‚Äôs and such, but I was always drawn to the IIoT. Of course,anyone doing research on IIoT is going to stumble across Walker and Intellic.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt stop with Intellic.  I continued researching and found many companies.  Kept coming back to Walker‚Äôs videos to cross check other approaches to IIoT.  Hands down, the Reynolds approach is solid and while others are looking to sell licenses, Intellic seem to really want to help the automation industry move to 4.0 and beyond.  That parallels me and what I want to do, hence, here I am.  Looking forward to this and open to any suggestions for success.","","üíØ (1)"

As for ML: We¬¥ve implemented Neural Network algos and Fuzzy Logic two decades (!) ago and enhancing its failure pattern recognition capabilities continuously. However, I do not believe in the hype around real (!) prediction of failures in complex machinery.

You may find that the people in this community view the OPC-UA a little different than you do. And that they find it unfit to be the backbone in an IIoT ecosystem.
But no worries, we will be happy to guide you in the right direction.

In school I conducted novel research in using electrochemical oxidation techniques to disintegrate persistent textile dyes and perfluorinated carbons (surfactants i.e. that non-stick coating on your frying pans). My best IIoT achievement was doing the field maintenance, calibration, and initial big data cleaning (python) for a reinforcement learning algorithm (bunch of PhDs did the RL part) used for the early detection of any one of the 60-some EPA-regulated persistent molecular pollutants known to exist in surface water intake systems. I'm a diehard Algonaut (yes, blockchain) and Pythonista. My favorite book is Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzche and favorite Netflix series is Peaky Blinders. I love pondering how I could make the world a better place for us all. Moreover, I've come to love the conceptual idea of this community. Second to last, I want to highlight the first @Walker Reynolds video that I ever watched (couple years ago), the one that prompted me to tread further and further into this community - https://youtu.be/0aWmrvHPmBs. Two weeks ago, I had scheduled my team to receive a demo of Phoenix Contact's (PC) PLCnext system. Low and behold, the PC reps had actually brought up @Walker Reynolds and Industry 4.0 Solutions in the call. Fast forward to now and lastly, I'm now in possession of a PLCnext starter kit and am thrilled to share this news with the community here.","","plcnext (1),4point0 (2),ismile (1)"

my name is Ron, I'm an automation engineer in my early 50ties working as a business development and innovation manager for one of the biggest electrical contractor in Europe. We are used to work with the tech provided by the big automation OEM's and ofcours, we do have verdor partnersships with them in the industrial automation and IT stacks. Actually, I've worked 15 years at Siemens, selling plc/scada/mes products and consultancy to 3.0 system integrators for bigger projects in none primary automation markets, like large infrastructures, etc.. I had the opportunity at Siemens to have good discussions to the productmanagement in Germany, also here, you learn about the dynamics behind this. I can assure you, while enjoying a couple of beers, I can share a view good stories on how not to close tech or function gaps in a future proven way, this ofcourse from a customer pov ;-). My first open architecture experience was with Simatic IT and later WinCC OA, the last one I introduced into the Belgium public infrastructure market.  The last 2 years I gained some experience as a project lead for some 'digital tread oriented projects' (try to use your terminology :-)), reasonable succesfull in getting insights bottom up, but having a hard time on getting information and adoptio  back to the workspace (70k employees) in an affordable manner. It actually hurts seeing available budget burned, delaying other hard needed tracks.
As a proude father of 4, I'm specially blessed with 2 daughters, native from Ethiopia. Because of them, I was able to experience first hand what a none industrialized and no middle class society looks like. So, I fully relate to Walker his mission. We owe this to our next generations.

I took IT experience + a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and went into Control Systems.

I've spent a lot of time doing site assessments focusing on the network architecture and building out road maps for what you have, where you are, where you want to go, and how to get there. I've been certified / have experience with most major SCADA platforms (Ignition / SystemPlatform / InTouch / Rockwell ME/SE etc) and have experience programming with AB PLCs (PLC5 --> ControlLogix).

I've done a lot of consulting with corporate IT groups and essentially been that IT/OT Bridge. I speak corporate IT and have many Cisco/VMware certifications & experience with Hyperconverged systems / building out Industrial Datacenters.

I'm here to continue to learn and to take things to the next level. I think there are a lot of companies that talk about I4.0 and attempt projects and things don't tangibly happen.  I'm in a position now where I can influence things at a local plant level, segment level, and ultimately the enterprise.

I‚Äôm leading our automation and industrial software business for our customers in China. We focus mostly on process industry (pharma, food and fine chemicals). For Industry 4.0 the core of our work focuses on getting the production orders from ERP, executing them in the PLC/DCS, and then sending the finished production data back up to the ERP or separate databases for further analytics and processing. (Yes that‚Äôs basically the area of MES but we sometimes end up with this setup before anyone even mentioned that word üôÇ  )
Since most of our business is in process industry I‚Äôm very much looking forward to the Open Process Automation initiative that will break down the silo‚Äôs that are holding back a lot of innovation in our field like devops, automated testing, ‚Ä¶ .  (Why can we do those things for a simple web app but not for a vaccine production line ‚Ä¶?) I highly recommend following their progress, and also people like Don Bartusiak from ex-Exxon who‚Äôs now trying to build a business around it.
Another topic I‚Äôm working on is mixed reality and the third paradigm of computing, which will allow us to put scada interfaces and workflow on our equipment and in our plants at the physical locations where it makes most sense. Skip Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta keynote and dive into some of the dev sessions to have an idea what capabilities are coming. In Industry many have already been disillusioned by the Hololens but the near future will be headsets with full-color optical pass-through like Lynx (10 days to go on their kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stanlarroque/lynx), project ‚ÄòCambria‚Äô from Oculus/Meta and probably Apple‚Äôs upcoming high-end glasses.
Always happy to discuss any of above topics!","","üëç (2),ishocked (1)"

Our SAP first Supply Chain Transition has been put on hold as they try to get it back on track by putting new PMOs on it.    Last week, I dropped a bomb to the CFO at an all-hands IT meeting, stating that Digital Transformation should be a familiar term to our organization, typical coming before an SCT transformation.  The dozens of SCT members have no idea what that is or who would be crazy enough to speak up like this.  If 4.0 doesn't resonate, I don't think it will get me fired; it would be the catalyst that likely forces me out.  You and Walker have been the best resource for strategic thinking, and I am thankful for that.  If it does resonate, I am going to need more help. I don't think we will be able to drive this through IT.  Walker once gave a presentation about how to present to board members.

I'm currently the Automation Manager at a pharma FDF manufacturer in Ohio, USA. New to the life science industry (<6 months). I was an Automation Engineer programming production lines for an OEM in the automotive industry (Siemens platform) and then moved to packaging (Rockwell platform) after that. My first experience in industry 4.0 was at my last job as an end user in the forging industry where I discovered Ignition and started connecting as many of our systems to Ignition as possible including our custom OEE solution that relied on manual entry. In total I have a little over 10 years of experience in Automation, about 3 years of experience with Industry 4.0 although very limited based on what I've seen here.

As someone born and raised in the Midwest I love the mission of saving middle class jobs and I know it's possible based on what I've seen in industry and in this community.

Sometimes people are surprised by the jumps I've made from one industry to another. Making it through the Ignition University training is challenging. I have found that the key to mastering a new subject is making sure one knows the words of the subject. Here's a recent post about that https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6897692427814006784

If you know anyone working on their Ignition Certification, please feel free to pass this along.

I am a mechanical Engineer by degree with a Masters in Engineering Management and have split the line between process engineering, IT management, and plant management. The past 4 years I have been working in Plant management/General Management roles.  I made the jump to plant management thinking I could get more technology projects moving but I quickly learned the day-to-day operations get in the way. I am looking to transition out of production and into a role where I can help companies deploy smart technology to improve overall business success. I am incredibly passionate about technology and have deployed at least 1 new system at every stop along the way.

  The Key to making an over unity Electric generator work is mechanical advantage. In this case the mechanical advantage is achieved by getting the electric motor that is spinning to be able to spin a quantity of separate vertical discs that are connected to devices that generate electrical current while spinning to generate more current then the electric motor needs to spin. One of the ways to achieve this without violating the laws of thermo dynamics is to exploit magnetic field effects. To do this,attach a horizontally positioned disc to a bar the motor is spinning. You then place magnets on the top of the horizontal disc that the electric motor is spinning in a way that makes it so while the disc is spinning around, the magnetic fields are pushing upwards onto the edge of the vertical discs they hit into, forcing them to spin, thereby generating electric current. To get the magnetic fields to only hit into one of the edges of the vertically positioned discs, just put a material under the vertical disc that keeps the magnetic field from pushing against the disc until it reaches that one open spot where the magnetic field can hit up against the edge of the vertical disc, pushing it into a spin. In this way, the magnetic fields will be forced to do work that the electric motor wont be doing. This is how it's possible to achieve an Over Unity Electric generator.
 Extra Note: If anyone uses my ideas for none profitable means great I hope it helps, but if they are used to gain profit in any way I want small amount of royalties of anything that comes out of it please. üôÇ  My e-mail is starfire7654321@yahoo.com

I got a start in HVAC automation as a controls technician (Automated Logic Corporation).  That started as the basic technician stuff and moved to IT/network support since it was all getting web based and they needed a network guru to interface with our customer‚Äôs IT departments.  From there, I moved into a role with a district energy system (central heating/cooling plant distributed via hot/chilled water to a city/campus).  My main role is IT, but I interface closely with OT.  I built an Ignition system for visibility to our plant networks in 2012, and have been adding to it since.  It‚Äôs been an important piece of our operations.  While I don‚Äôt consider myself an OT expert ‚Äì I‚Äôm familiar with most of the big industrial automation players.  I enjoy system architecture ‚Äì IT and OT ‚Äì and I find Industry 4.0 a great way to frame and talk about the goals.

I‚Äôve worked in a number of technical roles in my 30+ year career within Industrial Automation, (field services, tech support, application/system engineering, training and solutions architect).I‚Äôve also spent the last 15 years in new business development (systems integration/technical & process consulting) working across the U.K. and internationally. 

Worked in numerous sectors - Water, Chemicals, Oil/Gas, Steel, Refining, Pulp & Paper, Automotive, FMCG, Food & Beverage, 

I‚Äôve been steeped in the OT domain but as of May this year I joined Dell Technologies SMART Manufacturing Solutions team. 

I‚Äôve been keen to better understand the IT domain and now have the opportunity to bring together IT/OT for Manufacturers. 

It‚Äôs been a great to get access to specialists in Edge, 5G, ML/AI, Computing, Data Storage/Data Centres, Networking, Cybersecurity and Cloud. 

It‚Äôs great to be here.","","üëç (1)"

Cybus is a German software company and we provide Cybus Connectware, an on-premise solution for the Smart Factory data infrastructure. We act in the middleware layer and are strongly convinced that smart factories should be seen like big micro-service architectures which benefit from strong decoupling between data akquisition and data usage. Cybus has it's very special positioning very close to the IT, because we believe you have to make the IT your friend, not your enemy. With this goal in mind, our software is focussed on auditability, infrastructure-as-code and IT automation. We enable a DevOps like deployment experience for the complete stack from PLC connectivity, data preprocessing to data distribution.

Technology-wise, we are based on containers, work very well in high-load and high-availability scenarios on Kubernetes and we have only open interfaces, everything configurable via REST, data accessible via MQTT but of course also with connectors to many legacy protocols, databases, Kafka, the clouds...

Personally, I'm very much interested in the technological transformation that we are seeing in the industry and how IT departments start to take over responsibility over shopfloor data management. I believe data infrastructure as a shared service is the only way to make rollouts economically feasible. I'm also curiously observing how different players act, and both factories and suppliers simultaneously try to define the tech stack of tomorrows factories - when will they ever realize that it's a bad idea trying to compete on the gateway layer?

I am currently responsible for a system that (among other things) integrates power plant sensor data with customer demand data, weather and energy market forecasts etc. pushes the realtime(ish) data through a linear solver to calculate (and write back to the DCS) the optimal set point for our power plants, creates market orders with our trading partners for day ahead and intraday energy markets and potentially recalculates the optimal setpoint based upon feedback from our trading partners. I am here to learn more about the OT side of things, because the communication between DCS and cloud seems to be surprisingly difficult coming from a traditional IT centric software development background.

I used to work as C embedded developer, C++ embedded developer, C++ desktop app developer, API integration engines, web/cloud backend dev and I know some frontend frameworks (but I would not say I'm an expert there).

I'm looking for ways to utilize my wide knowledge and Industry 4.0 seems to be the best place for it as it both exciting me and has high demand and low supply. Thus I'm experienced from hands on writing of very detail oriented low level for loops and ifs conditions in different languages, high quality code with best practices TDD and SOLID and more to architecting web solutions in cloud, I want to step out of this role and take higher level role, e.g. like onboarding companies with new  technologies and mentoring their teams.

So I have two questions:
1. Is Industry 4.0 a good direction for highly experienced software developer with knowledge of software development cycle, project management and wide technologies understanding, but with little familiarity with industries line?
2. Is there a place to start a software company in Industry 4.0? Is it possible to compete with large corporations that work with industry decades?

New to Discord and IIoT University.  I've been in the automation game for the better part of 20 yrs.  Started as Mech Eng building machines and  ""troubleshooting"" controls.  Over the years I have taken on more knowledge, building up to SME of all things controls, mes, data and reporting for my previous company but they never quite bought into Ind 4.0/Digital Transformation.  Now in a new role/new company I've made my way to here to further learn the ways of Ind 4.0!   Loving the movement and totally inspired by Walker and the community.  My new company is placing data driven, smart manufacturing as priority and I have a great opportunity to help lead the transformation.   
Looking forward to learning more and contributing to the community.","","üëã (3)"

My name is Shawn Deggans and I live in Hurst, Texas - it's between Dallas and Fort Worth. 
I've worked in technology for 25 years. I've moved from working on web applications in the earliest days of the internet to becoming a cloud solution architect on Microsoft Azure. 
Recently, I left a consulting firm where I had worked for 4 years as a solutions architect to strike out on my own. I have a small company named Green Nanny LLC. I want to build up a practice in the Controlled-Environment Agriculture space with a heavy focus on small to medium sized growers. 
My technology focus for the last 3 years has been on IoT and Edge development mostly on Azure, but also using some products like InfluxDB, Chirpstack, and Mosquitto. I know C# well, and enough Python to create regression models, and I'm actively focused on learning Go. 
My most valuable skill is around working with people to transform desired business outcomes into tactical solutions. For this, I use the modern stack of Domain-Driven Development tools and interactive workshops to turn strategic business ideas into tactical architecture.

As I've been doing more and more in this space I'm realizing that I've been doing a lot of these buzzwords I've been hearing so just want to learn as much as I can to fill the gaps and better serve my customers.  Glad to be here, thanks!","","üëã (4)"

I an a EE by training, I've been working in Automation, on and off for the past 20 years, but non stop for the past 10. I'm a pretty competent industry 3.0 integrator, PLC, HMI,SCADA with an understanding of database systems. 

For the past few years I've been involved at various levels in Digital Factory/MES initiatives. I am currently working as a solution Architect.

I'm hear because I need more skills and knowledge to really add value for people I work for. 

They say if you only have a hammer everything is a nail. And I have been using Industry 3.0 to solve a customers problems. And I know that will solve today's problem but make it harder to solve tomorrows problem. 

I can't create an Industry 4.0 solution on an Industry 3.0 architecture. 

So I'm looking to learn enough to build an Industry 4.0 solution, and the harder part I'm looking to learn how to help people understand that.

And I know lots about HV engineering and power plants. Or I used to at one point.","","üëã (6),üíØ (1)"

recently worked to build a MES like application for our internal manufacturing process using Python-FLASK framework and SQL at the back end, however, came up short on the choice of technology and mindset of the plant-floor vs that of board, this led a search of sort towards transforming my understating of architectures necessary to build a solution that's reliable and easy to scale.

My background is as a Process engineer. At the moment I am the only one in our business unit that work in Power BI (we are just now implementing it) but we are creating a network within the company and I am trying to find where BI fits into all this and if Power BI is the right tool for that.","","üëç (4),üëã (4),üññ (1)"

"1096818722976563320","jpt5","2023-04-28T07:43:34.3080000+08:00","Greetings everyone.  I am John Paul. Over the past 15 years, I've been deeply immersed in the IT and networking field. I've held positions such as Collaboration Team Lead, Senior Implementation Engineer, and Senior Network Engineer, which has allowed me to gain extensive experience in working with Cisco Collaboration products like Unified Communications Manager, Unity Connection, and IM and Presence Service.  I was given the opportunity to acquire a few Cisco Certifications including the CCIE and travel the country deploying networks, data centers, call centers, and video conferencing solutions.  

One of my proudest accomplishments was developing an automated system for a large school in California. This system streamlined the configuration of Active Directory, Google Workspace, Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco IM and Presence, Cisco Unity Connection, Cisco Routers, Cisco Switches, and Juniper switches. I wrote the system using Python and integrated it with SOAP, REST, GAM, local Linux commands, SSH, Telnet, RPC to PS, and several other odd things to automate six different applications. To acquire the skills needed for this project, I relied on resources like videos, LinkedIn Learning, Cisco Training, and RealPython.

I was also able to program a directory and configuration report interface using mkdocs with markdown and diagrams. This solution visualized configuration and voice flows with the help of mermaid, making it easier to understand and maintain the system.

In addition to my Cisco expertise, I've also had the opportunity to work with Microsoft technologies and VMware. I've been involved in numerous projects where we transitioned clients from physical servers to virtual environments, optimizing their infrastructure and resource utilization.

Interestingly, I somehow ended up in industrial automation with a focus on biogas cleanup and conveyance. I have really enjoyed learning about industrial automation and controls along with IEC 61511 and many of the ISA standards out there. Diving into this new area has been both challenging and rewarding, and....down right humbling.  It is interesting to jump into a whole new world and be a newb all over again. Lol  

Lastly, I am highly addicted to AI and have been using every model I can get my hands on to make things easier for myself or to just make some really funny content.","","üëã (4)"

The main goal is to abstract the various instruments into a data model that can be parsed by type of sensor based on classification, temperature, pressure, and gas composition support.  I am building a library of sensors which includes the specifications and installation methods required to support Class 1 Div II Group A, B, C, D and note if the installation supports Non-incendive or explosion proof ratings in order to avoid the use of Intrinsically Safe Barriers.  Chat-GPT is helping me to build the database, data model, and viewer.  I would like to use the Model > View > Controller method with one service using python as the Controller for data validation and retrieval.  A separate python service using Flask as the viewer.  A separate service running mysql or postrgress to support the data storage.  I want to build my own API for this service using mkdocs and following the PEP8 documentation standard so the comments in the format of restructured text can dynamically build the API.  Chat-GPT has given me all of the code and information for this which is absolutely freaking insane.  

AI Personal Assistant: I am using Midjourney to create pictures of virtual assistants.  Chat-GPT to create tone specific responses in text.  ElevenLabs to convert that text to freakishly realistic audio, and https://www.d-id.com/ to upload the picture and audio to create a portrait video response.  

Example pictures from Midjourney, which are 100% made up, are shown and the sample introduction video.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740628284282503249/1102640620050317403/grid_0.png?ex=68df5859&is=68de06d9&hm=d95f4ea0a5aec7ff5e89e0b02fe755ce74057624cd5424ad0b70a01a0b6dfb65&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740628284282503249/1102640620490739774/7bb4-d713-409d-b168-c55107f51919.png?ex=68df5859&is=68de06d9&hm=4d3f2e13cc2f99917614a9b63e0922c3bd97f483a10a58cc1ac7443cd9087cd2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740628284282503249/1102640620880801812/0_2.png?ex=68df585a&is=68de06da&hm=165983188ea65cf46a2245c7d0be4c42cd0bf36eaf462d551410b30507ff9ad5&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/740628284282503249/1102640621484769280/HelloEveryone.mp4?ex=68df585a&is=68de06da&hm=af97ddca2f12450563be5eee6720cfa9aa9698213eeeca936599d4ccdeb316ea&",""

For the past 15 years, I've worked in senior management and sales roles for smaller organizations that did not yet embrace digitalization. At the same time I have been observing the transformative potential of industry 4.0 and AI. This disconnect has fuelled my desire for a career-change.

My immediate goal is to assume a new role in an organization actively promoting digital transformation and helping companies to become industry 4.0 companies.

Although I lack a technical and engineering background (my professional training as an electrician for mechanical engineering dates back to 1992), I'm eager to learn and acquire the necessary competencies to quickly become an effective member of a professional digitalization / integration team.

Recently, a friend introduced me to 4.0 Solutions and recommended Walker's videos, which provided me with practical and insightful knowledge of the subject matter. However, I'm still lacking guidance on potential paths, suitable professional roles and required competencies to make such a career-change work.

Therefore I am reaching out to the community and I would greatly appreciate your feedback. What is your experience? Did any of you successfully navigate a similar or comparable career change? Or do you know somebody who did? Could you recommend a suitable path, including suitable organizations and functional roles for such a career change?  I would greatly appreciate your insights and advice. Thanks and best wishes!","","üëã (2)"

You don‚Äôt have to follow it to the tee, but certainly covers most general manufacturers needs (imo). What I think really separates the UNS from digital thread is the concept of a node-ecosystem.

This is a deep and long discussion -- @CarrieWaltman  or @Vaughn Turner will reach out and they can direct you to the resource best suited to go through the crash course -- either internal or external.

Second, it feels like we are on the same page and good direction already, we use S88 for the decomposition of our systems combined with a standard functional categorization and apply this as said on the complete mechatronics keeping strict borders between the physical model (what a system or component is capable of) and the procedural model (what a system should do to execute a specific process) to keep building blocks fully generic and applicable in all unique systems.
Further, we are more and more in contact with customers wanting more data from the systems we build and we could help with in-depth knowledge of the system and process (in the form of a digital twin), however customers are varying and some have applications in place like ERP and MES, some do not have parts of this at all or build parts themselves.

Define Digital Strategy (the why an org wants to be digital, how data will become the primary commodity), digital architecture, minimum technical requirements. 3. Concurrently educate on what digital transformation is, what iiot is, what industry 4 is -- score their digital maturity and suggest a PoC that demonstrates value while continuing the education.  Too many vendors, partners and orgs put the cart before the horse -- it is critical to lay the foundation first.","",""

I'm currently writing my Master's thesis and I'm looking for people who I can invite for expert interviews. The core of my thesis is to analyse the specific challenges of implementing Industrie 4.0 use cases although enabling technologies might suggest a high TRL and, based on this, to derive a ""Industry 4.0 Use Case Maturity Model"". Exemplarily challenges could be: Limited Data availability (according to the criteria of 5V) or an Unsuitable Manufacturing Environment (e.g., light conditions during Computer Vision based inspections).

In total, I have identified 3 example use cases that I would like to analyse. I have already analysed corresponding case studies and now want to use the interviews to verify whether the challenges of these case studies I have identified correspond with current manufacturing expertise.

I am therefore looking for experts who have or had touch-points with the implementation of one of the following 3 use cases:
Condition Based Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment.
Autonomous Material Handling Systems (can be e.g. the autonomous recognition of products so that a robot such as a Celluveyor knows where to move the respective product)
Autonomous Defect Recognition and Inspection

I would be very happy to hear some feedback and am looking forward to an informative exchange. :ismile:

When I joined the Discord, I wasn't planning on introducing myself or becoming active simply because I didn't have anything useful to share. Reading and gleaning was my goal, but I have now come to a point where I could use some advice and guidance, so here we go.

About myself: I started off my career by taking a 2.5-year college course in Business Information Technology after which I worked as a full-stack web dev in a team of 4 for 3 years, developing a custom web app for a local accounting company. I then got hired by my current employer as an IT (don't shoot me just yet). This young family business is a small manufacturing company (~20 employees) that is currently transitioning from manual labor to automating tasks.

How I found Industry 4.0: I was tasked with finding an ERP system since all of our processes are running on Excel sheets, and inventory management was nonexistent. During this search for an ERP that would suit our purpose, I stumbled upon an interview that Walker Reynolds had with Erich Kimberling from Third Stage Consulting. It did not take very long for me to be convinced that this is what we needed. In one of his videos, Walker talks about building a technology stack and not an application stack, and this is what really caught my attention.","","üëãüèª (1)"
"1103787812244955207",".red.fox","2023-07-26T00:04:38.4040000+08:00","I am currently more focused on the IT side of things and making two of our applications (MES and ERP) communicate. I have barely any experience in the OT world (a little bit of S7-300 and ESP32) but will probably be doing more of that sort as our production floor becomes more automated. A lot of the content I find on System Integration (which I understand most of this to be) is focused on transitioning existing legacy systems and not so much on building new systems from scratch (correct me if I'm wrong).

We like to build all of our stuff in-house and learn as much as possible doing so. My boss is willing to invest in education, and this is where I would like to get your help and guidance. Where can I best learn how to build our application stack and the UNS with 4.0 best practices? I did the IIoT Mini-Course, MES Bootcamp, and MES Advanced - ERP Integration, but still don't feel like I'm ready to build this thing.

Much appreciated.","",""

You have no idea how excited I am to finally have found what I was looking for. But lets start from the beginning:

Due to the shortage of skilled workforce on the labour market i got into this business. Everything I know, which I deem is very little, is self taught. Still it was enough to get hired - almost a year ago - by a startup. OK, I actually got asked if I want to join the team by the CTO and co-founder (I think he will join shortly ;-)) as we have known each other for a long time and he knew I was into building my own server environment and amongst other things, leveraging smart home devices. I actually have a Masters degree in Environmental Sciences. So feel free to ask any questions regrading environmental sciences. My knowhow in systems integration may be small yet but I love to share what I know. My expertise so far lies mainly in the area of HMI/EDGE and Databases.

The last year was rough in an exciting way, long hours, a lot of fun, perceverence was a keyword ;-). Starting from knowing basically nothing in industrial automation I have learned a ton in this single year! What has bugged me lately is that I lacked a comprehensive context to put in all the stuff I have learned so far. The co-founders have years of experience in working for manufacturers on the plant floor integrating systems and working with ERP/MES and saw how they could solve the problems they encountered much faster more efficient and cost effective as they were allowed to. They are instictively heading ""in the right direction"". But they weren't aware of the whole context I have discovered thanks to 4.0 solutions.

Getting back to my first sentence: I was searching for courses/programs which are well targeted for ""becoming a system integrator""! It seems I found much more than that...","",""

Allow me to elucidate the concept of ""Report by Exception"" within the realm of your IIoT ecosystem. In this context, ""Report by Exception"" refers to a data reporting mechanism wherein the sensors within the system primarily transmit information only when there is a deviation or an exceptional occurrence from the norm. Instead of inundating the historian with a constant stream of sensory input, the sensors selectively transmit data when there is a noteworthy event or a significant change in the monitored parameters. This approach aims to optimize network bandwidth and storage resources, ensuring that only pertinent information is relayed, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the IIoT ecosystem. As for the setup of alarmings in platforms such as Grafana or Ignition, it is indeed an integral part of this concept, as these tools can be configured to trigger notifications or alerts based on the exceptional data reported by the sensors. Thus, the notion of ""Report by Exception"" encompasses both the selective transmission of data by the sensors and the subsequent setup of alarms or notifications to promptly address any noteworthy occurrences.","",""

i'm allen xu and have been content lately to describe myself as ""an operations guy"". i fell into manufacturing after graduating university w/ what seemed to be at the time, a paperweight (bachelors of science). i self selected out of the med school rat race and knew i was not interested in pure academia (research). 

through a connection, i found myself w/ a foot in the door to biotech manufacturing (vaccines, cleanrooms, etc.), then medical device production (electromechanical microassembly), and now, i am transitioning towards the next opportunity. 

3 years ago, i did not know industry 4.0 existed. i struggled w/ the observation of working for organizations w/ complex and innovative intellectual property... but somehow had operational practices that seemed to be from the dark ages (paper based quality management systems, resistance to instant messaging / asynchronous communications, a practice to hold meetings to prepare for meetings, etc...). 

having now connected w/ so many passionate and engaged individuals looking to implement lean, functional, and effective solutions to support operations, i find myself excited to build on top of the shoulders of so many change makers. looking forward to contributing towards advancing the adoption of smart manufacturing principles through community (collaboration at scale).

I have a job interview with a client coming up soon and so, can use all the encouragement I can get.  I am also very much interested in bringing manufacturing back to the US and in hopes of achieving this, I have started Small American Manufacturers Alliance (SAMA) in Clearwater, Florida.  I operate out of a small makerspace here and have started making prototypes of some simple, practical products such as a moving dolly, which I first made with surplus wood, wood saw, drill press and wheels I bought from a local liquidation supply store.  I later called on my AI friend, ChatGPT to help me write up a BOM and Routing instructions and I was amazed with the output, Will share this later, if anyone is interested. Lastly, I just became an American citizen last year and I feel we are very blessed to live in this great country.

I founded a company 5 years ago developing software for industrial automation PLCs, SCADAS, HMIs. Previously, I worked in system integrators with a small experience of 12 years.
I discovered Industry 4.0 due to my interest in studying web development, better understanding the connectivity between PLCs, SCADA and a web system, and perhaps a web MES...

I still can't understand the necessary information, how to take this next step up a level, beyond PLC and SCADA, go to web application and/or MES

I'm currently studying web system development, and looking for information on connectivity, node.js or node-red, opc ua or mqtt? I don't know.

I'm from Brazil, city Sert√£ozinho, in the interior of the state of S√£o Paulo.
I have experience in Siemens Systems, Rockwell, Spray Dryer automation, Fluidized Bed Boilers, ISA 88.

I am available to talk.

I am Digital Dairy. With over 40 years of experience largely in Operational Technology (OT) and more recently in the convergence of OT and IT, I've had the privilege to serve in various roles. I currently hold the position of Principal Architect - Operations for Fonterra, New Zealand's largest dairy cooperative.

My experience spans across a wide spectrum of technologies and systems including instrumentation, PLCs, HMIs, SCADA, Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM, inclusive of MIS and MES), and integration into ERP systems. In terms of scale, dairy is very asset intensive, we have 100's of thousands of devices  connected to approx. 2000 PLCs spread across 30 locations.

At Fonterra, we handle a mix of continuous, batch, and discrete manufacturing. I am well-versed with the S95/S88 standards, but I believe in adopting only the aspects that truly benefit our organization. As we navigate the landscape of Industry 4.0, I am keen to share my insights and learn from all of you as we collectively transform our existing architectures.

Please note that my username is Digital Dairy, reflecting my focus on digital transformation within the dairy industry.

I work at a small medical device contract manufacturer having worked for about 11 years in or around manufacturing.

I'm currently deploying our MES Platform (FactoryLogix)  while attempting to enhance the ERP (Oracle 11i) integrations.  For the 2 lines not in FactoryLogix, they're still using an unsupported version of Lotus Notes for context of the environment I'm working in. 
I accidentally found out about 4.0 Solutions watching a Walker Reynolds video about ERP and MES integrations a few days ago.  I'm learning more and more the problems I've always seen at the companies I've worked at with data structures was solved with data transformation.

Great question about helping your clients start their digital journey. We can all agree that rip and replace for any business is simply not feasible. Obviously factors like sheer cost, and the logistical nightmare of coordinating such an effort is not conducive to maintaining operations effectively. 

With that being said, we always suggest the same starting point for all clients. 

1. Define a digital strategy- this is a short 3 sentence statement on why your company wants to be digital. It should guide all your future decisions. 
2. Conduct an assessment such as a DTMA (Digital Transformation Maturity Assessment), or similar. This is an engagement where you assess the digital maturity of your business, by scoring your organization across 10 industry pillars, meet with 5 core groups in the organization to assess strengths and weaknesses, and growth areas, define a digital strategy, if you don't have one, define Minimum Technical Requirements (MTR) for your architecture and technology, and define a PoC. This should be compiled in a comprehensive document that outlines findings, and provides a road map forward. 
3. Start Small - The intended PoC should be to focus on the low hanging fruit, focus on a problem area for the client, and solve the issue with a quick win. The key is to win the results war, not fight the theoretical battles, and get mired down in 'what if' discussions. 
4. Iterate - Remember that one's digital transformation journey is an ongoing process. What you want today, is a function of what you know today, and as our knowledge grows, so do our wants and needs gained from this knowledge. 

As you said, there is no 'magic bullet' to solve everyone's problems, each business, facility, line, machine, etc. is unique and must be treated as such. 

I'd be happy to introduce you to some of our partners in Ireland that could provide some knowledge and assistance from their past successes.

I'm English but live near Stuttgart.  There's still a fair bit of manufacturing in the area - mostly related to automotive and power tools.  I see the manufacturing industry changing, and it concerns me.  A lot of the companies around here are very conservative, and do not see the need to radically change how they've been doing things for decades.  Even those that are may be doing too little too late.  I fear this will cost a lot of jobs here.
Anyway, I'm curious to see how others here are managing.","","üëç (3)"

Came across some of the videos and they really struck a chord especially how to sell Industry 4.0 internally. I came to my current employer as an integrator and saw such a large delta between where they were and Industry 4.0 , that I took a full time job with them to champion the cause. So far I‚Äôve managed to stand up 3 Ignition gateways a few Ignition edge gateways, and have in my budget this year to add Cirrus-link brokers and associated Ignition modules to get data into a unified namespace as early as possible in its life.

Unfortunately, the issue you've encountered at your company is all too common. The actual operations and workflows are nowhere close to being Industry 4.0, and the people in the organization lack the knowledge base to even know where to start, much less implement a PoC, or transformation initiative. 

It all starts with knowledge and learning. I would suggest pointing your folks towards our IIoT Mini-Course, at IIoT.university, it's free and covers the foundational knowledge, think of it as IIoT 101. 

Link: https://www.iiot.university/iiot-mini-course

Then, you want to make sure you have a digital strategy statement, a 3 sentence statement of why our company wants to be digital. If you don't have a digital strategy, Stop, call a meeting, and define your digital strategy. An example digital strategy might be something like, 
""We use accurate, unified, digital data and information to drive decision making, quickly, and in real-time. We leverage an infrastructure that treats all producers and consumers of data and information as nodes in an eco-system that interact with one another through a Unified Namespace.""

Since you are undertaking this yourself, I would start small, and address an easy problem first. Get the quick wins, so you can show the results.

This is a great place to learn and collaborate. I love that you guys are trying to achieve the Industry 4.0 Holy Grail: A fully integrated business made up of digital factories. Where everyone, and everything is plugged into the network. The layers of the business are integrated and operate based on data and information from all the other layers - in real time. Stakeholders know the current 'state' of the business - in real time. Stakeholders know the future 'state' of the business, also in real time. You leverage technology, such as ML/AI to collect and analyze data and information. ML will predict future outcomes based on past patterns and current state. AI recommends operational adjustments to improve future outcomes. Finally, stakeholders choose to execute, or not execute, those recommended operational adjustments. 

How do you achieve this? Through treating data as you primary commodity in your business. 

Those steps are: 
* Connect
* Collect - important note here, collect all data points, make no assumption about how or who will need to consume that data
* Store
* Analyze
* Visualize
* Find Patterns 
* Report
* Solve problems
* Repeat 

One thing most company's do is to try to eat the elephant in one bite. This is a crucial mistake to avoid. Start small, identify a problem that can get immediate returns in your pilot/PoC. Show a quick win, and scale. Too many times folks look at the steps to the Holy Grail at a macro level, we have to solve some huge problem at the enterprise level to show value. This is a sure fire way to get yourself bogged down in theoretical battles, and technical debt. 

We are all infants in our digital transformation journey's, because they are iterative processes. We don't expect our 1-year old to run a marathon, so you can't expect your digitally immature business to do the same. You must crawl before you can stand, stand before you can walk, walk before you can run, and run before you can sprint.

I have been offline for nearly six months becuase of major project developments.  As of last month, Walker asked us to make a commitment with online media content as experts.  That would also mean be an active member of the UNS community.  It is time to change course following the simple set of instruction.  Yet, they are not easy.  This will take work within changing behaviors and micro-habits.  I say micro-habits because it is the little things that make a difference in our lives.  So each day will incorporate simple goals of changes to correct online media presence content.  It will mean being mindful of unconscious thoughts and actions that may steer me away from these goals.  Once we do this for about six weeks the new habits should solidfy in a daily routine.

I am Thaha, a passionate industrial control system engineer working in the Middle East. I have 15 years of experience in oil & gas, metal industry, water treatment, and material handling industry. I am keen on open-source technology because it helps me understand what real digital manufacturing means. While working with  proprietary automation, many time i desperate  since they don't have an interest in implementing real digital innovation rather than selling their already built applications. I was involved in many use cases with reputed consultancies, but I was sad about the execution as they were not considering the practicality of the use cases; even they didn't know what was happening on the shop floor. They are simply earning millions of dollars without doing anything really required. I was searching for true IIoT learning knowledge via YouTube and other journals, but I was desperate with many of them. Luckily, I saw Walker's video recently, and I was in full joy that he clearly explained the actual digital innovation, and it matched my view. Then I went through the 4.0 Solution website, and I saw this is the real place to learn about current and new trends in manufacturing. I went through many podcasts (20) for the last week, and I realized this is my area and this is my place to learn more. I have many queries to clear here. I hope you will.","","üíØ (1)"

I am an electrical and computer engineer and I was working at Intel in design of server processor Xeon since I graduated (2020) until last year (2023) when I was among the group they laid off. Still working with them, I had the opportunity to execute a side project of automating a production line for empanada discs with my father in law and I fell in love with industrial automation. So when they let me go, I decided to pursue a career on this. I started my own company and I have had the chance to complete some automation projects for factories. I have become very serious with this and when I found @4.0 Solutions YouTube, I realized I was lacking a lot of knowledge, so I am eager to learn from all of you!","",""

I jumped into the industrial scene back in May 2023 when I joined a company in the carton manufacturing sector. That's when I first learned about @4.0 Solutions during the DTMA phase. Massive shoutout to the @4.0 Solutions crew fro their awesome support and to Walker for those helpful community videos. Been busy piecing together a Proof of Concept since then, primarily focusing on one line at the factory, and I'm excited to say that we have now reached to the point to start connecting all the lines and build a comprehensive unified namespace. I have adopted mainly an open source architecture in which I'll be glad to share my experience and insights to the community.","","üï∫ (2)"

I've an IT guy for 10 years who moved into Manufacturing IT (OT) at an electric Automotive company.  I worked there to implement and support a MES system for 2 years before looking for work elsewhere.  Where I got my current job as an OT Engineer.  (Mostly a systems guy.  I have little to no PLC programming experience, but have a decent hold on the communication side of things mostly from the FactoryTalk Suite.)  My current company has a homegrown kindasorta-MES system that was created a LONG time ago, written in .NET and C# and the original developer is no longer with the company.  

I'd really like to bring my current company as far as I can into the digital transformation... It's still not a priority for them.  We're basing our OEE off of spreadsheets the operators are filling out and it's all pretty much made up.  We have a lot of the requirements for able to bring in at least the data required to get real numbers on the OEE, but don't really have an IIoT platform to build off of.  Recently the plant manager talked about wanting to get Ignition which I'm trying to push.  

Anyways long intro, but I'm looking forward to learning a lot here and am excited to drive down the path of digital transformation.  I think it'd be really cool to become an integrator for Digital Transformation of smaller manufacturers.  I like being a part of a positive change for businesses and in particular like to see small businesses be successful.","","üëç (3)"

My interests lie in the spaces in front of the first data store. I am passionate about performant software, high volume/high frequency sensors, and edge computing/signal processing. If you try to sell me software, I will want to know which parts of the stack were written in what software languages as thats a decent determinant of where it will bottleneck.","","üî• (1)"

I work at Purdue University Industrial Engineering Laboratories as a technical research engineer. I finished my bachelors in IE at Purdue in December, and now I work here full time! During my undergrad I spent 8 months at Tesla doing FlexSim, data pipelines, and a lot of SCADA in Ignition. That experience totally opened up by eyes to what was possible in manufacturing. 

When I graduated I was given the opportunity to stay at Purdue and build a ""Factory of the Future"" in our labs. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to gain experience with all of the technology we have at our disposal, and make positive change to our research and curriculum. 

Our lab is early days, and we have so much to learn. We are a small team with a big mission of finding the latest and greatest solutions, teaching others how to use those solutions, and publishing research that pushes what's possible. This is going to be an iterative process, and we will make mistakes along the way. I hope to learn along side you all.","",""

As the founder of Quotation Factory, my mission is to empower small and medium-sized metalworking companies with cutting-edge digital and AI-driven industrial ecosystems. 

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a passionate jazz musician with a rich history of recordings and performances alongside renowned figures in the global jazz scene. As a composer of contemporary music, I merge my programming skills with my love for music, creating orchestral scores from algorithms inspired by natural phenomena.

Prior to Quotation Factory, I founded Synergio, a company dedicated to change management in Systems Engineering across diverse industries, including banking, tunnel building, aerospace components, and nuclear reactor maintenance. My journey in this realm culminated in the authorship of ""Start at the End,"" a practical guide on requirements writing and result-driven project management.

Today, I am frequently invited to deliver online presentations on manufacturing estimations, focusing on closed-loop systems, AI, and Autonomous Agents. My expertise and insights continue to inspire and drive innovation in the manufacturing sector.

Originally from the Netherlands, I have spent over two decades in Brazil, living near S√£o Paulo, the heart of Latin America's thriving manufacturing and high-tech development. This vibrant environment fuels my passion for innovation and my commitment to supporting the global metalworking community.","","üëç (1),üî• (1)"

Our SaaS platform has become the middleware for a powerful industrial ecosystem, connecting over 55 high-tech metalworking companies, especially those operating in High Mix/Low Volume production. Our primary focus is on enhancing the reliability of estimations across the supply chain. This involves transitioning from open-loop to closed-loop systems, and evolving from simple formulas to finite state machines, discrete event simulations, and predictive models. I hope to share thoughts and ideas here with like-minded professionals.

Industry 4.0 principles, such as cyber-physical systems and autonomous processes, are critical for our customers' success, helping them become reliable suppliers by doing what they promise. Adopting the UNS or similar event-driven architectures is essential for achieving this reliability and for advancing our estimation and enabling technologies to the right level of maturity.

To clarify, we don't build the UNS ourselves; rather, we aim to integrate with it as soon as it's implemented at our clients' sites. Additionally, I bring over seven years of experience with the Actor Model (specifically Microsoft Orleans), and years ago, the concept of the UNS piqued my interest due to the significant synergy between both architectures.

Looking forward to discussing and collaborating on these exciting developments with all of you!

I graduated with an associate's degree focusing on industrial control systems about 15 years ago and started my career as an industrial maintenance technician. 

I fell in love with the industry and learned all that I could working my way through different roles as an electrical/automation technician, control systems engineer, and project engineer. 

One day, I came across one of the Industry 4.0 videos and my mind was blown. I felt the same excitement I felt when I started my career and was fascinated by all the possibilities. After deep diving several more videos I decided I wanted to take my career in a direction that would allow me to get involved in digital transformation and build on my industrial control experience.
 I then joined mastermind to learn all that I could to prepare me. I left my role at a systems integrator and found my way into one of the largest tech consulting firms in the world. Sometimes I wish that I had made it farther into the mastermind program before I made this decision. 

As I came to learn more and more throughout the Mastermind program, I decided that I want my legacy to be aligned with my values and not with a company that only cares about one thing. I find myself disgusted when I am working at a client‚Äôs site with good people that don‚Äôt realize they are being taken advantage of and that I needed to make a change. 

I recently had an old friend reach out to me for help because of the trust I had built with them, and I decided this was my opportunity to commit to my decision and start my own company.

 Over the past month I have entered a new world of excitement and stress trying to learn and get this company up and running. I‚Äôm looking forward to the future and to continue learning with this community. Sorry for the long-winded post, thank you!","","üëç (4),üî• (2)"

I guess I'm a systems, automation, and process engineer these days. We build just about everything we do from the ground up.

I am an electronic engineer, graduated from Universidad del Valle in Colombia. For the last 20 years, I have worked with all the usual technologies in the industry as an integrator, configuring and programming equipment such as field transmitters, PLCs, variable frequency drives, HMIs and SCADAs of recognized brands such as Yokogawa, Siemens, Schneider Electric and Rockwell. In 2010, I started documenting my journey with these technologies on my YouTube channel ""eeymuc"". Later, in 2015, I launched a podcast with the same name, where I share experiences and knowledge about the industrial sector. All my content is in Spanish, so I'll be waiting for you over there. I have had the opportunity to train industry professionals in Central and South America for many years. Currently, I work as a consultant in Industry 4.0, focusing on two main sectors: multinationals that manufacture refrigerators and freezers, and water treatment plants.

Lenn here. Working in software solutions focussed digitization of metal manufacturing industry (mainly focussed on smart quoting / price estimation).

My focus through the years has been on digital manufacturing technologies I4.0 / Smart Manufacturing and a high level of know how in Additive Manufacturing of Metals (Laser PowederBed Fusion technology - if you have any questions, reel free to reach out). 

Have been responsible for smart manufacturing at metal supplier in the past. When I found out about Unified Namespace, it was the architecture I have been missing all my life. So the technology and architecture really got me interested. 

Have been investing a lot of my free time the last few month to gain a proper understanding and build some small solutions myself related to the metal manufacturing industry. From sensors and microcontrollers to open source UNS architecture for gaining insight in my own (hobby) jobshop (milling, turning, additive manufacturing and lasercutting) - mostly old machines and making them ""smart"".","","üòÉ (1)"

Machinery: We operate with nearly 300 machines.
Inventory: We manage a diverse inventory comprising approximately 2,000 different raw material articles.
Production Scale: We export around 350‚Äì400 unique SKUs, ensuring consistent quality and efficiency.
To keep up with the demands of a dynamic global market and improve efficiency, we have decided to embark on a journey to digitize our organization. After a comprehensive analysis, we have identified the formation of a strong UNS (Unified Namespace) as the critical first step toward this transformation.

We are reaching out to this esteemed community to seek your guidance and mentorship for the implementation process. We believe your expertise can play a pivotal role in helping us successfully transition to IIOT 4.0, enhancing operational efficiency, scalability, and sustainability.

Having done a few more web-centric, event-driven systems around enterprise IoT systems, I find the power and simplicity of Unified Namespace on open architecture fascinating.
My current goal is to sort out what parts do and don't apply to adjacent industries, in which I have client projects in:
- one client is part of the biz unit of a soda manufacturer who develops/commissions/buys the fountain dispensers and wants to find commonality in how to accelerate the time to market for these dispensers, as well as time to service. 
- another is the digital part of a biz unit of an industrial engine manufacturer, where this unit is responsible for supporting customer operations for these engines and the equipment in which they lie. 

There are a lot of similarities I find between these clients and mfg needs, but also significant differences, I think. For example, ISA 95 Part 2 seems like an inappropriate semantic hierarchy for these biz units since they are not dealing with mfg lines etc. 
Anyway, that is why I am here.","",""

And in regard to your opinion on ISA 95, I think there needs to be some clarification. S95 gives you a standard model of manufacturing operations from the perspective of the ERP. S88 defines a standard model for representing the equipment (or unit/machine). So you could define it as a cell, production line, unit, sub-unit, or workstation. S95 can incorporate S88 models to give you a full model from MES to IOT. So you could represent your dispensers and custom engine equipment in the same MES system. 


Is it perfect? It‚Äôs a great start, but no. Every manufacturing process is bespoke. Hell no two plants under one enterprise is interpreted or implemented the same way. It‚Äôs also very difficult to implement. It‚Äôs hard to find OEM machinery that are S88-compliant (not an industry-practice), so you‚Äôll have to invest first into modeling them in yourself. And that‚Äôs just at the low hanging fruit. Taking on integrating SAP ERP with multiple bespoke MES implementations of S95 is a whole other level of complexity.","","üëç (2)"

I still work in the same company, but now I focus on automation instead of R&D. I built the MES system, and now valuable data is being collected. At the moment, I am working on data analysis and improving integration with the ERP system. Right now, data is exchanged using text files, but I want to make this process better. I hope to learn new things here and also share my knowledge with others.
I have been following this topic on YouTube for a long time, and I find it really exciting. The idea of UNS caught my attention, but I still have some questions, which is why I joined this group. I‚Äôm really looking forward to participating in the mastermind and exchanging ideas with all of you!","","üëã (2)"

Finally getting around to a proper intro! I've been part of the 4.0 community for a year now and joined the mastermind group at the end of last year. Been following Walker since the beginning.

My background spans 15 years in metal fabrication - started as a welder on the shop floor , then moved to CAD engineering before getting into systems integration. I've mostly focused on quoting systems, ERPs, MES, PDM and CAD systems, but started looking into IoT tech and machine connectivity (OPC-UA/MQTT) since last year too - though most vendors in this space suck, to be honest lol.ü§Æ 

I run Sheet Metal Connect e.U. (https://www.sheetmetalconnect.com/) where I work with a small team of freelance devs. Lately, I've been focusing on working with the UMH.app üõ†Ô∏è

I also host the Smart Metals Podcast: https://smartmetals.transistor.fm/ üéôÔ∏è

Looking to meet other folks working in high-mix/low-volume manufacturing environments and always open to connecting with those who know their way around Igntion, Node-RED, Grafana, data bridges, etc.

I live in Vienna, Austria üá¶üáπ with my wife, while I originally come from the Netherlands üá≥üá± where I still visit frequently. I love PC gaming (especially Battlefield) üñ•Ô∏è and I read quite a lot of books üìö","","üî• (3),üëã (3),üíØ (1)"

I'm Ali Akremi, Shopfloor Platform Lead at a chemical company in Belgium. I manage a portfolio of solutions with my team, including Aveva PI, LIMS, and hopefully a future MES built on an IIOT platform to manage production activities. 
I subscribed to the annual program last November. Although I missed the UNS basic training, I'm now catching up through the 12-week accelerator program. I joined the program with two colleagues, Matt Northey and Daniel Liu, aiming to elevate our shopfloor operations.

Like many companies, we have major solutions such as SAP (a mix of ECC and S4 Hana), Aveva PI, LIMS, and Siemens Scada, but no MES, for which we still have to convince part of our management board to go for it. We face challenges with point-to-point connections and real-time data availability. Additionally, our IS team has ongoing discussions about the security aspects of the UNS setup, which conflicts with the good-old Purdue model they still reference(....).

I am an Industrial Digital Transformation Consultant at Schneider Electric
My focus is initially on telemetry for critical national infrastructure in the United Kingdom using the Geo SCADA Product.
I started as a consultant month after 24 years as an Engineer and then Implementation Manager.

Many of our existing customers are looking to do more with their Geo SCADA systems, only just realising data is king. 

Some of our Geo SCADA systems are over 1m tags with tens of millions of alarm, events and time series data. Some data is 25 years old. 

I'm somewhat new to all the AVEVA technology and increasing my awareness of it, PI is front and centre of what most customers want. Probably more so CONNECT.

During my 24 year telemetry career I took a job for 5 years and worked for an Pharma OEM and developed systems in Siemens, Rockwell - I know those far better than AVEVA! 

But Geo SCADA and me go back to when it was running on VMS and called SCX2, people in the development team gave me my job when I was an Undergrad in 2001! 

My main challenge is IT OT data Convergence and UNS is interesting but our biggest challenge is aggregating hisoric data and making it available self serve.","","üëç (1),üëã (3)"

After over 20 years working directly in manufacturing, we‚Äôve built a Unified Namespace (UNS) system that combines edge and server architecture in a smart, scalable way. Our edge devices run in Docker containers on local OT networks, capturing and storing data in a local database for rapid reporting and resilient operations. A centralized server instance ‚Äî typically on the IT network ‚Äî aggregates and synchronizes this data across the plant.

One of the core innovations behind our solution is a custom-built **asset framework** that streamlines setup, simplifies asset management, and enables repeatability across equipment and lines. This isn‚Äôt just about connecting devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating an ecosystem that can be maintained and expanded with confidence.

We‚Äôre not here to push one-off installs. While we‚Äôve worked on plenty of those (and with integrators who specialize in them), our real focus is **long-term plant support**. Maintaining a plant over the course of 5, 10, or more years presents entirely different challenges ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where this platform excels. Our system is designed to evolve with your operation, not become another forgotten install.

Looking ahead, we‚Äôre exploring a cloud-connected model that gives manufacturers the option to host their own databases and connect external data sources securely ‚Äî all while keeping control where it matters most.

If you're serious about building sustainable, future-ready infrastructure for manufacturing, we‚Äôre excited to connect. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîßüìà","","üëã (1)"

I am Adrian based in Bucharest, Romania.  For the past 8 years i have been architecturing/developing (soft) realtime, distributed apps in Erlang/C# and Rust.

I have been also developing for 2~ years  IoT/IIoT  desktop apps  (WPF/Winforms) and web based SCADA control systems for railway industry as well as HVAC. I have been using OPC DA (matrikon) to connect via RSLinx to Rockwell PLC's   , Schneider S7 1200 , HMI-s . I have also programmed PLC's (Siemens,Schneider, a bit of ABB)

Though i am more on the web side (backend) traditional development i love anything involving high traffic - message queues, brokers, websockets and IIoT is the place i want to be in the long term.

My ideal work would involve Erlang for distributed computing (actor oriented programming) , each actor representing a component on the factory floor , be it sensor, actuator/ motor / VFD etc üòÑ

My name is Jeffrey, and I have been a software developer for 3 years in manufacturing SaaS after spending the first 3 years of my career as a manufacturing engineer. As a software developer, I lead frontend and backend projects in web, desktop, and service applications. My specific areas of expertise are industrial device communication and data collection, analysis, and visualization. I enjoy working with many different technologies, learning new technologies, and leveraging my background in industrial automation to help manufacturers get the most out of their software.

As a manufacturing engineer, my primary responsibilities were to support and drive production improvements through digital transformation, data collection and analysis, and manufacturing system design. Eventually, I began working with industrial control systems and robotics. This led me to develop a passion for designing and developing software to solve problems in manufacturing and ultimately my transition to software development.

I‚Äôve currently paused my career in the hedge fund industry to help my father expand our US business.

Briefly about my company -  we‚Äôve developed the world‚Äôs first PLC programming language technology that can extract and convert low-level languages from different PLC makers into a higher-level, unified language. This gives controls and automation engineers a level of insight that was never possible before. We call it Machine Language Processing‚Äîsimilar to Natural Language Processing like Google Translate, but for PLCs. Unlike existing solutions that rely solely on sensor data, our ability to add data directly from the PLC provides engineers with far superior diagnostics and predictive maintenance tools.

I started my career as an intern in the steel industry and eventually rolled (no pun intended) into a full-time role in their OT department. I spent 7 years at that company before joining a system integrator.

Most of my experience has been in the SCADA/MES layer, particularly with AVEVA System Platform and VB.NET. Since making the switch to an integrator, I‚Äôve had exposure to a lot of new (to me) technologies and industrial environments.

Lately, I‚Äôve been focusing on UNS and digital transformation, trying to learn as much as I can. I recently took what I learned from both UNS workshops and applied it in a sandbox environment.

I‚Äôm a final-year software engineering student, and I started out as an intern at the same company I‚Äôm still with today. My first project was building an internal app to automate our fiber optic testing, which was originally done manually on the production line.

That project gave me a solid understanding of how things run on the production testing ground, and now me and my team have been given a much bigger responsibility/opportunity of building a full MES system for the entire company (i.e.: raw materials to finished goods). 

Industry 4.0 helped us pitch the idea of developing our own custom platform and got the approval! Since then, we‚Äôve been working on building tools/apps to digitize and organize production and quality control testing processes for operators and engineers. 

Our current challenge is carefully implementing a unified database/namespace (going from CSVs to Database).

On top of the technical side, a big part of the challenge is also cultural ‚Äî working closely with different teams, getting their input, and making sure we‚Äôre not just forcing a new system on them, but building something they want to use.

Driven by this belief, I‚Äôve made it my mission to study and apply productivity techniques in manufacturing, taking time to read and draw ideas from manufacturing pioneers such as Henry Ford, Taiichi Ohno, and Shigeo Shingo. 

I've also had a long-standing interest in computer science, and as I advanced in learning programming, I found myself asking how this technology could be used to enhance productivity in manufacturing.

my name is Hristo and I have 7+ years experience in the digitalization of manufacturing processes with a focus on data operations. My experience spreads across the board: data mining, data extraction, data engineering all the way to predictive analytics, reporting and a bit of GenAI chatbot development for operator support. I have worked extensively with Ignition and also have experience with Power Apps for process digitalization with custom backends. My career initially started in IT as a business analyst but I was fortunate enough to end up in Industry 4.0 üôÇ Previously I worked for Atlas Copco as Smart Factory Engineer and now I work for Jabil Healthcare. 

I invite you to check out my LI profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/hthristov/ where I frequently post about solving various challenges related to data engineering. 

I am passionate about the UNS concept and discovered iiot.university some 3 years ago. Since then I have been working on stepping up my game by thinking more about the bigger picture and systems integration for achieving a unified data landscape. I enjoy tremendously the content Walker & Zack create and it has helped me a ton over the years. 

Looking forward to connecting with the community üôÇ","","üëã (2)"

I'm Alex Bolton-Mijares, Automation Engineer at Stacked Farm based on the Goldcoast, Australia. I graduated from Griffith University with a degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering and have been diving deep into the world of vertical farming automation.

My journey has taken me through various roles - from game development/software development to metal fabrication and then to solar engineering, Ignition/Systems Integration, and now I'm tackling the unique challenges of automating controlled environment agriculture and robotics. I work extensively with Ignition for SCADA development and Python for data control, building systems that help optimize growing conditions in our vertical farms.

What really excites me is bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. At Stacked Farm, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in agricultural automation, dealing with everything from environmental controls to data acquisition at scale.

I've been following Walker and Zack's content on YouTube (absolute game-changers!) and am keen to learn more about UNS implementation and best practices for building robust Industry 4.0 infrastructure. Particularly interested in how others are tackling MQTT Transmission (UNS), building operator-friendly interfaces, and creating truly unified namespaces across diverse systems.

Looking forward to connecting with this community and sharing experiences about what's working (and what's not) in manufacturing's digital transformation!","","üëã (5)"

Prior to working on ski lifts my background for 26 yrs was in Super Computer operations/administration, Web Application Software Development,  DevOps, Project and Software Developer Management and CTO. After, the last startup closed shop, I decided to make a huge career pivot and moved into Lift Maintenance. I discovered a whole industry still using a paper based system with no data collection or operation insight from Lift PLCs, and absence of any sensor deployment on critical hardware. All paper work orders, annual maintenance, and operations inspections where just in a filing cabinet. I was able to work with management start a digital transformation by moving from paper to Limble CMMS for all our maintenance tasks and parts inventory management. We are now starting a two, ski lift test case for the winter ski season of building out our the connect, collect, store phase with adding an Ignition Gateway, Ignition Edge at each ski lift and using MQTT to publish tags from lift plcs, and deployed vibration/temperature sensors monitoring our critical mechanical hardware in the ski lift terminals. This will be the first time a ski lift maintenance department in our area will have real time monitoring of our lifts during winter operations.  I look forward to learning so much form this community and will have lots of questions along the way. I am excited about our team taking steps to realize a complete Industry 4.0 transformation for the lift maintenance department and bleeding over to the whole resort.","","üëã (3)"

I have undergrad and master's degrees from UofL Speed School. For 5 or 6 years I worked as a Controls/Apps Engineer for a small firm in Louisville Kentucky that primarily develops test and reliability systems for appliance manufacturers. After that employment I moved into a Machine Vision System Designer and Developer role at an electronics connector and cable assembly manufacturer in New Albany Indiana. I performed that role for about 6 and half years before moving into the Controls department at the same company.  In that role I developed a recipe management solution for an asset type with 150 instances spread across various sites around the globe. In that solution I leveraged the MQTT connector in the HMI to publish recipe change data to AWS IoT Core which triggered a Lambda that pushed updates to the recipe database. That caught the attention of the manager and director of the company's IIoT team. I am now in an IIoT Developer role. 

I've watched tons of YouTube videos related to UNS and IIoT for the past year and three months.  I've learned a lot and am still learning. I'm starting to work with others in the company to stand up our first two POC's. Now that I'm spending real time considering the problems we are trying to solve and the implementation details I'm coming up with questions for the community.
