We have rolled out LoRaWAN networks that cover entire cities.

The LoRa mesh is nice in that every node has a dual purpose, collecting sensor data and acting as a repeater. And then you only require one gateway into the cloud.

Thus if you require coverage in an area where the terrain or any other factor block coverage. You can just add a node to extend the coverage.","","üëç (1)"

"748304720644407366","svb0866","2025-09-15T19:47:22.4620000+08:00","As Per ChatGPT Short answer: very unlikely. It looks like an SMC (DO-214AB) body with no cathode band, top-mark starts with PJ ‚Üí that strongly suggests a PanJit SMCJ-series TVS (often bidirectional), not a Schottky rectifier.

How to be sure in 60 seconds:

Look for a band: Schottky/rectifier parts almost always print a cathode band on the body and/or the PCB silkscreen has a diode arrow. Your part shows no band ‚Üí typical for bidirectional TVS.

Diode-mode test (DMM):

Schottky: ~0.15‚Äì0.35 V forward drop one way, open the other.

Bidirectional TVS: open in both directions at meter voltages (it won‚Äôt conduct until tens of volts).

Where it sits in the circuit:

Across a line to GND or across a pair near a connector/24 V rail = TVS placement.

In series with power into a buck/boost or after an inductor = rectifier/Schottky placement.

Given your earlier find (‚ÄúPJ146M‚Äù mapping to PanJit‚Äôs SMCJ code table) and the lack of polarity marking, call it a bidirectional TVS (SMCJxxCA-type) unless your meter says otherwise. If you tell me the rail it protects (e.g., 24 V), I‚Äôll suggest safe drop-in equivalents (e.g., SMCJ24CA / SMCJ30CA etc.).","",""
