**That would be a 5,490,955,097,383 or $5.5T market cap.**

Bitcoins market cap is $1.15T so if it goes to $10T and SHIB hits #2 market cap coin.... then yes I can see that. If it replaced Ethereum's position which is currently #2 at $.5T or 50% of bitcoins market cap.","",""

When I first read it, it made me think that we shouldn't constrain ourselves to conventional or evolutionary approaches to transportation.  I think we've been VERY conventional, and consider self-driving cars very evolutionary, not revolutionary.  It simply automates the current processes.  We need to think bigger about lots of things, not just transportation (as a teenager I actually had some interesting ideas for multi-modal transportation involving pods and carriers that could probably still work today).  It also teaches us the importance of our increasing dependence on technology and knowing how to deal with disruptions.  And obviously lots of messages around ""functionalism"" and how segments of society value each other (Mike Rowe and I are very much aligned on this).   Interestingly I applied to a couple colleges that were  transportation focused - General Motors Institute (doesn't really exist anymore) and Embry Riddle.  It's still an area that intrigues me.","",""

Add in the wildcard regarding FSD (which if it doesn't get mainstreamed soon could turn fanbois into haters) and there's definitely a good bit of risk as a long term play.

I believe we're decades off from the technology reaching a reasonable maturity.  We're much more likely to have some sort of hybrid approach with semi-autonomous or dedicated/specialized routes for full autonomous.  As we've seen with the autonomous truck startups, investors love these pipe dreams of automation replacing everything.  They overlook the practical benefits of technology.  It's an ""AM / FM"" problem.  Investors don't want ""actual machine"", but ""fucking magic"" and its associated hype instead.  If anyone has ever worked with computer vision, they'll know how incredibly difficult these problems are.  It's so hard to control or compensate in the real world.  There is weather, dynamic conditions, obstructions, etc.

I would argue their ability to produce compelling products, bring them to market, and command a premium is the value.  They have basically created the prestige of apple products, but in a car.  They've learned to master technology better than others and it shows in their products.  Consumers like the unique experience of owning a Tesla.

I meant value in terms of an investment in Tesla in general.  It's not that they're not valuable, but valuable for other reasons.  Regarding autonomous driving, I think it's too far out for the technology to sufficiently mature and be in widespread use.  For example, most of the US population resides in the East where there considerably less favorable weather for the technology.  I don't believe this will deliver the value its hyped to have for the foreseeable future.  We've seen too many blunders and ""irrational exuberance"" in the commercial space where the economic case is arguably most compelling.  I believe more ""boring"" characteristics like manufacturing competency (e.g., cost, quality, output), product enhancements (e.g., range, connectivity, charging, ownership experience), and brand prestige are more likely to deliver the value.","",""

Now we see how much western economies rely on China.... because we are not making a lot of stuff we need. The electronics components shortage affected a wide range of industries and players on the market from automotive to OEMs and EMS. It is forecasted though that once new fabs open in the US, Germany, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, etc in 2023 then we will have a surplus of ICs in 2024, therefore, the auto market (EVs) can really ramp up. Until then, even if they have excellent models/cars on paper, production volumes will struggle, doubled up by worker shortages due to COVID or low salaries offered by Tesla in Berlin.","",""

I'm not buying Tesla Shares one way or the other but if I was in a position to  my view  would be,

I would want to hear that theses things are in development., but I would want to see what products are being launched at a product launch, i.e. can I order it now, or at least preorder and get it in a month or two.

The issue with robo taxi is the value of Tesla is massively different whether that is launched in 2025, 2030 or 2035.

And given previous statements, I would not like to bet on which it is, which is actually what buying shares in Tesla is, betting on when RoboTaxi's are available.","","üëç (1)"

The real problem isn‚Äôt the conviction itself. Conviction is good when you‚Äôre right. The problem is the lack of filtering. When someone delivers every idea with the same intensity, they‚Äôre essentially saying they can‚Äôt tell the difference between their good ideas and their bad ones.
This is particularly dangerous in technology and business. A leader who presents every passing thought as if it‚Äôs the next big breakthrough creates two problems: they make it harder for others to trust their judgment, and they make it nearly impossible for their team to prioritize what matters.
The best thinkers I know have an internal editor. They test their ideas before sharing them. They understand that conviction should be earned through testing and reflection, not applied as a default setting.
Think of it like a dimmer switch versus an on/off button. Good judgment isn‚Äôt about always being right - it‚Äôs about matching your level of conviction to the quality of the idea. Sometimes the right response to your own idea is ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs test that‚Äù rather than ‚Äúabsolutely.‚Äù
