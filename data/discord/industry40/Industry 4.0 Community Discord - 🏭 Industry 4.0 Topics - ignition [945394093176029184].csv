```py
import time
import traceback
# ************************************ DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE *****************************************
def error_log(func):     # Wrapper function log error writing (add above function call)
    def errorCheck(*args, **kwargs): 
        try:
            retval = func(*args,**kwargs)
            return retval
        except Exception as Argument:
            logger = system.util.getLogger(str(Argument))
            logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
            print(traceback.format_exc())
    return errorCheck
def timeit(func):
    def timed(*args,**kwargs):
        beg_ts = time.time()
        retval = func(*args,**kwargs)
        end_ts = time.time()
        print(""elapsed time: %f"" % (end_ts - beg_ts))
        return retval
    return timed
# ************************************ DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE *****************************************
```

We apply these decorators to our functions easily with:
```py
@timeit # Apply timer wrapper to our function
@error_log # Apply log error capture
def someFunction(arg1,arg2,arg3):
    # do stuff
    pass
```
If the function is successful, it will return the value and print time taken to output console, if its not it will print and log the error to the Ignition Log wrapper.

An example error would be 
```py
someFunction()

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<module:scripting>"", line 17, in wrapper
TypeError: someFunction() takes exactly 3 arguments (0 given)

elapsed time: 0.002000

As everyone has stated, there is nothing wrong with using ignition historian to support an application and show useful data over time. There is however a trade off of the abstraction layer created by the Ignition system to store the data and read it back out (by ignition). Making it ""as simple as clicking the history checkbox"" means that the application does the brunt of the work for keying, assigning and CRUD operations on the historian DB

2. Having a more traditional standalone historian with additional built in capabilities for analyzing data that is being collected, provides even more benefit. 
     Think of it like the difference between SQLite and a traditional database MSSQL, MySQL, PostGreSQL, etc.

3. The other problem presented with using an embedded solution is that it may not (doesn't in this case) make it easy for other applications to access and use the data. Look for a  historian that can handle multiple input streams and have its own output stream.","","üëç (1)"

The protocol options for MES are MQTT, OPC-UA or SQL. There are silos of PLCs on an isolated networks and no localized on-premise server. (only a regional data center)

I have 2 main ideas:
1) Ignition Edge reads PLC data and sends MQTT messages up to a MQTT broker at regional data center. MES consumes via MQTT
2) Ignition Edge reads PLC data and sends data up to a gateway node at the regional data center via the gateway network. MES consumes via OPC-UA

I think #2 I like best because the gateway network goes thru the store and forward engine so won't lose data when connection is lost between plant and regional data center. Also I'm assuming the gateway network would scale better than MQTT messages as the internal guts of Ignition handles the data exchange between edge and data center. via that network. It seems MQTT we need a bunch of individual Cirrus Logic calls via event scripting and will end up crashing and burning at some point.

Most CNCs are implementations of Fanuc, Siemens, or Mitsubishi controls.  For example, Mazak uses Mitsubishi.  Makino, Murata, and Nakamura-Tome use Fanuc.  DMG MORI and EMAG use Fanuc or Siemens.  Because there is variation in controls, there is variation in connectivity.

With the exception of Siemens, it's rare for machine tools to have a native OPC UA server.  And even so, most Siemens SINUMERIK are more like the previous generation Siemens PLCs (e.g., S7-300).  Long story short, you will most likely connect via the native protocol.

[Native Protocols by Control Platform]
Siemens:  S7 comms
Fanuc:  FOCAS
Mitsubishi:  MELSEC

If you're lucky, you might have an MTConnect interface. 

Kepware has native drivers for these native protocols as well as MTConnect above.  These are all included in the Manufacturing Suite.  You can create OPC tags that will connect to registers (e.g., R1000.1) in the machine tools.  These tags can then be exposed as an OPC UA server for Ignition to connect to.  I would imagine a similar approach can be taken with other solutions such as Litmus.

[CNC] <- native protocol or mtconnect -> [Kepware] <- OPC UA -> [Ignition]

Some of the control platforms offer their own software-based OPC UA or MTConnect gateway product.  These can be used in place of Kepware.  Fanuc's FASOPC, as @jpmoniz mentioned, is an example.  These gateways poll the machine tool's registers over the native protocol and expose them as an OPC UA or MTConnect server.  

It's worth mentioning that these products usually don't account for the variation in implementations of machine tool builders.  For example, Makino and Murata implement Fanuc controls in very different ways.  As a result, what registers one polls over the native protocol will not necessarily be the same from machine builder to machine builder.","","üíØ (1)"

However, there are ways to get decent scripting performance even if you're out-of-proc.  Not trivial, but possible.  And if done correctly, very scalable. The problem comes with shared state, but within the same machine, that is mostly solvable.  I wrote some extensions to Rhino (the original Javascript engine for Java) to integrate the ThingWorx object model into it.  Initially it was primarily in-proc, but because of the abstraction we added for accessing properties and invoking services/firing events, it became somewhat more distributed.  

GraalVM has a lot of activity, and might be an interesting alternative to Python 3.  I would contend that most of the stuff you're doing in local scripts *should* be lightweight and not long-running.  Thus many of the things you could envision doing in Python 3 because of the rich data manipulation libraries is probably better done in lambdas or microservices and called from the scripting environment anyway.  Better scalability and isolation.

We are starting to use ignition in building automation. Previously we have used iFix and Citect, on local servers.

The buildings we manage usually consist of KNX control of light/heating/vav. Bacnet, opc/ua or modbus for communication to Ventilation, heat pumps, oil boilers, solar systems, pumps etc.
Very often the bacnet is a requirement from the client. Especially in jobs for the state or municipality.
There is great variation in how much equipment going into the scada system. A small building can be just a ventilation system.
A building I'm working on now consists of. 

8 ventilation systems
20 circulation pumps
12 energy valves
4 Heat pumps
1 Electric boiler
2000 knx components
Solar system
blind control
UPS controll
Reserve power
+++

So a building can have 50 tags to 10 000 tags.

Some of our customers have their own VPN lines between the buildings, and their own ignition server. While other customers want to connect to our ignition server in the cloud.

I'm think is a good solution to use an Ignition Edge Solution on buildings with more than 2-3 ventilation systems.

Anyone have any recommendations?

I guess the runtime might be seen as kind of a firmware, but because it runs on an OS (mostly Windows) and not on bare metal is it not called a firmware. SCADA does have kind of a driver. It has modules which can read//write form industrial devices (and provide interfaces to other comms protocols) which are very similar to drivers, but are not OS level drivers, since they use the devices in a PC which already exist and have drivers (e.g. the network card). The UI is one element of a SCADA, the other ones are a historian feature (a database like feature to log and query data). Alarms and events (which might be like notifications in PowerBI), you are able to implement scripts in all SCADA, you have some kind of recipie management.

With demo licenses from IA, I got those talking over a Gateway Network using Edge Sync modules to a full (demo) instance of Ignition with the Historian module. From there I could get the tag history out to a PostgreSQL database and review it with Perspective. The client liked the demo, but is in a fundraising phase and didn't want to spend - at the moment - the ~$8k needed to make the demo permanent.

I have been manually running scripts daily to export tag history data to CSV files, and know I could use the Edge Compute module to automate this.

In the spirit of I4.0, I do note that the Gateway Network is technically a proprietary protocol, but it is convenient to set up and it captures alarm and audit data as well as tag history out of the box. Still, I'd be interested to know what other historian applications people are using with Ignition, particularly Ignition Edge. Thanks in advance for the advice.","",""

Then query the sqlt_data tables for the specific id to get your value. 

I recommend also adding the timescale abstraction layer to your postgres and turning off the data partitioning. Looks like @zackscriven took a stab at this a few years ago.

If that full license is not an option, budget-wise, I was wondering if MQTT could be used directly from Edge (also requires an additional module, but less expensive) to some 3rd party historian function.

We have a power plant upgrade project with an EPC whose scope includes providing an advanced alarm system that requires using industry 4.0 concepts. However, they couldn't arrive at a solution that meets our requirements. So, I eventually pushed them towards an Ignition platform solution with Perspective, EAM, SAP Business Connector, alarm notification, etc. However, they are not able to handle this kind of integration and require a consultant to assist them in architecting the solution, training both the EPC and the client, carrying out developments for one plant, and supporting the EPC and client to implement the rest.

Kindly advise on a firm with Ignition experience (especially Perspective and SAP connector), SAP integration to Ignition, from an English-speaking country, and preferably with experience in power plants whom I can recommend to the EPC to hire. I am the user/client, but the consultant can only be hired by the EPC.

- To interface with RPI GPIO - I will write a python script to start an OPC UA server, and then update local tags (sensor threshold, start/stop etc.) based on update from main ignition server GUI. Is my understanding correct?
- A VLAN will manage traffic so all packets for IoT will be appropriately tagged
- At a high level - RPI collects data, transmits to Ignition, and ignition broadcasts 2 HMIs to 2 separate URLs (1 HMI for 1 application, and 1 HMI aggregating data across 2 other RPI)
- Assuming my RPI had HDMI out, could I also use it for a local GUI (same ignition GUI being broadcast from server?)

My client wants snapshot reports at the start and end of each production run. There will be some other integrate-over-time calculations developed as well, likely in the PLC code, but just capturing a set of real-time tag values at a given point in time (at the press of a button, in this case) was surprisingly complicated.

I was able to get it done using the 'script data source' feature of the reporting module, but that ended up taking enough complicated Python scripting that I almost wonder what the point was in buying a platform (so much for ""low-code""). The module is much more oriented towards querying SQL data over ranges of time rather than real-time snapshots. For the latter case, IA seems to promote the Transaction Groups feature provided by the SQL Bridge module, which is another license tier. In fact, the reporting module feels like it was designed with the express assumption that the SQL bridge module would be in place.

This has become more of a rant than a question, but any advice on how to do this better would be appreciated. For example, is there a SQL query that would return only the most recent record for each of the tags in a provided list? I'm sure there is, actually, but I couldn't even see where you would enter such a custom query in any of the reporting module settings.","",""

Sounds like you would be looking at the SQL Query Data Source or a Named Query. While triggering the report to run after the latest values have been logged by a script (possibly a tag event of a state tag?).

Without the whole story I cant say for sure but that's my quick thoughts. I have never attempted to use the script data source myself.

But you can definitely work on optimizing the performance of the Easy Charts. Firstly, assuming  the system meets all the hardware and software requirements for running the HMI and Easy Charts smoothly.

You could fine-tune the historian's settings to optimize data retrieval and storage intervals, which should help reduce the update delay. Additionally, you can add a buffering mechanism to store a small amount of historical data in the HMI itself. This way, the charts can display recent data points faster while waiting for the historian's data to update.

Leverage parallel processing and multithreading capabilities to improve responsiveness during data updates. However, it's essential to remember that real-time charting solutions tend to be faster, but they may not offer the same historical data analysis features as historian-based charts.

If real-time data visualization is a priority for your application, we can explore other charting components specifically designed for real-time data.","",""

Firstly, the PC running this HMI was underpowered, but the replacement upgraded performance by almost a factor of ten. While most things have gotten snappier, not everything has, implying there is optimization to be done.

I was wondering if this might be a case where slowing down the sample/update rate actually improves perceived real-time performance. I will have to investigate.

When you mention a ""buffering mechanism,"" can that be done with UDTs, datasets or something else within Ignition, or does that require an add-on solution?

This allows you to store historical data for specific tags over time. By enabling Tag Historian for the relevant tags and setting appropriate storage settings, you can create a buffer of historical data that can be accessed by the Easy Charts component or any other data visualization tool in Ignition.
 Also, you have the ability to work with datasets, UDTs, and other data structures. These structures can be used to manage and organize the data retrieved from Tag Historian or other sources, making it easier to display recent data points alongside the real-time data on your charts.

So you should be able to do this without an add on solution.","",""

Vision is based on Java Swing and thus requires Java to be installed on the client (This is handled in the background in later releases). In Vision the project files are loaded from the Ignition Gateway and stored locally on the client machine as a Java Application. Java handles the updates from the Gateway Automatically and reloads the project files from the Gateway. This is the client app that @Grendyl mentioned.

Perspective is built on modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Perspective projects are run within a web browser. When a user navigates to the project URL, the browser fetches the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) from the Ignition Gateway.

Personally I like Vision for HMI / SCADA applications and Perspective for SCADA / MES applications. But that's just me.

Vision is a lot more familiar to those who are used to traditional SCADA and HMI software.
Perspective allows for easier responsive UI development and runs natively on mobile devices where features like GPS and Camera access are available.

The Sparkplug pathologies, like birth storms, are a necessary side effect of that.  The need to use non-retained messages is another.  The moment you introduce retention of NDATA and DDATA packets, you have to give up report-by-exception.  Separating the model from the initial data values doesn't help in a significant way - you still need birth messages containing the whole data set in exactly the same circumstances, whether or not those packets also contain model information.  In fact, since MQTT makes no guarantees about message order, separating them introduces a race condition.

The difference between MQTT and Sparkplug B is with MQTT ensuring packages are received by each client is up to the broker where with Sparkplug B when a client comes online a NBIRTH or DBIRTH is triggered.

For example with my scenario I was trying to account for. I have a Ignition Edge gateway publishing tags to our local Ignition Gateway. The MQTT Engine module broadcasts those tags to other clients. What if one of those client goes offline for some reason and a tag that barely ever changes, changes? Each client is subscribed to DDATA and DBIRTH for the namespace, when the client comes back online and subscribes to that DBIRTH topic it gets all the data again. You can even manually trigger a rebirth as well to republish the NBIRTH/DBIRTH.

As for the connection between my edge gateway and my local gateway, you can enable Store & Forward. When the primary host id become unavailable all messages will be stored and sent once that primary host id comes back online","",""

Exceptions are relative to the prior state, so if you don't know the prior state, you can't have RBE.  Retaining a single message that says ""temperature is 40"" tells you nothing about the prior state of ""pressure"". If you retain that temperature reading you are implying that it is somehow sufficient to know the current state of the system, which it is not.  The birth message contains a stale prior state, but if pressure changed between the birth and the publication of temperature, then a newly connected client has no way to know the current pressure.  So, to avoid the implication that a retained DDATA message is somehow useful, it is not retained.","",""

There is already a mechanism in Sparkplug to resynchronize a newly connected client, so a failed socket results in a resynchronization.  Since a transmitted DDATA is guaranteed to arrive (assuming no disconnect), you don't need confirmation.  Why waste the handshake time?  QoS 0 allows you to pipeline messages.  QoS 1 and 2 introduce slowdowns of 2x and 4x network latency, respectively.  With MQTT, there's a third failure case - MQTT brokers don't guarantee that every packet will be transmitted.  They could be dropped due to a full queue.  In this case, the DDATA sequence number will be wrong, so the receiver will need to trigger a resynchronization.  That's a relatively rare event, so it's better to have the much higher throughput of QoS 0 and to accept the rare synchronization event.  Besides, QoS 1 and 2 make the full queue state more likely, so the resynchronization will occur more often.","",""

When it connects to the broker it can only see the most recent DDATA message.  Let's pretend that the DBIRTH was retained, which it is not.  The client has 2 pieces of information - the original state of the temperature and pressure, and the current state of the temperature.  It cannot know whether pressure has changed since the birth message, so it cannot know whether its view of the system state is correct.  In order to square this circle, the retained DDATA would have to contain the state of every tag, not just the most recently changed one.  And that is no longer RBE.  So, you have a choice - report by exception or retained state, but not both.  EDIT: just to be clear, this is not a general statement about MQTT or RBE.  It is a specific statement about Sparkplug.  The fact that Sparkplug sends all data on a single topic is the confounding factor here.","","üëçüèº (1),üíØ (1)"

If the metadata changes, the edge node can republish it with the retain flag.  Tooling and client apps can subscribe to metadata topics and get the latest info without any round trip to the edge node.  In terms of xDATA, I've proposed that the consituent metrics be expanded into retained topics/messages on the broker side.  This way, subscribers can subscribe to ANY topics and know that are likely they have the latest values.  This all relates to the ""multiple metrics in a single xDATA message"" issue.  Another option, but one that will take a long time to get incorporated into the MQTT spec, would be a ""multi-publish"" message type that lets a publisher publish more than one topic in a single message, each with its own payload.  I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one!

So I'm glad to see we're basically saying the same thing here.  Let's try and push the Sparkplug (and maybe MQTT) folks to implement changes to fix these flaws!

Your best bet would be to join the Eclipse Foundation's Sparkplug working group.  That would help both to drive change and to understand the devils.  I doubt you'll see a Sparkplug spec that breaks up xDATA into individual MQTT topics.  That eliminates any advantage Sparkplug brings in terms of bandwidth.  You might see xBIRTH messages retained in a future version, but that will do nothing for the rebirth storm problem, and it will introduce race conditions that I haven't seen a practical solution for.  A multi-publish capability in MQTT would do nothing for bandwidth or throughput if you're using QoS 0, so you'd have to justify it on the basis of QoS 1 and 2, which Sparkplug rarely uses.

While you are publishing an Ignition UDT, the Sparkplug specification treats this as a Template, which does not include the typical tag properties, like Scripting. The Engine UDT is ""owned"" by the publishing source so changes to them would not be reflected by the underlying tag instances. Because Engine converts the tag into a standard Ignition tag, you are able to perform scripting, alarming, history, etc., on those instances. One option is to create a local gateway UDT that references the Engine tags. If you continue to publish the edge UDT, you will need to create unique names for them. Hope this helps.","",""

On this one line we have two devices running; A Groov RIO grabbing data from the machine and a zima board connected to a PLC. The Groov RIO was publishing to *Line Name*/IMM/RIO. For the zima board I decided I would publish to *Line Name*/IMM/Zima, both to our local gateway but this caused my Ignition Edge on my zima board to constantly be getting rebirth requests from the local gateway (it seems). Our VP of tech told me that each device needs to be on a separate edge node id and in doing so he was right. Is this expected behavior from an Ignition centric infrastructure or must there be something we incorrectly configured? Also Why?

this is the part that explains it

> Sparkplug Overview
> 
> All MQTT clients using the Sparkplug specification will publish MQTT messages consisting of a topic and payload component. For the Sparkplug B specification, which is used by MQTT Transmission, the Topic Namespace structure is defined as
> 
> spBv1.0/GROUP_ID/VERB/EDGE_NODE_ID/DEVICE_ID
> 
> where
> 
>     GROUP_ID is meant to represent a logical grouping of Edge Nodes. This can be a region, a facility name, or any meaningful grouping of Edge Nodes within your application.
>     VERB provides an indication on how to handle the payload of the message. This includes whether the message is a birth certificate, death certificate, data message, command message, etc.
>     EDGE_NODE_ID is the ID of the logical Edge Node. This is often the name of the system running Ignition with MQTT Transmission.
>     DEVICE_ID is the ID of a device attached to the Ignition instance. This can be a PLC or logical grouping of tags that represent a physical or logical device connected to Ignition.

I'm still not 100% sure what a device would be but as in the quote above, in my case the device would be my PLC. Though I'm not actually taking values straight from the PLC I've created UDTs to represent the data coming from the PLC so I decided I don't have any devices ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","",""

MES is really a bunch of transactions and rules sitting on top of a data model.  When an MES has support for telemetry / data access protocol like OPC UA (or MQTT), one is limited to capabilities of the MES to transform raw telemetry into events that are congruent with the transactions.  For example, if what is exposed over OPC UA looks wildly different (e.g., machine cycle count) vs what the MES expects (e.g., production record id, container, serial number, lot, batch, qty good, qty rejected, rejection code), it can be challenging.  A PLC or SCADA may not necessarily have all this information.  At some point, the automation events need to conform to the transactions and rules of the MES.  Some MES apps are more sophisticated than others at doing this, but there are limits.

Okta can be setup as an OID or SAML-based identity provider in Ignition.  The legacy C# apps could be reworked with an Okta SDK or used as-is by leveraging the Okta Access Gateway. 

What's nice about Okta is its lifecycle management capabilities.  It can orchestrate and automate all the provisioning of users in various applications.

Ignition's Tag Historian is designed to work with regular database tables.  It has its own schema, compression, and partitioning.  It does not really make sense for anything other than module to query it.  It's very dependent on Ignition's internal data model.  If you've ever looked inside of other various process historians solution running on MS SQL, you'll have a familiar ""well, this isn't exactly helpful"" experience.

As Richard mentioned, Timescale is PostgreSQL + timeseries extensions (e.g., hypertables, interpolation, aggregates).  The relational functionality of PostgreSQL can be used alongside the timeseries functionality of Timescale.

You could use the Ignition Tag Historian module with this, but it would be no different than running using a ""vanilla"" relational PostgreSQL database.  The Ignition Tag Historian module wouldn't make use of Timescale's features.  It has its own special binding to the standard relational tables.

Apparently, some of have experimented with the tag historian module's optimization settings and converted the 'sqlth_1_data' table to a hypertable in Timescale.  It's not clear how well this works or is even optimal with Timescale.  A typical Timescale architecture would have more than just one giant ""tag+time+quality+value"" table.  Timescale can have multiple timeseries tables each with multiple columns.  This allows to optimize design to sampling, querying, use case, etc.  I would imagine all of timescale's partition and compression magic work better, out-of-the-box, in a typical architecture.

Another option would be to try the SQL Bridge module.  It's generally designed for logging complex events (i.e., rows) and not necessarily historizing tags.  It won't have the usual Ignition tag history experience and built-in visualizations of the historian module.  You could construct a stored procedure to interface with the timeseries functionality in Timescale.  It would be like constructing your own query.","",""

I would expect that hypertable writes would be faster than the regular tables.  Being a timeseries, it would have less transactional overhead than a standard table.  But, it's interesting that it's not significantly more performant than MS SQL.  I'm wondering if the ""chunking"" process is not as efficient when it's on just one very large table.

What I'm more curious about is the query and storage performance.  When it's one giant table with tags spanning in each row, how well does the partitioning and compression work?  There may be additional overhead to ""unpack"" the partitions and retrieve the rows of containing the tags and timestamps of interest.  The partitions in Timescale are time-based.  It's not clear if whether Ignition's historian table is optimal in this context.","",""

We're using the tag-historian to store all tags/data that we see fit in Ignition. And that's great to use their integrated graphs and queries etc to show data. But what I found is that it only applies to time-series data. 

For instance workorders doesn't really makes sense to store as a normal tag. Example. for every day/shift we have a workorder with PlannedQuantity, PlannedStartTime and PlannedEndTime etc, all the key parameters. Now I want to store all main workorder information + total energy used, total water, number of quality deviations and more for each specific workorder. To make it simple I would like to create a ""workorder table"" in the database. I have played around with transactiongroups but found them a bit clunky, so I'm thinking of scripting this as Event-data, to seperate from normal time-series data. This was done in the MES bootcamp. How are you handling this? Do you have scripts for storing to the database? Or are you storing everything through taghistorian? Transaction group? other? What's the best practice here?

There is a lot I could detail about this, but don't want to make a too lengthy post. Our MES is taking care of workorder data, but now we want to connect the data in Ignition to our MES into the UNS. That's why it hasn't been an issue. Feels like a super basic question but still a clear road forward has eluded me.","","üëÄ (1)"

You mentioned UDP.  I'm assuming you're referring to OPC FX (OPC UA TSN).  I believe B&R implementation relies on UDP for transport.  OPC UA FX, while based on mainstream ethernet tech, is more like a fieldbus protocol in practice.  It requires specific hardware support among the network interfaces and switch.  While these have began to show up in some network components, they're not necessarily implemented by the products themselves.  Ignition's OPC UA Client does not support OPC UA FX.  If it did, it would need to be on a host and network with TSN support.  OPC UA FX is more relevant to a field application than a SCADA application.

Depending on the network topology, there are also some things that can be done within the OS or hypervisor (e.g., vSwitch).  But, this probably isn't scalable with more than a few nodes.

I agree a NAT appliance or even a proper field switch (managed, l3, nat) would be the way to go.  This is the only scalable way to get the device and network to look ""normal"".","",""

Hi Everyone,

We have an exciting project in the automotive sector aimed at digitalizing operations, and we're on the lookout for experienced Ignition consultants to collaborate with us. Our client is keen on streamlining their processes, moving away from Excel-based systems, and harnessing data from PLCs to monitor production efficiency more effectively.

Here's a brief overview of the project requirements:

**1) Elimination of Excel Dependency: **Our client is seeking to transition away from Excel-based tracking systems towards a more robust and automated solution. They aim to leverage Ignition's capabilities to efficiently manage data from their PLCs.

**2) Real-time Production Monitoring: **The primary objective is to utilize PLC data to accurately count good and bad parts in real-time. This will enable the client to promptly address any issues and optimize their production processes.

**3) OEE Dashboards: **Additionally, our client desires comprehensive OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) dashboards. These dashboards should provide insightful analytics to help improve overall equipment performance and identify areas for enhancement. (**See attached images**)

If you're an experienced Ignition consultant with a proven track record in PLC integration, real-time data visualization, and dashboard development, we'd love to hear from you. Please reach out to discuss this exciting opportunity further and explore how we can collaborate to deliver exceptional results for our client: francisco.olano@spcpro.com .

MQTT communication was not part of the original SCADA project so we are trying to get an approach that minimizes development time on the Ignition side.
Because there is time pressure until startup we are considering the following approach:

1. add the Transmission module to Ignition
2. create a tag collection in a folder with all the tags that are of interest to us
3. publish all that is in that folder with a transmitter to a broker
4. the clients internal application would then get the data from the broker and do any needed unpacking.

We already have a local simulation setup that does 1-3.

It we had more time we could maybe do some other approach.

My question:
As far as I know Transmission uses SparkplugB. Sparkplugs documentation mentions QoS 0. That makes me worried that I can potentially miss data points/messages that are required of accounting.
Am I correct in this fear and what can I do to mitigate it?
Would it be so hard to mitigate that I am better of buying and setting up the MQTT Explorer module?","",""

Different MQTT QoS levels can guarantee at least once/at most once delivery of a message, but all other things being equal the robustness of the underlying infrastructure can be as impactful as QoS. Making the appropriate architecture decisions and hardening the infrastructure will be more impactful than adding modules/complexity imo. One approach I've found useful to guide the architecture conversation- consider a BC/DR scenario where the accounting app does not get the data (or consider the business process they're using today without it).

IU videos show examples where you create a ""tank"" UDT, and give that UDT a parameter called *TankNum*. You can then use the multi-instance tool to create several tank instances at once and give each of then a unique value for *TankNum*.

Now imagine I create that tank UDT, and several other UDTs, with another parameter called *SysNum* that indicates that this tank (or pump, or valve or whatever) exists within a specific system/cell number. I could then build up a new System4 by using the multi-instance tool to deploy all the tanks, then to deploy all the pumps, then deploy all the valves etc.

But when I do that, I tend to forget some UDTs, or there were field modifications made to System4 that I want to propigate forward. So to build System5, I just want to export the project for System4, change a single parameter value within that project from 4 to 5, and have all the UDTs within that project now reference that single *SysNum* value rather than the each having their own *SysNum* value that has to be set or changed individually.","",""

I'm gonna assume that by ""project export for System4"" you mean tag export for the System4 tags.

If the systems/cells always have the same structure, I'd create a system/cell UDT composed of tank UDT's (and pumps, and valves, and whatever else in there).
The ""field modifications"" you made to system 4 that you want to propagate to new cells, apply them to the system UDT template.
System 5 is just another instance then.

You can link your SysNum parameter of the child UDT to the parameter of the parent.
Screenshots attached show an example for a System 3 (SysNum = 3), based on a System UDT with 5 tanks.

Or skip the child parameter and link directly to the parent, but a bit less flexible.
You can also use tag providers, folders and reference tags, and create tags by scripting, and/or editing tag export JSON.
sometimes a UDT is not the ideal solution.

You put Transmission on an Edge gateway and Engine on a full-license gateway. If you do both, the Edge and the 'core' gateway can fully communicate with each other over MQTT just as they would over the Gateway Network. 

However, both the Edge node (with Transmission) and the core node (with Engine) can publish and subscribe to a broker, and can both send and receive messages.

Either it's not an ignition MQTT Broker or the 8088 port is blocked on the server. (I'd guess Zack is using Mosquitto or something like that to get it up for us to publish to.)

So as long as your MQTT Transmitter module connected to tcp://45.76.236.64:1883 you should be able to publish your tags to the Broker.
If you're wanting to see the tags from the DM Broker in your Ignition Designer, you'll just add tcp://45.76.236.64:1883 in your MQTT Engine module. as a server.  Then in Tag Browser, Navigate to MQTT Engine and You'll see it listed under Edge Nodes.","","üëç (1)"

Since in the MQTT Engine, we're defining a Custom Namespace for all tags (using #), it uses that **instead** of the SparkplugB namespace that exists by default in Ignition causing stale (red) tags.  We'd normally create a Custom Namespace if the topics **aren't** using Sparkplug and define those topics in the Subscriptions field.  Since MQTT Transmission publishes using Sparkplug, we don't want to define a custom namespace for those tags.  I'm guessing the reason we're running into these issues when Walker didn't in the videos is because we're using more recent versions of Ignition and the MQTT modules than what Walker was in the videos. 

I could be pretty far off, but that is what I've been able to make out of it from reading Ignition's MQTT Engine documentation.  But I do want to play around with it a little more when I'm not supposed to be working and instead I'm thinking of this stuff. üòÅ","",""

- When GroupID is set to ""Enterprise"" and NodeID to ""Site"", Ignition can read and show the tags in the MQTT engine, but the device always publishes the ""local hmi"" topic, even if it‚Äôs empty, and it doesn‚Äôt publish the COM2 port tags.
- This results in the ""local hmi"" name appearing at the ""Area"" level in the SPB message when it should be an edge topic.

Questions:
Is there a way to resolve these issues, or am I misconfiguring the setup?
If I start adding devices this way, will it mess up the hierarchy in my UNS?

Any advice or solutions would be greatly appreciated.","",""

I was also hoping to build a more generic-use Python script console though, since I so often use that for experimentation.

Currently, I am using two Ignition instances, one as a publisher and the other as a subscriber. I am sensing a few data points from one Ignition to another via our public MQTT broker, and I am monitoring the tags using the Easy Chart.

When I disable the MQTT transmitter in the publisher (the first Ignition), the values are stored and correctly updated in the subscriber side(2nd ignition instance) after the publisher connection is restored. However, when I disconnect the subscriber (the second Ignition server) and reconnect it after a few minutes, the buffered data does not appear on the subscriber side.

This indicates that while disabling the publisher works for storing data, disabling the subscriber does not retrieve the payload history. All of this data is using Sparkplug B (SpB) format.

Could you please provide insights into whether our MQTT broker supports this feature, and if there are any specific settings or configurations I should check to ensure that buffered data is received by the subscriber when it comes back online?

With QoS=2 and the clean session flag = false, in theory the broker should buffer the messages per MQTT spec. This is not the mechanism used by SpB. 

Instead, SpB uses the concept of primary host, and the publisher monitors the birth and death of a primary host (ie subscriber), and if the primary host disconnects from the broker, the publisher will start storing messages and will only send these when the primary host is back online.","",""

It's also beat out other solutions for Fanuc CNC and Fanuc Robots.  I have not encountered S7-1200 applications with intense requirements for an apples to apples comparison.

There aren't many companies that have done this. the benefits of the new protocol are as mentioned - symbolic tag names, auto tag generation from device, TLS for transport security. from a performance perspective, to be candid, it's not necessarily a FASTER protocol in every scenario than the old S7 register-based standard (the legacy protocol's large 960 byte data blocks really help with speed), but unless you have to move hundreds and hundreds of thousand element arrays at sub 100 ms intervals you probably won't notice much difference.

generally speaking, the BEST reason to use this new standard is: 1) tag generation from controller (so much time saved in register-to-tag mapping), and 2) because it allows a user to continue to use Optimized Blocks in the Siemens controllers. If you wnat to use Ignition with an S71200 or 1500 you must disable Optimized Block Access for the targeted Data Blocks, and other integrated PLCs or other Siemens systems may be relying on Optimized Block Access.","","üëå (1)"

Now a problem I see is that if I use a wild card (*) to a location of UDTs, when a tag changes in a UDT the tag change script does not fire off for the UDT, but for the specific path under the UDT.

A lot of ignition installs don‚Äôt use MQTT, so while I would like better integration to tags and UDTs ( Like a publish option in the tag editor, similar to how tag History is configured), I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for it in every license. Particularly when it wouldn‚Äôt even be used. 

On that same note, I use Ignition as an HMI, SCADA, MES, and/or IIoT platform. Depending on which scope I am using Ignition for, I need different functionality. The current Module based licensing approach makes this feasible. I don‚Äôt want to pay for all of the features of an IIoT platform when I am just programming an HMI. 

This is the same reason I don‚Äôt think that they are ready to converge Vision and Perspective into a single offering. I am going to get some heat for this, but I still think that Vision is better for HMIs and traditional SCADA applications. Modern SCADA, MES, and IIoT I prefer Perspective. Add to that that the dev environment for Perspective is nowhere near as polished as Vision ‚Äì they have a lot of work to do before they can kill Vision off. The inbuilt drawing tools are a good step, but they need to address a few bugs and UX issues too.

Their historian sucks, but rumor has it that is going to change in 8.3 so ill hold judgement until then but for now, QuestDB has PGWire support so it can use the Postgres ODBC and Ignition treats it like any SQL Database. 

The thing about Ignition is that a lot of people use it for a lot of different things. Currently they balance that fairly well. It‚Äôs not a perfect platform but it does each of its jobs better than most of the competition.","","üëç (2),üíØ (2)"

Limited Vision helps too if it is less than 5 HMIs.

When it is a full license, we keep the Gateway and Clients on the Controls network (and away from the internet) just like the HMIs would be. We try to keep the gateway in the PLC panel.

That way if the network goes down they can still run. If the controls network goes down the Remote IO racks and VFD Panels go with it so losing the gateway connection is the least of the worries.

In some industries, there is no SCADA or a traditional concept of it.  They don't really think of data in a time series way.  They think of data as discrete events or logs as well as aggregate calculations of those events. Their data structures tend resemble the backend of an MES or QMS more than that of a historian.

A lot of the big changes are under the hood.

All of the configuration is now in JSON files, allowing for better git integration. It sounds like the SQLite database is going away completely. 

The configuration files so have full support for secret vaults (they mentioned hashicorp by name). The configuration also supports configurable deployment modes as well.

The redesigned Gateway UI hides the fact that it is built on a fully exposed API that is extensible and follows the open API standard.

The initial launch of the historian is built into the gateway, QuestDB is a great addition and being built in they reduce the latency. Presumably this will greatly increase the ingestion rate. But even that is a superficial feature of their new Historian API that they heavily implied would be open to other historians, event streams, and databases in the future. 

Event streams adds immediate support for Kafka. But again, this is just the first implementation of a new functionality. Lots more coming.

8.3 is a major overhaul of the backend, time will tell but talking to the developers and QA team at ICC this is a bigger release than 8.0 was. But it mostly reduces the technical debt and allows for agility and growth moving forward.

Another big one for people still using vision is that they are changing the client communication to match what perspective uses. I have to play with this but from what I can tell that means that clients will use webhooks to get values on exception rather than the existing poll response method. Allowing for a much better user experience in Vision.","","üëç (2)"

So just to check,
You want to 
 - Connect to Shop floor Devices.
- Connect to ERP - What is the ERP by the way?
 - Collect and Normalise that Data into the UNS
- Store the Data in your Historian
- Are you planning on using Ignition to do some calculations, present some reports and visualisation? or a different tool
- Is this for 1 site or multiple?

Just in case you have Kepware already on site, and existing SCADA and an existing Historian
Try to sign up to the historian from Flow, they might push you up the list if they know you are building something.

And then the Big one why are you doing that, what problem are you trying to solve? What is the POC?
If you know that it really helps focus and direct projects
Maybe take a step back and do a DTMA and write out the Strategy, It makes it a bit easier to decide the correct tool? 

What have you on site? any existing SCADA or Historian to leverage.?

but 40k? the Ultimate  package is 33k 

But as @Rutger Van Aelst says, build what you need on the Trial, and then you can know the cost better.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945394093176029184/1289174954046128171/image.png?ex=68deff7c&is=68ddadfc&hm=803187987a7ed3711e60b5aba8f7b9cfed02edfd0f2be2567194336f17d68c0a&","üëç (2)"

You can start with the modules that meet the functionality you need. Personally though, in the last 10 years I have never found one of the pre-priced packages to be the answer.

A common starting point for me is one of the visualization modules (Vision or Perspective) and the Tag Historian Module. From there you can get started with Connect Collect Store from the plant floor. Utilizing UDTs to organize the data into a consistent and normalized namespace for use with the Historian and External Data.

From there, if we are talking ERP integration ‚Äì the Web Development Module is a great addition that allows you to create REST endpoints in Ignition that external systems to access.

The Cirrus Link modules come in when you need MQTT. So if that is part of the strategy, you will want those early.

I stopped using the SQL Bridge Module years ago. It caused more problems than it solved in my experience. Not because it had any bugs or anything, but it made it too easy for people who don‚Äôt know what they were doing to overload a database or device. I do all my SQL interaction with Tags, Named Queries, and Python scripts.

I have used the Reporting module extensively as a large customer required PDF Reports. While I liked it better than Crystal Reports, I really fail to see any value in PDF reports these days. So‚Ä¶ I try to avoid this one.

If you are starting at a site level, with a data oriented use case ‚Äì I would start with this and add things as needed.

For me personally, very short:

AVEVA System Platform I've worked with a lot until version 2017, through multiple m&a, still think it's a great system
+: objects having unique identifiers so a change in name or hierarchy doesn't break everything, more out of the box / addon functionality and widgets
-: windows only, more complex to set up and manage, AVEVA fans always shouting it's so much more powerful than Ignition without backing it up, and comparing Ignition with InTouch standalone which is bs imo, no public available pricing info

WinCC OA don't have any experience with (so purely from what I see online and talking to people, went through some docs but long ago)
+: .NET, supposedly can handle anything, large scale installs
-: m&a (very separate island within Siemens still from what I understand), steep learning curve (or so I'm told), pricing (or so I'm told)

Frameworx don't have any experience with (so purely from what I see online)
+: .NET, multiple scripting languages, transparent pricing, unlimited licensing model, sounds great at least on paper
-: looks dated, don't know of any installs myself, seems like a smaller install base

For now, Ignition stays on top for me.
Happy to be schooled in why others are better!","","üëç (1)"

That said, to your original point most SCADA systems have more consideration for distributed execution.  At the same time, the dividing line between HMI and SCADA has blurred.  When I think HMI these days I think more of a dedicated panel on a machine.  By that definition, many things like Optix are just as ‚ÄúSCADA-ish‚Äù.

I still see SCADA as an on prem part of the stack though so if we are talking about scaling SCADA platforms than I had assumed that the ""Bigger Box"" or ""More Boxes"" was the methodology.

HMIs that are ‚ÄúSCADA-ish‚Äù are actually something that I am really excited about and that is where I would classify FT Optix. So if we are comparing I would put it next to Tatsoft Edge HMI or Ignition Edge Panel.

I am not seeing any headless SCADA in my real world circles but I am hearing about Headless MES and IIOT Platforms. But the lines between these HMI, SCADA, MES, and IIoT are getting pretty blurry.... so it really depends on how you define them.

This is even leading to architectures where one might use Tatsoft Edge HMI or FT Optix on the plant floor and Ignition as part of the MES stack or as an IIoT platform.

Part of the issue in talking about Ignition is that there are people that use it in very different ways - Just on this Discord there are people that would call it an HMI, a SCADA, an MES, or an IIoT Platform.","","üëç (1)"

The built in option is Ignition Historian, If you want the timeseries optimization there are posts on the Ignition Forum detailing how to get it working with Timescale.

Other Options are the InfluxDB API, MQTT To Telegraf, Canary, or as mentioned above the Kymera  Module. 

You can use QuestDB as a Database Connection using the PGWire support or Telegraf.

Telegraf has an OPC-UA input plugin too.

Another options is to use the MongoDB Module and some scripting to capture tag change events.

You could use a SQL Database with the SQL Bridge or custom scripts.

Sparkplug-B to Snowflake if you are looking for a cloud option.

Or even more traditional Historians too, Ignition's OPC-UA Server could be used to connect to a lot of more traditional options.

I'm using the Cirrus Link MQTT modules to host an on-site Unified Namespace (UNS) within Ignition. Since we started building out the UNS, I've been publishing the namespace via Sparkplug B (SPB) and flattening it using the Node.js script Rick Bullotta linked here, with a few modifications. This setup has allowed other applications to access raw PLC data from Ignition alongside everything else.  
Now, we want to start publishing work orders into a specific topic with another application directly into the namespace under ""ent/site/area/workorders,"" which would appear under our MQTT engine provider and be brought into our UNS tag provider through a script. However, this approach creates a loop: Ignition republishes the UNS data into the same topic it‚Äôs reading to create tags.
One solution might be to separate the transmitters and skip transmitting in certain areas, but I'm unsure if that's the best approach. Any guidance or alternative strategies would be greatly appreciated.  We have published into a separate topic outside of the ‚Äùent/‚Äù topic structure for some other sensors that worked but seems like an extra step in the long run to just duplicate all the items we want in the UNS just so Ignition can read them.","",""

In my experience, many Ignition-focused integrators have limited knowledge when it comes to integrating Azure IoT services. This often leads to inefficiencies, as you must ‚Äúspoon-feed‚Äù them every requirement, ultimately wasting both time and resources. Instead of relying solely on presentations and demonstration videos‚Äîwhich may not sufficiently convince senior management‚ÄîI recommend moving straight to a PoC.

It‚Äôs worth noting that some ‚Äúdigitally transformed‚Äù integrators may immediately propose deploying solutions like HiveMQ or other costly brokers. These options may not fit your infrastructure, strategy, or budget. In many cases, a simpler, more cost-effective broker like Mosquitto would suffice. However, these integrators often remain fixated on a limited IIoT technology stack‚Äîcommonly including Ignition, HiveMQ, HighByte, or Canary‚Äîand rarely consider more flexible alternatives.

Moreover, the heavy reliance on expensive tools makes it difficult to justify their adoption in European plants, which often lag behind the U.S. market in terms of digital maturity. Ultimately, it‚Äôs best to be prepared for these challenges and to start with a PoC that validates your chosen approach before committing to any high-cost solutions.","","üíØ (1)"

Their business models are to deploy what they know with very repeatable service patterns. It does not necessarily factor in eventual ""co-management"" of the solutions with end users as well as their autonomy to extend, ideate, and build further solutions. Also, the business model for many integrators is to sell hours for projects rather than outcomes or technology strategy.

I think a really important thing that end users overlook from the ""choose which solutions"" or  ""how do I convince/justify..."" scenarios is having clear use cases and business outcomes defined. Yeah, it's technology and there is a desire to not single thread an architecture to a single use case. But, by POC'ing through a use case, it infuses the org's unique technology/data/people culture into the evaluation criteria. That knowledge is impossible to gain through architecture diagrams and product demos. It provides a better picture of what is required to deploy, maintain, up-skill, and scale.

Long story short. Step one is not to buy software or get caught up on justification. The focus should be on finding a strategy rather than choosing a technology stack. Wholly outsourcing strategy does not usually lead to great outcomes. Get your hands dirty with evaluations. Allocating resources, especially time, to evaluate is probably more important than anything. 

Could you dive deeper into limited IIoT technology portion? What, in your mind, is less limited stack and flexible alternatives? How are you typically approaching this?","","üíØ (5)"

If your main goal is to build applications for use on the shopf floor or close to it, Ignition is the straight forward choice. If you want to build a Smart Factory (I4.0) infrastructure (this is my understanding of an IIoT Platform), it probably makes sense to consider other tools as well. My next questions would be:
- What use cases do you have in mind?
- How to you want to handle machine conectivety?
- Where do you make data transformation to get a necessary degree of normalization?
- How should data be stored beside relational databases: Historian, Timeseries Database? 
- Where should additional logic live, e.g. for KPI calculation? Do you want to develop everything in Python2 in Ignition or do want to have separate services, that could live on even when you decide to kick Ignition out at some point?

A few likely explanations
is it is a US software, so it grew organically int he US first and is spreading out, so it is just not as far along its curve as it is in the US

So for the first few years they might not have been looking at Europe let alone having sales people speaking, French German, Polish , let alone ones the can understand many Irish accents.

there was also possible a bit more of a crowded market, I don't have figures but Wonderware, and Rockwell had a much larger share of the SCADA Market in the US, than in Europe. Siemens and Schneider probably adding a bit to that.

But I really suspect, ,from talking to US integrators , they felt ripped off and put over a barrel by Wonderware and their distributors in particular in a way I don't see speaking to European Integrators. I had a great relationship with my Aveva reseller, they really act like a partner in solving problems, both for customers when I was an Integrator and more so when working for an admittedly massive end user.

And Rockwell attitude to end-users is anecdotally worse.","","üëç (3)"

I have observed Ignition present at major automotive, pharma, pulp & paper, utilities, and packaging operations. I would consider is relatively popular. What the motivates the question? 

As to why it's less popular than in the US, here are some thoughts...

In large markets like Germany and France, there is a tendency to buy and/or transact locally. Having local producers certainly has an impact. Familiarity and localization is a bigger factor in some markets than others. In Germany, international television and film have dubbed audio translations. In Sweden, there are retirees that grew up watching American television.

In smaller markets, the buyers are more pragmatic. The Nordics, in particular, appear more comfortable adopting new or lesser-known solutions. They have significant industrial bases with a lot of automation and problems to solve. Ignition seems popular there. Other markets, particularly Eastern Europe, seem to be more conservative and follow the mainstream. This might be due to the lower cost structure and number of foreign-owned operations there. For risk-adverse multi-nationals seeking to deploy globally, it's historically been easier tap into the reach of Siemens. I'm sure ""no one ever got fired for buying Siemens"" has been uttered in many languages.

The make up of utilities and OT system integrators between the US and Europe is probably another factor. In the US, for example, there are tens of thousands of municipal water utilities. There is a whole cottage industry of small SIs that support them. In Europe, a lot of the utilities are national or regional systems, often privately operated. SCADA and industrial automation, in general, tend to be very risk adverse purchases and projects. The larger the projects, the more complexity and risk to manage. As a result, there have probably been more opportunities for integrators to ""take a chance"" on Ignition in the US than in Europe.","","üëç (1)"

We have a number users with more contemporary PLC or DCS solutions with native alarm instruction sets. Much of that gets exposed over the OPC UA server interface as A&C.

I do think it's interesting, though, for Ignition to function as an A&C server. It has a great alarm module.

**1.** I'd say so, yes. As long as you get a good understanding of the core components. You'll need at least a foundational understanding of all the topics (tag groups, tag history, tags, udts, transaction groups, databases and basic scripting to name some). The more ""hands on"" experience you get, the easier it will be to solidify the different concepts (which can sometimes seem abstract, depending on your experience) into actual knowledge.

**2.** Not that i know of. As long as you have an idea of the core concepts you need to learn, you could look online for demo projects, use AI to generate some mock up tests / project ideas for you, etc. *Ignition Exchange* also has a lot of resources.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

The totalizers onsite are odometer style, typically 15 or so. Using these totalizers we do numerous calculations and display on dashboards in the cloud for their people and also have plans to ""sell"" the data to their customers.  If the customers don't buy the subscription they still want the data to help learn about their process. 

Currently in the cloud, Canary subscribes to the data to store it via the MQTT.  Only issues with this  have been if the some totalizers might not change very often and since there is no data change there is no data in the historian to say get last hour of data. Which isn't a big deal just had to work with that exception in the code.

We then use Ignition and the canary provider module to connect and request the start and end data to get hourly, last24hr, today, yesterday, last 30days totals. To then run scripts to perform the calcs for the KPIs.

So here is the question. 

The specific calculations that are performed on each totalizer  are currently  being done in functions in Ignition and are running every 5 minutes to update.  With only two sites there is definite slow down with the calcs not the gui.  I tested just duplicating the sites calcs to 10 and the gateway was having a hard time. I am using async calls but just doesn't seem Ignition is up to the task. Considering finding a replacement for the calculations to send the data back to the Broker for perspective to still show the dashboards.  Going down the route for a POC where I converted the python code already in Ignition to a Python 3 and running on its own next to canary using the API directly,  but not seeing much improvement at the moment, but still early in development testing.

At the same time 8.3 is probably the biggest release they have ever done. Both In refactoring the backend as well as new features. 

The last biggest release was 8.0 and honestly that one didn't go over too well, it introduced a lot of bugs and after 1 one project I stopped using Perspective all together until 8.1 when most of the bugs were ironed out. 

8.0 also introduced a breakpoint in the upgrade process, which meant that older versions had to go through a multi step upgrade process to get there. 

My best guess is that these two things along with the memory of the painful (but exciting) launch of 8.0 is making them cautious of releasing too early.

IIoT is a bit different, specifically if it's just monitoring. That said, if Ignition is being used for the device drivers I wouldn't want to risk the connection. If Ignition is just hooked up to Kepware, then it's possibly a different story. 

As with everything, it's all in the details. I would love the addition but IA has smart people there, if it's not added yet I would believe that the quantity of people asking for it hasn't reached a mass that offsets the resources to implement.

If your application is a traditional Process Historian and Ignition is the SCADA I would be worried about losing some of those integrated functions... But Timebase Explorer does have some of that, it's just probably not going to be accessed through the Ignition Interface (Though technically you could build it with the API and say Apex Charts).

That said, there is a lot of power in both options and some trade offs to each. 

One would be to consider who else is going to work on it, and how adding an additional outside component can affect their onboarding.

Also depends on the rest of the architecture and what is being historized. If Ignition is handling the device connections there is something to be said for keeping it all contained.

But if there is data coming from many different angles, Timebase can connect and store the data without requiring Ignition as a middleman. 

I can make a case for both right now. My current stance is if it's just a basic Ignition Deployment to keep with the Ignition Historian. 

But if it's a larger initiative or a more integrated architecture the door is open to external ones - like Timebase.","","üëç (3)"

Does this assume the ""main""  ignition gateway ""IS your UNS"" in this case? Or the mqtt broker? Both? Curious to your vision of what the UNS looks like. 

When installing ignition I think start with option 3, 1 ignition gw and scale out when needed. Should be pretty easy to do if/when the time comes (right?) 

+1 for putting UDTs (and everything else!) in git. Do you use any specific tools to keep multiple servers aligned / enforce consistency?

I agree, option 3 is a very good starting point for most sites . Sometimes with 1 backend server. But sometimes the vision is to have allot of edge devices close to the machines, and I can follow those customers.

I follow your approach on git, only I won't use the save button for commits, that makes it a bit to messy in git for me, since I press save every 5 seconds üòÖ.  Keeping multiple servers aligned is definitely still a challenge. I hope this will get easier with Ignition 8.3.","",""

I am struggling on how to approach this data modeling problem so maybe someone who has much more experience can help me understand how to overcome this. So i have a couple of edge nodes where i run different containers like ignition where i am simulating different machines and al of this is for learning purposes. Now i am simulating different machines just as you would have on the production floor and all of these machines have different amount of tags available so for the sake of complexity each machine is different in one way or the other.

Quickly i found out that i probably need some common data model for all my assets because it can become overly complicated to maintain otherwise and maybe then i could built additional UDTs on top of that model, right? Just brainstorming haha.

How would this common data model look like if i want to model data at the edge?
Is data modeling at the edge something that we will see more in the future and is this decentrialized architecture good or bad? 
Do we have any exemples or does ignition exchange can provide any exemple projects?
Is it best to have mqtt broker at each edge node and then send data to the plant level broker and then cloud or what are you running at the edge?

Maybe i am overcomplicating this but it would be interesting to see how are you or even if are you doing any edge modeling/computing?","",""

Use case is Loss Tagging. and since in our plant most  contextualization to the data/information is coming from the shopfloor. We can easily create the pipeline/templatize and route to different SQL table depending on the parameter ignition posted to highbyte.

Any advice on below?

Im using below charts (Chart.JS)
https://forum.inductiveautomation.com/t/musson-industrial-s-embr-charts-module/91618

Im using API call using highbyte to get the data from sql for the dataset (binded in the data property of the charts). Im using bar charts

There's an arrow function/function call on the background color per each Bar that check if the data. The Y value of bar is the Cycle Time, and x axis is the Step number. I have other data on the dataset (Cycle Time, Step Number, Target, Tagged). Tagged means if the step number is already has Loss Tagging (using the highbyte method) .

Now the color is red, yellow and green. Green if the row cycle time Value is less the target, red if the row cycle time value is greater than the target and is not tagged, then yellow if it is tagged.

The challenge is that every time i update the database thru the highbyte call, I need the chart to uodate automatically and run the arrow function. I have set up that the bar chart is in an embedded view, and the submit button is on another embedded view.

1) What is the best way to refresh the dataset if the chart is on the embedded view? 

2) Is there also a a way i can re run the Function Call which is on the props.BackgroundColor of the dataset?","",""

As for Kepware, Having used Ignition for over a decade now - I have never once used Kepserver as the drivers for anything that Ignition already has built in. If it were a brownfield install that already had it I would use it but idk... It feels like one more thing to configure, maintain, and keep backups for. I have even done some pretty extreme tag counts from PLCs and there are issues at the high end but following best practice you shouldn't see them until the counts get into the 10s of thousands (depending on the driver Modbus, Siemens, Allen Bradley will have different limitations from each other). Im doing a project right now where we have 12,000 tags from just one of the ControlLogix PLCs for example.

I have a fairly large hub and spoke gateway network. 12 gateways at remote sites, all with different assets and data structures. UDTs of these assets are defined at those gateways and they provide store and forward service to a remote historian at the hub (along with alarm services)

This project has grown and the previous engineer decided to unify the model by creating duplicated UDTs of every remote gateways UDTs but as derived/reference tags. At a smaller scale this worked fine but is becoming difficult to scale. 

Initially I thought about just building everything and just referencing the remote tag providers directly but when communications are down I am unable to see the data structure. In the reference model, even if a remote gateway is offline tags all still live on the front end but their quality just drops.

What I‚Äôd do if they were read-only is write a script that adds the publish function to all those tags in the onChange event and make them read-write myself.

So your dilemma, from my perspective, would be whether you want me to implement the write functionality myself (don‚Äôt put slow shit in your onChange events, you‚Äôll learn some hard lessons about it later down the line if you do) (also, do not trust ‚Äúme‚Äù as a dev to implement according to best practices), or do you make the tags read-write yourself (maybe handle an edge case or two, maybe not) and save me from being tempted into creating some weird workaround?

Basically, because you‚Äôve already populated the tag structure and implemented the read functionality already, I‚Äôm going to want to treat it like every other tag. You‚Äôve made it too convenient lol.

I can also see an argument for enforcing intentional (responsible) usage of the publish function by making the tags read-only. There is something to be said about making something look different to communicate that it should be used differently.

I‚Äôd say, ultimately, whatever you choose, make your design decisions clear to your future dev users. You can‚Äôt stop them from shooting themselves in the foot in every case, but you can light up the intended path so those looking for it know where to go.

I hope that all made sense!","","‚òùÔ∏è (1)"

The first thing is to make sure there are proper commercial grade connections. It will be something like a fiber circuit marketed as a WAN (carrier/metro ethernet, MPLS) or Dedicated Internet Access (DIA). It will have an SLA and terminate on the carrier's backbone network. A lot of manufacturers have small branch offices colocated at their plants and have historically gotten by using broadband services. These are ""best effort"" networks for small business and residential. They are not appropriate for operations.

The next thing to consider is database design. Big transactional systems like MES and ERP can require periodic tuning. What a developer originally built schema and procedures for may not necessarily align with how an end user implemented and is using the app. Take a pareto approach of focusing on the heaviest utilized and poorest performing queries. Study the execution paths and learn where the bottle necks are. Work to drive down execution times and likelihood of timeouts.

The third thing to consider are the integration patterns. An MES is not a node on a fieldbus. It can be really inefficient to serially process many events in a short period of time. For example, if it's a high speed process with piece-level traceability, it may not be necessary to transact on each piece. Operationally, it may not make a difference whether the event was transacted with millisecond vs second/minute precision. It might not matter to the operator or process if the events are delivered together in a batch. The events could be timestamped at the origin, but they could be packaged more efficiently.","","üëç (1)"

Tulip has an MQTT option for machine datasources, which is one of the ways tulip can be event driven and feeds into their machine pipeline / feature. 

Tulip can also write to these data sources. Besdies that, the tulip player or local client is performing all sorts of other activities like rendering the interface and executing app and device logic on the edge. 

If apps get complex or use bad practice, you can start to feel it in the app for sure, but we kept our app purpose built.  I also built a custom widget to make the injestion of MQTT events -> visualization much faster. As always, there are many ways to build a solution and how you choose to build it can have implications to performance.  Generally speaking... calls to external systems can take >500ms, and this includes calls to your edge device... so I try to pick where and how I want to spend those ms, often times deferring to automations for time-insensitive tasks.

in the case of my app at proveit, i decided that i wanted the button push to give the operator immediate feedback (i demo'd this on stage, this button). the button was a single trigger action, but behind the scenes the automation performed a bunch of other CRUD+logic.. which made it appear snappier...because there is no reason to make an operator wait if its of no value to.","","üëç (1)"

That way, the redundant server is already processing the same events in parallel when connection is lost.

I have a project where we are converting a Movicon SCADA system to Ignition, the controllers they are using are Siemens S7-300s. The tags are being packed into DBs and transferred across in byte arrays.

My question is what is the most efficient/cleanest way to unpack those bytes into bits within Ignition? 

What I have done is create expression tags that reference the byte using the getBit function and unpack them that way. 

The other way would be to just reference the bit directly in the OPC item path DB120,B582.1, but will this put more traffic on the controller?

Any suggestions? Cheers.","",""

We used it as a faster path to certification than going through every video when speed was the priority (say an engineer had 3-5 years of experience but couldn't take the test without 40 hours of videos or the training course) - the training usually resulted in less calander days to certification.

I didn't take any training, but it was definitely a challenge to complete. I've sent them this feedback, but at least at the time of me taking the test, there were many areas that were ""nuanced"" and could be implemented many different ways.

The old Core Test has been rebranded as the Ignition Design Challenge. They claimed too many integrators were using the Core Test as a way to train people and it diluted the value of the certification, and taking way too much time for their team to grade. Yes you learn enough in the official training class to meet the requirements to pass the Core Test, and you get a certification for taking the class, however the class doesn't go into as much detail as you might need to complete a scalable Ignition project if that is your only experience with the platform. 

Personally I think IU is a great tool for people who are familiar with other SCADA platforms to learn how things work in Ignition, however it is absolutely terrible as a way for people new to SCADA or software development in general to learn the platform. The best tool for learning Ignition was the old core test, so it is a good thing they rebranded and released it for free, although you don't have the benefit of having it graded so might miss some efficiencies along the way if that is your first time doing an Ignition project.

Oddly enough the ""new"" Gold Cert is the same as the old Gold Cert, it is still a project brief you have to complete that gets graded. Based on the reasons for moving the Core Cert to a multiple choice test it is surprising they didn't move Gold to a multiple choice test as well. Yes there are more complexities involved at that level as you get into database queries and whatnot, but Wonderware System Platform tests have always been multiple choice and that is a much more convoluted system to work in.","",""

1. Do the Ignition Design Challenge so you can learn how to build a project, get familiar with the docs and how to search the forum.
2. If they are in a cycle where you have to complete IU to take the Core Cert then do that, but if you aren't required to do IU like they have it set up right now skip IU entirely.
3. Take the Core Test
4. Go through the Gold Test Study Guide and get familiar with that, or better yet get access to an old Gold Test and go through it to see all the things you need to learn for the actual test
5. Sign up for the Gold Test and knock that out.

Anyone who has done any Ignition work including database integration should be able to complete the Gold Test without a lot of hassle. It is probably 2-3 days of solid effort if you're familiar with the platform, and it doesn't require any huge leaps in terms of what you need to build beyond most customer facing projects.","","üëç (1)"

With the black background, the pump appears to fade to gray instead of showing transparent behavior. I've updated the background to light gray and added a ""Pump Stopped"" state for comparison. The distinction between Running, Stopped, and Stale data is now more visually apparent (see the first attached screenshot).

Transparency is just one visual technique to convey Information Timeliness. Another is the use of ""time delay"" bars beneath each asset to indicate how fresh the data is. The core idea is that the most recent data should draw the most attention. In the third screenshot, where multiple assets are presented at once, the visual fading helps to quickly assess the data freshness of the assets

Example use cases:

- Lab Sample Monitoring: In pulp and paper or water treatment, lab values might be entered manually on a schedule. If an entry is missed, performance tracking gaps emerge. Timeliness helps expose those misses.

- An analytics or data collection process constrained by resources (e.g. low RAM) may stop updating values without triggering any errors. In general, this applies to any situation where data updates are missed but no system failure is registered ‚Äî or made visible to the operator.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945394093176029184/1388212508770439188/Information_Timeliness_-_3_Pumps_States.PNG?ex=68df61e5&is=68de1065&hm=d2f776fc4546e0e2a9a62a4b2de0f669ddcefb9fe1eebabd9f3f3f5fdc79be57&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945394093176029184/1388212509072162947/Information_Timeliness_-_Time_Delay_Bars.PNG?ex=68df61e5&is=68de1065&hm=16b2617d29244e46ff2de63fab79762be4280ac8ab7e8ddf3011d85991bd909b&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945394093176029184/1388212509353312289/Information_Timeliness_-_Multiple_Assets_Screen.PNG?ex=68df61e5&is=68de1065&hm=da9c26d0d9c8ee63396907e0755c1732452063c1f1b72ec180dbee846bf6cac1&",""

In some situations I would start with Flow - Others Ignition or Litmus. Depending on the short term need and the long term goals. 

More often then not, Ignition is the swiss army knife, it does most everything that any of the other platforms do but eventually you will scale out of any stack that is exclusively Ignition. Depending on the cultural state, this may be a requirement - or it may be a terrible technical debt as those other parties may prohibit other platforms as Ignition shows that it ""Can"" do those tasks (for now). 

If it is an Industry and Site with Heavy Process Historian integration - Flow is one of the best starting points.

If you need more than the base Ignition drivers than Litmus is probably the best bet for connectivity as it can be the connectivity layer today and grow into it's other functions.

Ignition makes use of industrial data:

At scale, HighByte is a hub and Ignition is a spoke. HighByte converts raw data into information. It collaboratively and methodically remediates mismatches between data producers and data consumers. Ignition is a net data producer in process control contexts (e.g., HMI, SCADA). In industries with batch or continuous processes, Ignition will typically be a provider of telemetry data in its supervisory context (e.g., with alarms, with operator HMI inputs, with set points). Telemetry indicates what industrial automation is doing, but alone lacks operational context to support business processes and timely decision making. This is where transactional, historical, and file data comes in.

Can anyone provide any tips or best practises on mapping 20000 tags per site in to a standard tag structure for ignition HMIs 

PLCs are siemens s7300 and s7400s in 5 sites with poor structure and naming 

Plan is to standardise them into ignition standard structure however looking for some tools or suggestions on standardising the process

For example mapping UDTs from siemens directly into ignition 

Maybe use perspective instead of excel to import tags and so on 

Any tips would be appreciated","",""

The door opens wider with OPC Historian collectors as they can just read the tags right out of Ignition. This could include Timebase, Pi, Telegraf, etc.

And Off memory, last year at ICC they talked about a new Historian API to open the door to external and 3rd party historians while maintaining the same scripting and tag functions inside Ignition. I would expect options like Timebase, Canary, Influx, and Timescale at minimum but would not be surprised to see support for OSI-Pi in the future (even if 3rd party). Split between paid offerings and open source projects... There is a history of 3rd party modules built by integrators and open sources so I would expect some of that. 

There was a similar announcement for scripting too, it was one of the ways they mentioned they could open the door to other scripting languages besides just Jython... As well as allowing for 3rd parties to add support for their preferred languages. 

Really feels like this 8.3 refactoring of the gateway is leading to a much more distributed and modular Ignition.","","timebase (1)"

In v8.1, the tag historian is a narrow pattern between a tag provider and those underlying SQL tables (e.g., sqlth_te, sqlt_data_X_X). In v8.3, it's a more generalized pattern not tied to SQL and a particular schema.","","üî• (1),üí° (1)"

While Ignition is cool platform, developing anything complex (as external library or internal script) with jython 2.7 that doesn't even support type annotations makes me ""at least"" unconfortable.
We wanted to use mixed approach with .NET app that will handle all the complex stuff (we're much more experienced with C# than Jython and it's not dynamically typed). I watched Walker's MES Bootcamp and I would just replace Python package with REST calls to .NET API. I read this https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056397252-Python-In-Ignition where they explicitly pointed using api calls for using  python 3.

Can it be valid approach or am I moving in completely wrong direction?

I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to use EAM to distribute project-related files, like custom styles/themes (CSS), to Edge nodes. These files are stored locally on the Gateway (not embedded directly in the project), and it seems like EAM doesn't include them when pushing the project to other nodes.

Is there a best practice for handling this? Ideally looking for a way to maintain consistent styling across multiple Edge nodes without having to manually copy files to each one.

I've been struggling with this and tried:
- Jython 2.7.2 + Eclipse 2020-03 (4.15.0) + Java 11 - no luck
- Latest PyCharm - won't even let me set Jython as an interpreter
- Latest IntelliJ - also not working, even when friend of mine who is java dev was helping me 

The Java imports keep getting marked as errors even though they work at runtime.

Connecting the dev and prod gateways and creating a remote tag provider, in my eyes would not be done. You would keep your dev isolated from anything that isn't for testing. That is part of why the concept of a digital twins useful, the dev and QA isolation can pose a burden while developing.

In order to effectively test the HMI and tags, you will want to simulate them for the dev. My advice for Ignition without anything fancier is to: take the tags you want to simulate, identify a realistic range for the values (tag history could do this if its on), create a simulator CSV file (AI can do this these days). To truly test you would want simulated or test PLCs with logic that mirrors what you expect in prod, this is harder to do with Ignition simulator tags.

The enterprise question is an it depends answer, there are many ways to approach managing it. With 8.3 the enterprise deployment management mode will make this answer more clear as it will have more clear dev > testing > prod definitions and workflows.","",""
