We are a hands-on school, so I'm wondering what you think about using a low-cost ESP32 controller with LoRa as an edge device. I would use a Raspberry Pi as the LoRa Gateway. See links below. Inductive Automation is giving us free licenses, so Ignition will be part of the platform. We already have a big investment in Industry 3.0 hardware and software. These are 4th-year students, so I want to give them as much IIoT as I can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spE6IpOU-2w

Any input would be appreciated. I did watch your MQTT/IIoT/Raspberry Pi/Arduino video. So basically wondering how you think LoRa would fit in. Also, our College prefers to lock down WiFi, so LoRa would be more practical for connectivity.

@Walker Reynolds I've been playing around with this in the Cirrus Link modules in Ignition.  I know the Transmission module can buffer messages if there is comm loss to the MQTT broker, and the MQTT Engine module can direct these buffered messages to the historian whenever they finally arrive.  I also know Transmission can be set to publish buffered history in order, and the Engine can be configured to bypass the historian and instead push all the buffered messages through the MQTT Engine tag.  However, if I were to try and create a tag event on that tag, I would end up with missedEvents=True because of an event overflow.

@Walker Reynolds 1.  I saw on one of your YT video that you suggested Highbyte for IIoT solutions. Isn't that just another application as well? Why do you want to build on top that and not PI? Coming back to your couch analogy, is highbyte replaceable anytime if needed with something else?

@nadream you are not building on top of it -- highbyte is on the edge as an application (building asset frames/objects/udts to structure the data) and serves as an open broker if used as the UNS.  HighByte can be used as both a UNS AND an Edge Asset frame builder with MQTT client/transmitter.  Pi cannot.  Pi does not support failover to another broker (see my most recent post in #unified-namespace ) so it does not support the architecture you need to leverage as the UNS in the middle but it does provide the functionality to structure the information and data it creates for publishing back into the namespace (asset frames).  Highbyte, Ignition, FactoryStudio et al have application functionality AND can serve as the open hub.  More and more, we are using a standalone broker for the UNS (HiveMQ is our preferred right now) but we lose any form of abstraction functionality in the UNS when we do that.","","üëç (4)"

@Brad Frayo It is too early to tell -- I have some calls in to gauge the strategy.  The relationship with Aveva and Rockwell isn't great to begin with, though they will tell you otherwise.  FactoryTalk tools outside of Innovation Suite (which is just TWX) really are not all that great -- they are not best in class in basically anything.  Osi-Pi is a great historian but their rub has always been OsiSoft's business practices and their pricing (which is why Canary Labs has grown so much over the last 10 years).  Aveva, along with Siemens, are the only traditional companies in the space that are leading with innovation (and both really just started distinguishing themselves in the last 24 months eg. I4.0).  Rockwell likes to say they are -- but they really aren't -- their software products are overpriced, underperform and are about as closed as you can get.  From a 10k view, this acquisition makes little sense to me unless Aveva is going to aggressively go after Rockwell's software business and leverage the Rockwell Osi-Pi partnership to do it.  Aveva needs to get to the edge with hardware (not slapping an InTouch Edge label on Indusoft)... so, honestly, I don't know what they are doing here -- unless it is the aggressive move I mention above.","","üëç (1)"

@mdowdell my review might not be fair as I evaluated the platform around 18 months ago. I did not executed a project there but I had access to it and documentation. With that disclaimer, let's go: I did not like it. For a company the size of Siemens and mentioning a platform I was expecting much more. It is an open platform because it allows for connection with other systems, but it seems that the focus is more to be internally open. They want enterprise customers to pay for their own account and they will have access to several vendor products on the Marketplace. So basically you can create a product on the platform and have passive sales, with enterprise customers adding your product to their set. It seems like a modern version of trying to close your protocol so you can be locked with the vendor. You can add multiple add ons as long they are inside Siemens platform. I did not test their time series database but by the documentation it seemed quite simple to me, and not flexible also. You can do more with open source data bases if you know how to do it. And also for front end you would have to do it on you own, but now that they bought Mendix it seems to be more integrated. Buying it is also on the old fashion way. Not as clear as Inductive, which should be the norm now. You need to talk to them on the phone, get a quote, start a contract and so on. User and integrator need to acquire their license as it usually happens with SCADA. I hope this helps.","",""

So basically you can create a product on the platform and have passive sales, with enterprise customers adding your product to their set. It seems like a modern version of trying to close your protocol so you can be locked with the vendor. You can add multiple add ons as long they are inside Siemens platform. I did not test their time series database but by the documentation it seemed quite simple to me, and not flexible also. You can do more with open source data bases if you know how to do it. And also for front end you would have to do it on you own, but now that they bought Mendix it seems to be more integrated. Buying it is also on the old fashion way. Not as clear as Inductive, which should be the norm now. You need to talk to them on the phone, get a quote, start a contract and so on. User and integrator need to acquire their license as it usually happens with SCADA. I hope this helps.
@Mario Ishikawa This is a very good review -- I had a long discussion with Siemens at the SCADA Summit in '18 when they were first pushing Mindshpere... it was, at the time, the innovation suite for Siemens -- eg. they were going the Rockwell route with the platform.  Since then, they have moved more open with Mindsphere, WinCC-OA and their PLCs (with open protocol blocks like MQTT).  They still have some work to do...","","üëç (2)"

@Walker Reynolds As an electronics technician I also learned how to program PLCs, SCADA and code in general, back then with Pascal in 1995. Then I worked for a SCADA company for two years before my Computer Science graduation. Since then I have only worked with software for automation, and I have a system integrator company for 14 years. I was always interested in bringing much more than just a SCADA system, so I have usually worked with very large SCADA projects, like one remotely operating the largest private Power company in Brazil with over 30 power plants. With Big Data open source tools appearing I started to get very interested in how tools like Cassandra could be used to disrupt the market, as well as other things like encrypted REST APIs. Short story is that I ended up migrating from SCADA to this so called IIoT market, starting in 2014 but mostly after 2017 when I saw a presentation from IIC and became a member of ABII (which is like a Brazilian partner of IIC) and after 2018 when I joined PackIOT as co-founder.","","ismile (1)"

@Walker Reynolds We were required to complete a project of our own choice during the first year of my automation program. I was new to the automation field and I really enjoy gardening so I researched how one could automate a garden. I came across some very cool projects online and some that were using IoT technology to control and monitor their garden. I was amazed at all that could be done with IoT technology and ever since then I have been learning as much as possible about IoT and now IIoT.

@zackscriven Makes perfect sense to me -- but it does not make sense to the lay person -- which are our target audience for free content.  We use transport and protocol inter-changeably in our content because there is no point in distracting the lay person from the message that devices with intelligence should publish their data using report by exception, edge driven and open technologies.  MQTT is sometimes transport (OPC-UA pub/sub) and sometimes standardized protocol (Sparkplug B).  The fact that MQTT can be transported over serial or ethernet/ip or other is irrelevant (unless we are having a technical discussion about architecting a particular technology stack for a specific solution).","",""

Then we discuss iiot and then iiot edge device and then the device being iiot ready for the purpose of digitisation of their things so we can interact digitally.

I have discovered that I have to educated the audience and at first I was struggling to find that single starting point of common ground where they audience can be brought along.

@zackscriven Absolutely.  The video was short, concise and gave concrete examples to differentiate between a 4.0 product and a non-4.0 product.  Transport is the mechanism of sending information; ethernet, serial, etc.  Protocol is the method of encapsulating that information.  John Renaldi, Real Time Automation, described transport using an example of Sneakernet between two PLCs.  You go to PLC no.1, write down the information.  Walk over to PLC no.2, key in that information, receive and write down the response.  Walk back to PLC no.1 and repeat the cycle.  A simple, yet subtle example of transporting information between sites.","",""

Can you please explain a bit more on these two questions since they were touched a bit fast in the video:
1- how to connect old devices to iot, devices which are not web-services / mqtt capable? Do you have a concrete example from practice?

2- On application side: if I would elaborate my architecture with additional tools or devices, these tools are not known to the rest landscape, normally we would build an interface where it is needed, with iot we could connect them to the mqtt broker, however how does the broker knows the new data from the news system, So I believe I would have to elaborate the broker and all systems which need that data and need to subscribe these topics, correct? Is that not also quite an effort? Why is that an advantage compared to e.g. Restapi? Dont we have more advantages with an interface which can do more than a message broker?
Last but not least üôÇ we are always talking about metadata, how about data sets which are needed in many enterprise applications e.g. a documents or a drawing etc. the datasets cannot be sent via the message broker or am I wrong?

Using OPC-UA Methods requires a client-server connection so the transaction cannot be passed through the message broker.

In the case that a number of consumers need confirmed data from a single producer, using the message broker approach, each consumer must publish its own 'message received' topic that the producer must be configured to respond to. Using OPC METHODS each consumer asks the same question & gets its answer in a controlled way. Higher communication bandwidth required.

While these platform products are cool, I really wonder about the commercial viability.  You're right.  The licensing appears cost prohibitive.  I can't see someone adopting these platforms to build out their own solution upon and monetize.  It's crazy how the economics between IoT PaaS and ""vanilla"" PaaS / IaaS play out.  It reminds me of what often happens to those that build out products on the SalesForce platform.  At first, it's very enabling.

They find more freedom and achieve superior economics by taking slightly more ownership further down the stack.

@Mario Ishikawa This is dirt cheap compared what an CompactLogix or S7, fully featured (e.g., safety, motion, HMI), would run.  

I could see this groov product being potentially useful for enabling legacy assets without any field comms.

So as vendors it's our job to figure out how to make it easier to get the UN up into these platforms. It's still an open question to me on how customers will want to manage models (i.e. create them in Sitewise, and pull them down, or create them in tools like HB and Ignition, and pull them up).  In terms of use cases, what I'm seeing mostly is availability/OEE projects. Large manufacturers are looking at these tools as a way to build a turn-key solutions to get machine data up into their cloud platform, and visualized. Basically something a controls person can hook up in a day. They are assuming that if they can make this easy, and the data is their cloud in a modeled way, they can leverage it in other ways in the future.

@mdowdell 

I demoed Telit/ILS deviceWISE a few years ago.  It has a neat logic engine manage transactions (e.g., parse, trigger, sequence).  It has a ton of connectivity options into IT systems.  We decided against it because, at the time, it did not have all the drivers we needed.  Additionally, at the time, we only were interested in OPC connectivity.  We went with Kepware.  Kepware had more drivers with more features and appeared to be more proactive keeping up with device/protocol changes.

DW has worked well for automotive OEMs and large tier ones with homegrown MES/SCADA apps.  These apps, as one might imagine, tend to have more bespoke integration.  It might involve writing to SQL tables or dropping in driver libraries directly into the project.  AAM and Honda have had successful implementations.  It helped eliminate custom middleware and streamline integration projects.  AAM solved a lot of brownfield problems.  They deployed these Advantech remote IO gateways with WiFi.

Had I known how big of a challenge making field data useful was, I might have spent more time evaluating and considering DW.  But, there is something that did not sit well with me about the product's philosophy and how I saw it being adopted.","",""

They portrayed alternative solutions as leveraging OPC classic (i.e., OPC-DA) off the device instead of a native protocol.  I'm not really aware of anyone that leverages DCOM-based tech as their go-to solution these days.  There are well-known ways around this.  This may have been a misunderstanding.  Beyond the technicalities, it bothered me that Telit and their customers did not seem concerned with standards.  Yes, they transport data in standard ways, but they're not organizing the data itself in standard ways.  There was not much of an emphasis on information modeling.

The DW use cases seemed centered around taking a native device protocol, bypassing OPC (or any other similar standard), and inserting data into an app or database.  This is not particularly transformative.  Essentially, it‚Äôs a more efficient way to build the same one-off, discrete connections that have been in place for years.  OPC, despite its faults frequently discussed here, is at least a standard way to exchange information.  While often a simple name/value pair model in practice, it‚Äôs at least a standard.  There is value to normalizing data in a standard, repeatable way.

For those of that build and manage apps, they know their job does not end at protocol conversion.  They have to put considerable resources into modeling and contextualizing the data.  And, if a new app is introduced, another set of discrete connections must be mapped out and built.  If this can be done faster, that‚Äôs great.  But, it‚Äôs truly a missed opportunity not to question the need for these connections in the first place.  Or, taking a step back further, to question the apps used and how well they serve their purpose.","",""

@Paul Wright I was thinking about the parallels of what we encounter in the IoT world to EDI as well.  Will these mapping problems ever go away?

You're absolutely right.  Everyone has clung onto their legacy flat text formats (e.g., X12, EDIFACT).  And sadly, managing EDI is still resource intensive and prone to delays.  Everyone has their own ""standard"" of the standards.  None of it self-describing and requires a human to interpret a spec's definition.

I will mention that where XML has began to work out is between apps, particularly multi-tenant cloud apps, and VANs.  Instead of building out translation maps for trading partners in the apps, this is increasingly done by the VANs.  The apps and VANs exchange data in canonical XML.  The investment pays off when there is enough to adopt it.  There is strength in numbers (e.g., multiple ERP vendors, multiple trading partners).  This is harder to adopt in a direct 1:1 trading relationship.","","üíØ (1)"

HB has the full model, but you can configure it to publish only fields that have changed or the full model over MQTT. Sparkplug (protocol over MQTT) as another example will publish the full model on birth, but then only sends fields that change. Happy to show you or discuss more if you have questions. It often depends on the consumer of the data. At times it's easier to get the full model, other times if you're paying per bit of traffic then you only want changes.","",""

We're trying to evaluate if it is possible to reach the controllers' codes and get data, or modify programms to get data. The funny thing is we can absolutely reach the manufacturers of those machines, but their basic position is to vendor-lock us. Answering your question on how we wish to interconnect machines with other nodes, I would describe it as a brain-slug. We want to read discrete I/Os directly from PLCs' pins. Such way as we could do it programmatically. If the controller sets HIGH for a piston or a motor or does it receive some inputs from sensors, we read that directly from PLCs' pins, and register a performed action. The main kind of inputs is tools' activation, some external sensors (mostly optical), very few buttons. The main consumer of this information is OEE calculation tool, i.e. InfluxDB + Python through MQTT.","",""

It connects to their SINEMA remote management platform.  IBH Softec makes a hardware TeamViewer client that can be deployed in an electrical panel.  It's a gateway that securely encapsulates TCP/UDP-based protocols as a TeamViewer session.

In general, I'm not a big fan of industrial VPN appliances.  In practice, they're often misconfigured and not maintained.  At the same time, I recognize that sometimes they're the only practical option.  My biggest gripe with them is that they're not well lifecycled.  They also lack tools to centrally manage at scale.  Security is hardly a ""set-it-and-forget-it"" exercise.  If you've worked in networking, you'll know that infrastructure is continuously managed and patched to stay ahead of threats.  It's a formal discipline that has yet to become pervasive in the ICS space.  My preferred approach is to not reinvent the wheel, but to leverage one that works.

My favorite solution is to create a remote access console / jump box behind the firewall.  This is a dedicated, locked-down VM with software specifically to manage the asset(s).  VM is reached through a VPN session.  Console requires a valid directory account, adaptive MFA, and everything is logged.  VM and the asset(s) are each segmented with identity-based access policies via TrustSec.

This has a several benefits:  1)  Security is modeled around the intent.  2)  It's reliable.  Third parties don't have to fuss with their own remote endpoint or software.  3)  It's performant.  The asset's management protocol does not have to be tunneled across the internet.  4)  Change management and version control become part of remote access.

SD-WAN and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) are some newer technologies that have great potential for remote access.  Assets or sites can become nodes on an SD-WAN.  Access and security are orchestrated through SASE platform (security cloud) rather than an unmanaged firewall.","",""

I'm talking with a water company who are implementing an IIoT strategy similar to your 'why it will fail' scenario.  They are not so interested in downtime and OEE - more to do with Energy usage and environmental impact. So the big $$$ issue is environmental - they have deployed flow sensors in to sewers to make sure they don't flood the cities and rivers - pushing the data straight to the cloud, some kind of ML algorithm is trying to detect flood situations before they happen. They are also about to start pushing data straight to the cloud from water treatment sites. My guess is that this will make analysis very difficult to do. Lots of un-normalised data sources. My question is this.... Have you or any of the members here seen a unified namespace approach working with massive amounts of telemetry, and very geographically dispersed small SCADA/PLC sites.  They currently have OSI PI centrally with millions, probably 10s millions of tags. 10 years ago they used PI AF to normalise some of this data - this will most likely also be pushed into the Azure data lake eventually. But for now they are going straight back to the treatment site SCADA and PLCs for the data source.  Wow, what a dump of info - happy to clarify is none of this makes sense.

It's like an OPC companion specification.  It's a markup language for semantically modeling building automation.  It's the meta data for the ""tags"" coming off of things like HVAC, lighting, power, etc.  It seeks to unify the disparate protocols and data models in the building automation space.  It's goal is interoperability to take the friction out of IoT and SCADA/BAS (e.g., Tridium Niagara) integration projects.

My understanding is that Haystack is purely semantic and independent of transport.  Thus, it can coexist with and leverage MQTT or Sparkplug B.  It's theoretically possible to nest a representation of the Haystack information model into an MQTT or SpB payload.  This would be somewhat analogous to organizing a UNS around ISA95 structure.  It's just another way to organizing the information.  It could be used as a whole strategy or limited to edge use cases.

As I have limited exposure to this space, I cannot attest to the market adoption of Haystack.  On one hand, I could see it struggle for similar reasons as OPC-UA information modeling has.  On the other hand, building automation is much more simple than automating a manufacturing process.  The integration problem space for manufacturing assets (e.g., CNC, robotics, assembly, packaging) is on a whole different scale than building assets (e.g., compressors, air handlers, lighting).  As a result, Haystack might be more practical to implement.

I would imagine this would be ideal for distributed scenarios where it's beneficial to carry power in addition to data.  This could be an economical alternative to all the infrastructure required to deploy a local IO-Link Master or remote IO (e.g., AC, power supply, breakers, field switches, panels).

I've heard the process industry and utilities are clinging onto PROFIBUS for similar reasons.  They like the ability to carry power over the bus.  PROFINET, while capable of going long distances over fiber, lacks power.  PROFINET, over copper, with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) never took off as a suitable replacement.  It apparently could not meet the more stringent safety requirements found in the process industry.

For discrete manufacturers with more ""dense"" fields, SPE/APL is probably not a game changer.  Cable runs are either not a problem or they need to terminate in a nearby panel for safety.  In these environments, the benefits are probably limited to facility and auxiliary assets with limited controls.

It is interesting to think about how this tech could enable the deployment of smart sensors.  One of the most common brownfield issues is deploying sensors on inflexible assets (e.g., no panel space, limited power, no analog inputs, no fieldbus, locked logic, no documentation).  Machine builders, foolishly, love to gut their products of anything useful to integrate with a factory.

The bps of an analog, on/off sensor (ex. switch) is very low, maybe 100 bps but the time for that signal to reach the PLC program is very very fast, maybe a few micro-seconds.

In the case of most sensors or devices, there just isn't that much data so bps is not all that important once a certain threshold has been met. What is important is:
- how quickly you can act on that data (ie how much processing before the PLC program can read it)
- how reliable is that data
- how expensive is the required silicone in order to be able transmit and receive that data

The last one is where slower, simpler technologies can really win. The number of transistors required to handle an ethernet package vs an I2C (as an example, but could replace with serial) is 10x or more. This is a limiting factor in how cheap we can sensors and devices. I tend to think, if we could make sensors and devices really cheap (but still good) we could afford to put a lot more of them onto every machine, thereby increasing our depth of understanding of the process at any given time.

When the data comes in, two structures are created under the MQTTengine tag provider: 1) a nested directory hierarchy (expected) and 2) a directory where the groupID had the ""\\"" replaced with underscores (unexpected)

Every now and then the screen would get garbled. Even when new data was sent, some changes would be seen but still garbled.
I assume that fault lay in part on ""stupid"" LCD controller and protocol used (no checksum for example) but that mainly occurs due to I2C sensitivity to EM noise.
So I had to add a LCD output buffer in my program, reset the LCD every few seconds and send the buffered data again to LCD.

I2C has no checks built in, this is part of why it's so low cost and light weight. The memory buffer on the LCD screen likely got messed up by a bad block of I2C data. To keep data transfer low, the controller is only going to update the part of the memory buffer where changes are happening.

You're software solution of just refreshing the whole screen every once in a while is a good approach. A more electronics based approach like some of the chips suggested in the article above might be more reliable though.","",""

To be honest, I was in OPC-UA land at those times and the technology was fresh on the brain, and some of the claims I was hearing in the videos didn't jive with my understanding.  So, I put the questions out there in case I was missing something about how OPC-UA works.

I think the pinnacle of this is when @Walker Reynolds thought I was a member of the IIC or sold a RAMI product. I about fell out of my chair when I heard that.  Maybe a backhanded compliment of trying to go too deep on the subject?  üòÜ 

Also at the time, I only had a cursory understanding of MQTT and I had heard of SparkplugB.  The weight of marketing for OPC-UA is real and that's why I was more familiar with it.

Then I tried SparkplugB and watched the self-discovery process unfold before my eyes... That is IIoT.

So, my journey has been less of needing convincing that OPC-UA isn't appropriate at the Enterprise, but more of learning about SparkplugB, and realizing that these architectural evolutions are a repeat of history (how the internet became what it is today), then being surprised that the marketing term ""IIoT"" actual describes quite well what industry now needs.","","ismile (4),üëç (3),ü§£ (1)"

Although, I haven't worked with or used OPC-UA or an MQTT/SparkplugB, I have been reading a lot about them off-late and also learning a lot from @Walker Reynolds videos. What I understand is that MQTT is popular, proven and well supported in enterprise and consumer applications. It makes organization-spanning data exchange possible by decoupling data producers and consumers using a brokered pub-sub architecture and by defining a lightweight, data agnostic communication format that supports millions of connections. Sparkplug B defines an MQTT implementation standard that ensures client interoperability and enhances MQTT with features designed to support the demands of mission critical industrial systems. And finally, the edge devices provide the complementary reliability in the physical layer to process and transmission the field data securely and efficiently. Therefore, the combination of MQTT, Sparkplug B and edge devices forma a complete solution for the IT/OT data networks.","","üî• (3)"

I have a small question here. I just watched the video OPC-UA vs MQTT 2021 Update (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQLAmHza0Dc) and there it's stated that OPC-UA ""makes sense on the edge"". I'm not that experienced in this field and I'm struggling a little to understand what that means, especially when being integrated with other system like Sparkplug. Does that mean, that there should be an ""entity"" polling this Edge-OPC-UA-Server continuously and then bridging this information to e.g. Sparkplug?

If you look carefully in the traffic on Wireshark, you will notice a publish Request from the client to the server. This publish Request is sent at the rate that the client wants data sent to it. Even if there is no change in data (the client can't know if any data had changed, that's why it's asking, lol), the client still asks for the data. 

Imagine a boolean that changes once a year. The client wants to know that change within 1s of the change. The client will set its publish rate to 1000ms and it will ask the server if data has changed in that second. Then at that time a year when the boolean flips, the server will finally respond with the new data. Then the polling continues for the next year.

All the polling traffic from the client that occurs during that year doesn't exist with MQTT, because the client with the new data will publish only when there is a change, and then the clients that are subscribed will get it.

*Disclaimer: I'm ignoring keep-alive packets in this example.  MQTT has a small keepalive packet and OPC-UA uses the publish Request as the keep alive, although I've recently discovered that SDKs also use a ReadRequest of the ServerStatus node (ns=0;i=2256) to make sure the server is still alive, which is additional traffic.","","üíØ (3)"

By default, however, the queue size is 1, so while the server is queueing the samples at 100ms, when it comes time to publish the results, the client will only get the latest sample.

I didn't realize Ignition had an OPC-UA server.  I've only used Igniton's OPC-UA client with Kepware's drivers.  It never occurred to me that Ignition's native drivers, along with all other tag providers, all fed into an OPC-UA Server that could be exposed outside of Ignition.  This, paired with a local instance of KepServerEx with the OPC-DA client app should work.  It's like using Igniton and KepServerEx as one would typically, but just in reverse.

Another interesting discovery was the simulator tags within KepServerEx.  Normally, these are used as ""dummy"" tags to test the server and feed data into a client.  These tags are actually free to be written to like any other OPC tag.  The DA client app was able to write to them as if they were tags tied to a PLC.  From there, the UA server (through a client) or IoT Gateway (MQTT) could deliver the data into the IIoT infrastructure.

It was somewhat comical discussing enhancing native connectivity with the producer of app.  In inquiring about alternatives to OPC-DA (e.g., OPC-UA, MQTT, SpB, REST), they said... yes in  theyear 2021,  ""As companies start to become more interested in IOT, a decision will be made regarding how best to support those needs. It is unclear right now whether priority will be given to OPC-UA or MQTT.""  This tells me their market is ripe for disruption.","",""

Since KepwareEx has an OPC Classic Server, and you can create a memory tag there (you were using the simulator tags, which are the same concept), couldn't you just use the OPC-UA Server interface of Kepware? How will you use ignition here? Go from UA to MQTT?

Native to the platform they all do what the Kepware server does, which is connect to devices and shares those tags as a server (there are settings in Ignition to do this). That said, most commercial applications continue to use Kepware as the connection to plant floor data.

There are several tools that are used to map OPC-UA tags to other protocols like OPC-DA, MQTT, etc. I have used the Cogent DataHub for this.  OAS also does this, but I have found the former to be a more straight forward tool. I found OAS to be pricey. It also doesn't support SpB. Simulation tags make it easy to test connections and functionality. I discovered a bug in DH through this process which was fixed prior to commercial release.

If there is not OPC-UA server available, the memory tag concept would enable the client app to write to a local DA Server and then expose as a UA Server to UA clients (DA Client <> DA Server <> Memory Tags <> UA Server <> UA Client).

Given that Ignition has an OPC-UA Server, the client app can write to Ignition's UA server via a local OPC-UA client.  (DA Client <> DA Server <> UA Client <> UA Server).  This is probably the best way.

As far as where it eventually goes, it will go into a QMS/SPC app via HTTP POST.  There are potentially new consumers of this information.  Getting it into MQTT for distribution to othe rnodes via a UNS is likely in the works.  I'm happy enough to get out of the custom middleware business, reduce disparate connections, and start to converge data.

I looked into HighByte, but they only had a UA Client connector.  Additionally, in some deployments, the resulting API transaction to the QMS/SPC require further context defined by the user (e.g., send in data along with chosen attributes).

Further up the stack, in practice, it seems like most useful apps expose themselves via web services (e.g., SOAP, HTTP).  Generally, the need to get OPC-UA data out of the IIoT platform was to get it back to edge devices.  This could be accomplished by having the IIoT platform write data over the UA client interface.

The PublishRequest is the non-RBE behavior, here. In MQTT, you set the subscription up front, and then the client never has to request a publish again. So the PublishRequest is wasted traffic seen every time the value changes.

Given I have a cluster of three brokers, and I want to forward that Namespace to a higher-level broker in the Enterprise, and the cluster must go through a network gateway performing port address translation (read: typical function of a home router for internet access)

what is the best way to connect the two?

(1) a single node of the cluster at the lower-level initiates a bridge connection to the higher level broker. If this node in the cluster fails, then the bridge has to be created on a different node of the cluster,

(2) Higher-level broker initiates a connection to one of the nodes of the lower-level cluster through a network gateway via port forwarding. If this lower level node fails, the higher level broker can fail over to one of the other nodes (I don't even know if ""shared connections"" for subscription bridges exists in any brokers on the market)

(3) include the higher level node as a member of the cluster. Presumably, if a node at the lower level fails, the other two nodes will keep the higher-level bring up to date. Q: can clustered connections be routed through a gateway performing PAT, or do they need to be in the same subnet?

Once the cluster is formed, editing the bridge properties on one transfers to the other nodes of the cluster. I didn't know that's how it works: configuring one configures them all. So each node spins up clients to connect to the upstream broker. So far so good.

I tested publishing to each node, and verified that no matter where the data is published, it appears on the other node AND gets to the upstream broker through the bridge. Also, taking down the original node that was configured for the bridge still allowed the data to go through the bridge, proving that one configuration is shared/replicated between all nodes.

Something odd I can't explain: regardless of if the mqtt-bridge plugin was in a stopped or started state, the bridge functioned either way. I configured the bridge using the rules interface of the GUI: select statement to filters what data to bridge, then create a ""resource"" that was the client connection to the upstream broker.

Also, if both nodes in the cluster are connected to the upstream broker, are they are both sending data to the upstream broker creating duplicate publishes? The upstream broker seems to send out only one message per publish to my desktop client when it is subscribed, so maybe there isn't duplicated data? Maybe the cluster nodes can differentiate its incoming data: publishes from clients directly connected to them are sent through the bridge, VS publishes received through cluster replication are not sent across the bridge?","",""

Did you shut down bridging in all nodes? Where brokers restarted? I find it strange the bridge would still be active if the service was not active.

The purpose of clustering is to ensure that two local nodes do not publish the same data to the enterprise node.

There are a ton of solutions to monitor and/or control infrastructure (e.g., Splunk, Ansible, Puppet, ServiceNow, SolarWinds, DNA Center).  They have out-of-box support for CLIs and APIs  of all sorts of devices.  It's basically plug-and-play.  Unlike the industrial space, the data models and namespaces of these devices are typically standardized.  They do not vary by deployment in a way that something like a PLC would.  (BTW, this is why non-industrial tech people struggle with industrial tech).

A UNS is probably a good place for basic diagnostic information (e.g., state, temp, cpu load) as it can impact operations.  Infrastructure is one component of asset performance management.  Whether it's a motor or fieldswitch, downtime is downtime.  Providing visibility into every link in the chain across the enterprise is worthwhile.  

A UNS likely won't become the backbone of a NOC or DevOps team though.  There is such a strong ecosystem of tools that provide visibility and control with relative ease.  It's probably not worth reinventing this wheel.  Exposing meta data and embedding reporting/visualizations is more likely.","","üëç (2)"

They all operate in a similar way, located in the lower levels of the stack and recognising common industrial protocols. For the most part, they are passive - they listen for an interpret traffic rather than polling devices. (Active monioring is an option however). 

There are subtle differences in the way you deploy them - in some cases you need collectors on the network, in the Cisco case CyberVision runs on the network device.

Chances are it will eventually be subsumed into a single platform (IOT Operations Dashboard) along with some of the other management tools like FND/GMM. In terms of ISE, as far as I know, the only link between them and IND is via PXGrid. PXGrid allows ISE to ingest data from IND or CyberVision to provide contextual data about connected devices to help with enhanced segmentation. PXGrid is ‚Äòopen‚Äô and a number of vendors have built that ISE integration. 
Stealthwatch is different because it relies on Netflow data from the switches in the network. Not all the Industrial Products generate full Netflow so, in some cases, Stealthwatch is blind to what is happening in the OT layers. On the other hand CyberVision will provide similar data to Stealthwatch in terms of traffic flows and volumes but can also do DPI etc. I am not sure, but I can check, whether you can push data from CyberVision into Stealthwatch (or if it would add any value)","","üëç (1)"

What they do not seem to understand is that you don't need a bunch of technicians walking around with instruments taking vibration samples and then analyzing them. What you do need is a bunch of wireless monitors getting vibration samples 24/7 with analysts developing code to look for patterns. The latter is of much greater interest.

In my opinion, hard real time cannot be defined by a transmission frequency, but by the requirements of the respective process for the information runtimes. It makes a difference whether I fold 1000 tea bags per minute or assemble 4 units per minute. I see ""hard"" real-time in connection with control applications, e.g. servo drives. And for this, I would prefer a proprietary bus protocol that guarantees real-time at OT level instead of IT network-based communication. I remember the separation of these worlds being addressed once in a podcast.

I have the feeling that real-time is also often used as a buzzword without mentioning a connection to a concrete application for which the advertised communication technology then also offers real-time.

This contrasts with the fieldbus technologies developed by non-profit associations with for-profit ""puppet strings"" pulled by the industrial automation companies.  The largest market for TSN are the broadcast, telecom, and IT industries.  The standard has potentially wide adoption and, hence, good economics.  There is a good chance we will see Ethernet chipsets supporting these 802.1Q/P extensions in the coming years.  The automation industry is ""piggybacking"" on this work.

Personally, I don't believe it's helpful to distinguish between ‚ÄúOT and ‚ÄúIT‚Äù networking technologies.  Networking technologies are networking technologies.  Whether it is high-speed motion control, an international tv broadcast, a storage area network, or a telecom network; everyone wants performant networks.  The difference is that each desire low latency and low jitter for different applications.  The more this technology can be commoditized, the more effective it can be adopted and utilized.  TSN can exist in the field, exist in the enterprise, and it can traverse both.

TSN seeks to be deterministic in the same way that a fieldbus would.  The difference is that TSN seeks to do it without cutting down and/or modifying what is typically seen further up the OSI model.  Most Ethernet fieldbus technologies achieve their performance by being layer 2 oriented and ""dumb"".  They have extremely simple object models.  There is very little meta data.  There are header parameters (e.g., EDS files, GSD files) for the transaction, but there is very little to define or interpret the payload.  There is no discoverability.  It requires knowledge of what is being transmitted and how.","","üôå (2),üëã (1),üí° (1)"

It could allow for heavier, but more contextual payloads as well as interoperability with pervasive networking protocols.  This has benefits for not just field level communications, but also very high-speed data collection for IIoT.  The downside is that it requires special switch hardware to queue the traffic.  Given that it took industrial ethernet nearly 20 years to eclipse serial fieldbus adoption, it is safe to say that any TSN adoption will take some time.

Right now, most of the industrial applications are limited to testbeds at places like the Fraunhover-Insitut or RWTH Aachen.  Like a lot of great research coming out of these institutions, there is not a guarantee that the technology will be successfully adopted by the market.  This, unfortunately, lands squarely on the industrial automation companies.  The OPC Foundation has working groups on TSN and the Field Level Communication (FLC) initiative.  FLC seeks to harmonize all the field protocols into an OPC-UA information model over deterministic transport via TSN.

It would be amazing if there were just one flavor of industrial ethernet.  Protocol gateways can be such a hassle.  FLC is an incredibly lofty endeavor.  I‚Äôm not sure OPC Foundation is the best steward for this kind of thing.  Their membership is disproportionately influenced by the same organizations that were complicit in creating the scattered landscape of fieldbus protocols that we know today.  I‚Äôm skeptical that still-active belligerents of the 30+ year fieldbus wars are ready to cooperate.  They likely will draft a spec, but they won‚Äôt shape product management strategy around it.  There are too many that do not stand to gain from interoperability ‚Äì especially at the field level.","",""

Think like MQTT with Arlen Nipper (Eurotech) and Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) backed by Phillips 66.  It probably was not a coincidence that no one involved in conceiving MQTT was on the payroll of a PLC or SCADA company.  It can be very hard for something to be successful when there are conflicts of interest.

The more practical industrial applications of TSN are within, rather than across, industrial ethernet standards.   For example, ODVA and PI have been working on their own implementations of TSN for EtherNet/IP and PROFINET, respectively.  In the case of PROFINET, TSN could drive down the cost of or even eliminate their ASICs.  It might afford them to enhance the object model beyond what was conceived in the PROFIBUS days.  For EtherNet/IP, TSN could replace or enhance its current determinism functionality (i.e., CIP Sync via PTP).  This could mean improved interoperability with robotics, encoders, or vision.  Additionally, it could alleviate the performance degradation of using transport security (i.e., CIP Security via TLS).  On the other hand, I‚Äôm somewhat skeptical as there are a lot of features in CIP today that many vendors choose not to adopt.

If TSN achieves wide adoption outside the automation world and becomes standard in Ethernet chips, the economics will be hard to ignore.  If it can commoditize determinism, the automation world stands to benefit.","","üíØ (1),üëè (4)"

Do you really believe that the trend is moving away from specifically tailored fieldbus technologies to general multifunctional IT network technology? If this would succeed in providing the same performance as fieldbuses on the application-oriented communication layers, then new possibilities would open up as you described. However, the devices would then also have to provide more performance, wouldn't they? The ""stupidity"" of the field buses has guaranteed a fast connection even with limited computing resources, or has it?

The topic is also particularly interesting with regard to commercialisation. Perhaps the former developers of proprietary fieldbuses are trying to regain their status quo via TSN technology and counteract the trend towards open architectures? Can we already see this trend already?","",""

""Well, this is how we always moved I/O in [serial fieldbus predecessor].  Let's stick with this for Ethernet."" and ""This will never work with TCP/IP or UDP/IP.""

At least at the physical layer, we've already seen the industry move off of tailored fieldbus technology.  Serial will live on, but it's not poised for expansion.  It's taken time, but I believe it's safe to say that the market has adopted Ethernet.  Unfortunately, as the internet was becoming pervasive, there wasn't a clear answer on how to handle determinism with the standard stack.  With TSN, it appears, now there is.

You're probably right.  They're trying to stay relevant.  They want a seat at the table, but they don't want to cannibalize their walled garden and their legacy install base... at least not too quickly.  Some, such as B&R, appear to be embracing OPC-UA + TSN more than others.  But B&R has not been successful with their own fieldbus, Ethernet Powerlink.  ODVA views TSN as a way to enhance EtherNet/IP's determinism.   Similarly, PI views it as a way to enhance PROFINET's determinism and compatibility while also relying on OPC-UA TSN to move data ""up"" from the field.  We'll see what happens.

If we can see Rockwell or Siemens embed support for OPC-UA and TSN into their drives without any compromises, we'll know the verdict.

TSN is seriously powerful even with a heavier protocol like OPC-UA:

A lot of this worked is substituted or complemented with B2B commerce messaging protocols like EDI and cXML.  These automate the exchange of everything from purchase orders to scheduling to remitting payments.  These can also be utilized to exchange traceability or certificate of analysis data.  This technology has been around for decades.  It's somewhat primitive and the standards are not robust.  But, it works and is widely supported.

The aerospace industry has lagged behind other industries in B2B messaging adoption.  Much of this is driven by the lower volumes and diversity of customers.  It makes the payoff, especially for conservative suppliers, of automating the transactions less-obvious.  Another factor is low ERP adoption.  It takes serious investment to close the last-mile of functionality for aerospace.  They lack the expertise to integrate the necessary processes.

In an IIoT context, everything in the business is plugged into the architecture.  All of the data silos are unified and accessible.  By extension, an OEM customer can be a node in this ecosystem.  The right information can be intelligently exchanged over any protocol whether standard B2B messaging or an API.

It's probably worthwhile to examine how this supplier currently exchanges information with its customers.  Wherever the employees are pulling data from, they should be connected to the UNS.  This collective architecture (e.g., UNS, database, ERP) could be exposed to the customer with B2B messaging software.  This software can be standalone or a module within a full-featured ERP.","",""

(2) their docker container only works when in contact with the company's license server
(3) the license server is a VM running CentOS.

So the use case for sending out an edge gateway to an equipment manufacturer to be setup with an information model will not work with KepwareEdge in Docker.

I tried node red a little, but the EIP interfaces seem too rigid, where I worked need to specify the tags individually. It's too much work for what is supposed to be an industry 4.0 tech stack.

Finding a driver with BOTH tag browsing and linux support is tough.  The industrial world loves Windows.  Must it be OPC-UA?  Would a .NET Core driver work?  Have you looked into the pycomm library?

If you need to scale the application, it might be worth investing in an SDK or have someone build out the server.  This might allow to hit performance objectives too.  Try Real Time Automation (RTA), Ingear, or Softing.  RTA is a very good resource for this kind of stuff.  They really know E/IP well.  Ask for Drew or Scott.

The issues I've had with OAS is ease of use (not!), user interface and documentation are confusing\vague (intentionally), and the stingy licensing strategy (i.e. expensive).  Things I like is their support and technical staff are great.  I requested an output to InfluxDB for their logger module.  They worked with me to develop some baseline requirements and had a working prototype in a week for me to try out.  
They used the free C# InfluxDB Client from Vibrant (source on GitHub) and added it to their license model (not cool!).  Which triggered me to look into the other dependencies they use and ~90% are open\free dependencies and then they just wrap their GUI around them.  So I am following suit...  .NET has all the protocols use as free NuGet packages you can download and add as a dependency to create your own server.  I am currently using MQTT (MQTTnet), Modbus RTU/TCP (easyModbusTCP), OPC (OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua), and BACnet (BACnet protocol library for .NET).","",""

The multi-protocol support and bridging of distributed brokers were features that caught our attention.  So while acting as a 3.1.1 compliant MQTT broker, it can also use other messaging protocols (JMS AMQP etc), including allowing publish via http, and delivery of subscriptions into rest endpoints.  This opens up a lot of paths for us to adding legacy business systems as UNS nodes, where implementing a mqtt wrapper application isn't as practical.  There is also a microgateway option that will act as a web proxy so existing request/reply web service calls can be routed through the broker to generate events into the UNS.  So far it has seemed promising.  The bridging feature (they call it ""DMR"" or ""event mesh"") should allow for a single UNS to be distributed geographically, where local site nodes can continue to exchange data even if the other sites are disconnected.  It also gives us a single entry point into the UNS in the cloud rather than explicitly bridging to each facility.  I'd be very curious to hear if anyone else has any experience or feedback on it.","","uns (1),üëç (1)"

Last year I did an IIoT project with Apache NiFi. My NiFi flow consumes data from an MQTT broker, then does a little transformation stuff (uncompressing payload, decode protobuf payload, formatting the data to an SQL syntax) and finally puts the transformed data into a PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB table.
Recently I found out that Apache has another toolset called Streampipes that seams to have quite a few similarities to NiFi. It also seams that Streampipes is designed mainly for IIoT use cases as it supports quite a few industrial protocols (ethernet, field bus) out of the box. Now I am wondering wether Streampipes would have been a better choice for that project.

It is Coretigo - wireless IO Link that can work up 20m. This is different than the Balluff wireless which is just really a small-gap inductive coupler. With Coretigo you can get low-latency wireless connection and their Master has OPC UA and MQTT. Sweet!! Right??

We are currently specifying this equipment in some EAOT and a telemetry project. For the EAOT tooling well will be using a 24VDC inductive coupler (think Weidemuller) for electrical power transmission. The telemetry application for compressed air consumption (ProTip - great place to start for an inital DX project). I am including some SICK flowmeters (FTMG (have IO Link or OPC UA and MQTT) that we will be using. 

Anyways a  quick description of the the telemetry application... More than 150 semiautomatic assembly cells common in Tier 1 automotive that we will need to measure compressed air consumption. We will install SICK flowmeters connect them to Coretigo¬¥s Master via the Bridge than backhaul the MQTT with FreeWave ZumEdge. There are some more details, but I think you get the idea.

The EOAT tooling will actually use the low latency. Not really a big deal with the Telemetry. Also, the Coretigo range can be increased by using a different (""whip"") antennae and living with a higher latency. Maybe Coretigo is overkill for telemetry, but I love the idea of using IO Link sensors and being able to add other ""intelligent"" sensors for future applications.

One last thing.... price.... very competitive.

I have come across an issue regarding vanilla MQTT and Ignition MQTT engine module.  

Currently I have a TTN LoRaWAN server running on my local PC.  The TTN server publishes sensor data to an inbuilt MQTT server.  I used Node-Red to subscribe, parse and write sensor data to a modbus register in a PLC in order to get the data into Ignition.

I have tried using Igntion's MQTT engine to connect and subscribe to the TTN's in built MQTT server, however I couldn't see any sensor data.  Would I be correct if I assume this is due to the TTN server is publishing data in vanilla MQTT payload and Ignition Engine is looking for a SparkPlug B payload?

Ideally I would like to be able to use Ignition's MQTT engine to subscribe to the sensor data rather than my current configuration.

Has anyone got any suggesting?","",""

I have been working on a remote machine control project and it has me somwhat stumped as in how to proceed. In the past we have simply used the webvisu from codesys to control the machine from remote locations. However, wanting this system to be scalable, and have the ability to link individual machines together onto the same HMI display(a cellphone  or tablet) we needed a different solution.

One of the solutions I have been exploring is having the PLC publish tag data via MQTT to a topic in a Digital Ocean droplet that is running an instance of thingsboard on it. Thingsboard allows for great customer/device management and the ability to create individual dashboards for each customer. My problem with this solution is the dashboard doesn't seem to allow me to modify the widgets to what I need done. It also isn't extremely mobile friendly.

I am wondering if anyone has experience with this kind of thing and could recommend a better direction to take? For sending PLC data to the cloud, I think that MQTT is the way to go. However on the front end, I am looking for a solution that is immersive, and intuitive for the end customer. I have thought of going down the road of creating an app, but that then limits the amount of customizability I have moving forward. I'd be happy for any ideas that you may have.","",""

yes, MQTT supports TLS and certificate-based authentication - if you are interested in a deep dive check my YT video where I cover following topics:

* what is the Private CA (Certificate Authority) and why it is used in IoT deployments
* how to setup the Private CA and use it to sign certificates for IoT devices
* how to generate self-signed and CA-signed x509 certificates
* how to establish trust between IoT devices based on x509 certificates
* how to encrypt MQTT messages using TLS
* how to verify the identity of a device based on the certificate it is presenting

How good is sales teams of vendors keeping all this straight?

Maybe somebody here can help. So, here's the question: I'm having a little trouble with an OPCUA detail (oh, surprise). It is my understanding  that the certificate/private key pair used for the (a) secure channel and the one for (b) client authentication may be different, but I'm wondering if having two different pairs makes any sense in the real world. My scenario is some kind of bridge to OPCUA that can be ""easily"" configured by the user (which is not that easy much given the clusterfuck OPCUA is), and if possible, I'd reuse the client cert&pkey for both purposes in order to annoy the user a little less.

I will say that first impressions are that the architecture you outlined needs to be deployed by very skilled OT personnel. The number of abstracted layers sounds more like a system appropriate for a data center.

On the other hand, I'm reminded that Chick-fil-A uses similar architecture for their restaurants, where a skilled team manages remotely and the ""operators"" just need to know how to plug on power and connect a Networks cable.

I will also say that I don't like the idea of a single-point failure that s load balancer brings to a cluster of brokers.   By pushing the load balancing function to the client, the broker can be a true cluster. My goal is a masterless cluster where ANY of the nodes can go down and not affect function, they are all equal in function.

All that said, I still need to kick the tires of K8s and see what is possible. Microk8s sounds interesting. If it requires one node to be a single entry point, then I'm not interested.","",""

About the failover: the clients can keep a list of multiple subdomains provided by multiple Ingresses that lead to the same cluster (and you can update the list via MQTT). That way the clients also don‚Äôt need to know about your cluster topology. 

About only having to plug in power and network cables: this can be done if you have hardware that has a Lights Out Management (e.g. from Dell or HPE). Then you can remotely trigger the automated provisioning of an operating system and Kubernetes via LOM and PXE Boot basically as soon as someone plugged in the hardware. This can be done both for a normal on premise edge cluster or just a k3s on an edge device in some control cabinet. We built that kind of platform for customers already. That allows you to have identical deployment environments in the cloud, on premise and on the edge devices.","",""

OPC-UA server does advertise what companion specs it includes in its Namespace using the Namespace Array [ns=0; I=2255]. There is a high likelyhood that the companion spec  includes a custom structure that will not be understood unless the client also has the companion spec data model.

Sparkplug Templates are simply structures created from the base Sparkplug data types. The device implementing the Template advertises the structure with it's Birth Certificate.

This server exposes a massive set of data with several defined complex types (models). The types show up in 3rd party OPC Clients such as Matricon, under a separate types folder. However, Ignition, for instance, seems incapable of identifying the various instances of said data types as types, and there‚Äôs no apparent way of adding the OPC servers complex types to the Ignition UDTs. There‚Äôs no companion spec implemented according to the vendor. Each type has a namespace reference and the instances refer to the types if I check the properties. Is the problem on the Ignition side? The vendor was also nice enough to add descriptions to every single tag in the OPC UA server, and these are also not shown in Ignition. Is this a common issue, should I expect client applications to be able to make use of all this tag metadata and add server complex types into its own UDT/type/model set?","",""

That would be an interesting feature for Ignition to interpret each instance of a complex type as a UDT instance, with the definition of that UDT being contained by the dataType in the server's unique namespace.

Also, by sending the next Publish request only after processing the previously received Publish reponse, the client-side is always kept in sync with the server side.
I was guessing that considering that as community members here claim that MQTT Pub/Sub works well in their use cases, then sampling/reporting with the same rate for all consumers ( assuming that the fastest required) is just fine.
Other than overloading some consumer applications, I wonder, is it possible that the network is overloaded too with too many messages?

One of the most important things to note -- is that the vast majority of PLC tags do not change as frequently as once per minute.  That is, about 93% of all tags in a PLC namespace, change less than once per minute (on average, across all PLC applications).  Edge Driven & Report by Exception makes all of the difference.  When you are only pushing changes AND no-one is ever waiting for a response, you can move a massive number of tags.","","üíØ (3),üëç (1)"
"753688565807841492","ravil1","2021-09-18T00:28:32.8950000+08:00","I thought that often, if a measurement yields a floating number type result, then each measurement will give a value slightly different than the previous one. Like 20.123456 first time, and then 20.123457 next time, and so on. So if you sample the parameter every millisecond, then you will get data changes every miillisecond. 
Using deadband, you can filter out such small changes. In other terms, the deadband is like the desired precision of your measurement. 
When you measure integer type values, for example, if that is the counter of something, of course, the picture is different. Or boolean values, like if a door is open or not, that would not have noise fluctuations either. 
In OPC UA, each client can ask the server, what sampling rate and precision it needs to get data with. If your use case is such that for all data consumers, the same sampling rate and precision are OK, then this kind of possibility of a per-consumer flexible configuration loses its value.
Note that in OPC sampling rate is not the same as reporting rate. It is how often the server takes reading (in case with a sensor - how often performs measurement of the parameter). If the reading value is the same, or the difference does not exceed the deadband, it is not reported over and over again.","","üëç (2)"

That's changing fast.  There are some good reasons to leverage the cloud for this, but it's no longer as clear cut a line.

And in many industrial settings, whether you train cloud or edge, it's still often advantageous to train instance level or ""in-situ"" models rather than population models.  For example, you might have 100 of the same pump across 5 sites, and you're using a vibration sensor to get some insights on performance and reliability.  Each pump might be handling different materials, be mounted on a different foundation/surface, be surrounded by other sources of vibration or noise, and ultimately instance-level training might yield the best results versus the approach of aggregating the data from all 100 pumps and building a unified model.

How'd that work out?  Ask the SCADA and historian vendors how much engineering capacity still goes towards drivers.

MQTT was ""elegant in its simplicity"" at its beginning for the very specific problem of telemetry, but it clearly fell short in terms of interoperability (no formal payload practices, namespace practices, etc) and simply sucked as a mechanism for request/response (methods, services).  It also presumed the world was hierarchical, which it ain't.  So we bolted on Sparkplug, which was well intended in its mission, but missed the mark on a bunch of fronts.  I personally think it loses/hides some of the goodness of MQTT in the way topic names and subscriptions can be managed.  I also think it is too opaque and ""chunky"" in the way it defines the prebuilt topics and moves data and metadata, and not very ""queryable"".

As you stated, there are many ways to slice this.

In sparkplug, there always must be a node. Devices are optional.  If what you are describing is that a device is a separate piece of hardware, where it is reasonable that the connection is severed or it loses power separate from the node, then it certainly makes sense to send a DDEATH representing that loss.

The diagnostics you are talking about are not in the device (because it is disconnected) but are happening by the node itself. So my first thought is to continue sending the diagnostics in the node object.

So here is something else to consider, a node can have virtual devices. So it's possible, too, that you organize your address space by putting these diagnostics in a virtual device that has a similar name to the real device so that an application could subscribe to those two devices (real and virtual), then the application would see the DDEATH of the real device and continue to get the diagnostics info.

You can, of course, keep the diagnostics in the node metrics, but currently Sparkplug would require an application to get ALL metrics in the node, even if they only care about those device diagnostics. The only lever to pull on segmentation is to create virtual devices.","",""

You can have an IIoT platform (e.g., Ignition) handle the different encodings by parsing and synchronizing value across the topic namespace.  This provides flexibility to work with vanilla and sparkplug b clients in the same ecosystem.  The clients would publish into different parts of the namespace depending on what they support.

You could also potentially leverage a gateway to enable Sparkplug B (""SpB"") support.  This could work out as some onboard IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT, OPC-UA) interfaces are clunky and require explicit programming on which tags/registers to publish.  The gateway would hit the native protocol and then publish SpB.  Going from standard MQTT to SpB is an interesting gateway use case.  Maple Systems cMT-SVR might do this.  HighByte is an option.  It has connectors for both.  If you need a local HMI, Ignition Edge would work too.

Traditionally we need to store multiple tables with multiple keys to represent the different relationships (be they hierarchical, proximal, etc.) 

In a knowledge graph, each entity exists as a node in the graph and the relationship exists as an edge between them. Sometimes multiple edges between the same nodes representing different relationships. It provides for a much more dynamic representation of the organization for MES/MOM (S-95) purposes while allowing for other modeled relationships outside of that definition.

As @Kirt Anderson says, a graph model is superior in that it an easily model pure hierarchies, but it can also model more complex relationships.  Most graph models also allow metadata/properties and ""typed"" relationships between nodes.  It becomes an incredibly powerful way to model manufacturing ""stuff"" - both the physical entities and the information assets/artifacts that we use in our applications.

I would also like to see the concept of flexible metadata on a topic as a first class capability of MQTT and/or Sparkplug.  That capability can provide other queryable attributes for topics.

For instance, processing unit A would be a singular node within the facility, but processing unit A would also have module 1, 2, and 3 that would be a part of it, and each module would have its own widgets, etc.

You mention that having to draw a line across branches makes it a relationship, not a hierarchy, but this type of structure is pretty similar to what would be seen in a matrix organization.  I wonder if it would be possible to leverage this as a way to describe some of these new structures.

WW did it with System Platform but with tighter coupling to the SCADA layer. OSI did it with Asset Framework but with tight coupling to the historian. Both allowed you to create an S-95 structure but didn't enforce the ontology. Libre enforces the S-95 ontology but the graph allows for relationships that weren't really possible in a relationally based product. 

In both cases (WW/OSI - and for that matter, VantagePoint and every other SQL model), the performance sucked:
1. Because of the transposition of time series, 90 degrees off from the transactional layer.
2. Because a relational data structure doesn't make non-hierarchical models easy to create and makes the querying of the data for complex models a nightmare.

What Libre is attempting to do is to create a more configurable and dynamic structure for data modeling and a more computationally efficient and user friendly means of aggregation while providing single point querieable and subscribe-able data access.

In the last Q&As, Apache Kafka was often mentioned.

Also, the stream processing capabilities can be used to directly process, enrich and prepare data streams for a consuming application.

For example it does not support dynamic topics (topics need to be configured) which means that a new client can't just publish to a topic without configuring it first. Due to this a subscriber can‚Äôt just ‚Äûautomatically"" recieve data from new devices using wildcard subscriptions. Also Kafka does not support topic hierarchies which are essential for a unified namespace. 

Further, Kafka is missing some other important IoT features as keep alive / last will & testament / retained messages. A bit less important but still relevant is that Kafka client is relatively complex and resource intensive and the Kafka protocol is more heavyweight than MQTT. Depending on your cloud connection and the amount of data that you are dealing with, this can become a problem. If you have a lot of plants and you want to use Kafka on premise, it also comes with quite a bit of operational effort.

You can also find a good summary on why Kafka is not a good solution for IoT here:  https://www.hivemq.com/blog/streaming-iot-data-and-mqtt-messages-to-apache-kafka/

That being said: Kafka is a great extension to any IoT/IIoT platform and I would always use it on top of an MQTT broker for streaming use cases or generally just to store all messages for data analytics and continue from there, even if you just want to persist the messages in an object store.","","üëè (3)"

You don't need to create a site-to-site VPN, forget about network aspects like IP range overlapping, NAT, or something like that because the IOhub network transparently allows the IOhub applications to send information using the Data Exchanger container.

And the often overlooked item is the impact of data archival/deletions on performance (some DB's don't even permit deletion per se).

"794020366536146977","mparris","2021-10-31T02:10:23.8400000+08:00","Consider the following tech stack:
--Physical
--internet
--transport
--communication
--information
--application

For an integrator trying to deliver a product at the application level, how much of the tech stack is automated and how much must be developed?

Fortunately, today, physical-internet-transport (Ethernet-IP-TCP) is so common that these are assumed to be automated for the integrator... No development required.

In the communication layer (my definition),  an application protocol (per the traditional 7-layer OSI model) is considered coupled with an encoding method for a particular information layer. (Coupling application protocol and encoding together in one layer isn't important... It could be considered two different layers, but just trying to keep the tech stack model simple.

In the communication layer, there is a lot of combinations in the world, and it can't be assumed that a product supports one's favorite communication protocol. This layer automates the need to map to transport objects (individual bytes) and allow mapping of communication objects (registers, variables, etc) Examples at this layer are:
**MQTT--SparkplugB-ProtoBuf
**MQTT--UA-JSON
**TCP--UA-Binary
**HTTPS-MTConnect-XML
**Ethernet/IP
And so on

Then there is the information layer. Object definition lives here, which specifies various combinations of data objects found at the Communication layer to form a complete object. Rather than an application integrator having to manually map communication objects (registers/variables), he can map information objects, such as a machine, remoteIO, etc.  This is what the OPC companion specs are trying to do. Factory+ at University of Sheffield in the UK has some object definition examples sitting on top of sparkplug.

The use cases for universal object definition may be limited compared to all the applications that will exist, but the fact that we don't have this for anything is more telling of the state of the industry than anything else.","",""

TrustSec is a NAC architecture based on 802.1x among other technologies.  802.1x, in a nutshell, is authentication to switch ports.  Some devices support it and other do not.  With PLCnext being a notable exception, most industrial devices do not.  The way around this is bypassing authentication, segregating, and issuing policy on the device's network rather than the device itself.

To answer your question, yes, but with variation in implementation and levels of support.  The access policies can extend beyond layer 2.  It's more of a question of with what and where the policies are being enforced.  The switches, wireless controllers, and VPN clients typically do this.  Without knowing more about your edge device, I would assume it can't do enforcement directly.  You might be able to drop in VPN clients (acting as supplicants) on it to create enforcement points between the various NAT'd device networks.  Or, assuming the NAT'd device networks are advertised to the core, you could create access control policies for these externally.  Alternatively, it's probably more straightforward to connect everything to switches directly and simply enforce policy there.","",""

(1) When a product lists OPC-UA in its datasheet, in nearly all cases it is referring to Data Access (DA).  Generalizing ‚ÄúDA‚Äù as ‚ÄúOPC UA‚Äù has made it difficult for end-users and integrators to locate the minority of products that support OPC UA technologies beyond DA.

(2) In OPC webinars, the presentations have focused on the growing number of working groups, Cloud Library, information models to move data from the sensor to the cloud, and other new technologies. It is valuable to highlight the products that are a result of this work.

(3) Data Access is the lowest bar of entry into the OPC UA portfolio.  Including only Data Access within a product is not notable, especially since the technology has been released over 15 years.

In summary, the industry should recognize and encourage products implementing functions outside Data Access. Especially since the functions that are within scope of this catalog such as A&C, HDA, Agg, GDS, Pub/Sub, and Companions Specs have contributed over 4900 pages to the specification, whereas Data Access accounts for 52 pages.","","üíØ (2)"

1. Manual finishing machines (VFD or pneumatic). For the VFDs we used one digital input, one digital output, and one isolated analog input. The input ties into a signal to know if it is running or not. The output can be used to disable the drive until the production order is logged into Tulip (http://tulip.co), and the analog input is to know how fast the equipment is running since we have validated requirements for medical devices. Typically 0-10 or 2-10 volts. We used two EPICs for 41 pieces of equipment, cable trays, control cable, ethernet for the MS Surface GO interfaces, etc.
2. In some legacy rotary finishing machines. They have very old GE/Emerson controllers and it wasn't worth the cost to tie in or replace, so we went with a Rio in each of the 6 machines since it plugged in quite easily since there was extra DIN rail inside the control cabinet. We used PoE to power the Rios and are currently only using 2 I/O.

As I understand, in the UNS concept, using MQTT broker, when data is published in MQTT topics designed to reflect ISA-95 hierarchy, means that the data modeling is already implemented at the stage when that data is published. So, if a PLC supports MQTT, then your data modeling is already implemented at the PCL level. Is that right?
I wonder, how this modeling at the PLC level is done? How it is designed in the first place, and then how it is provisioned to the PLC, and then how changes are maintained? For example, how do you change the frequency of data being sampled, or how do you change the deadband?

I think also possible to implement modeling at some higher level. So the PLC would present data values in a flat way, like input1, input2, input3, etc, and outpu1, output2, etc. And then you compose a model at some middleware application, like HighByte - where you compose for example model for the Pump1, mapping variables from PLC to object fields, like PLC1/input 1 becomes Pump1/temperature, etc.

Which way is the most common?  Isn't the second more flexible, because my guess is that configuration at the PLC level is harder than the configuration in some middleware applications like HighByte?","","üßê (1)"

They have among the best CNC editing and DNC technology with integration into major CAM packages.  They're not strangers to integration, but their core product is focused on a very specific solution.  Perhaps their product could be enhanced to coexist and interoperate with an IIoT infrastructure.  Perhaps they could add MQTT or REST interfaces for remote orchestration.

Another company worth getting in touch with is System Insights / VIMANA.  They're one of the few IoT products with deep functionality and domain expertise in machine tools.  It's built on a modern AWS stack, it's MTConnect-based, they understand G-code, etc.

Again, one of the largest issues here is going to be the existing machine control architectures themselves.  NC programs typically get exchanged over a file transfer protocol (e.g., FTP, SMB) and everything else is on a separate communication protocol (e.g., FOCAS, MELSEC, S7, OPC-UA, MTConnect).  Outside of a DNC package with some secondary data collection, it's rare to find products that can interface with both.  It's even more rare that they'll support multiple machine builders, multiple protocols, etc.  Ideally, as @Russ from the Internet alluded to, this problem will disappear one day and we won't even think about DNC.

It sounds like there is some market for some sort of super gateway for CNCs.  While there is definitely a need to abstract away the native interfaces on the CNCs, it's not as simple as converting everything to MQTT or HTTP.  This is much more sophisticated than consuming tags.  These aren't just SCADA workflows (e.g., trending, visualization, alarming).  There will be client applications needed to handle CNC editing, visualization, version control, etc.","","üëç (2)"

An MQTT broker is technically a TCP server.  An MQTT client opens TCP connections to the broker to publish and subscribe to data.  Inside this connection, data can move both client-to-broker and broker-to-client.

If they're inquiring whether they can connect some sort of app/device with a generic TCP Server to an MQTT broker, they can indirectly.  Suppose a device exchanges ASCII telegrams over TCP.  A gateway could do this.  On one end, a TCP client would read/write ASCII to the device.  On the other end, an MQTT client would pub/sub to a broker.

**Can [an] MQTT [broker] [hosted in the cloud] connect to a TCP Server?**
Yes, but with a gateway.  An MQTT broker is also a server.  It needs an MQTT client to create connections.  Likewise, the other TCP Server in question needs a TCP Client to create connections.  The gateway would need two client interfaces:  one for MQTT connection and one for the TCP connection.

**""Does the client have to connect to [the] MQTT [broker] first?""**
Yes, but not first.  Always.  Only clients connect to brokers.  The messages inside the connection, however, can be exchanged in both directions.","","üëç (1)"

And as you point out,  a well architected cloud solution (I'm quite sure MachineMetrics fits this definition!) can be made very resilient to DC or Zone failures.

The issue I've seen is usually when the connection to the cloud is lost for any number of network related reasons (telco issues, weather, on-prem WAN gateway failure, etc) - then all the cloud redundancy in the world won't help.

One needs client/server to be able to browse and expose the various OPC-UA services.  This is similar to EtherNet/IP.  The Scanner will first establish an explicit connection (TCP) with the Adapter first and the I/O values are exchanged over an implicit connection (UDP).

This is one of the reasons why AMQP has been a preferred for transport in OPC-UA Pub/Sub.  While a pub/sub protocol, AMQP has native support for request/response messaging patterns.  Its originated out of the financial services industry to solve complex service bus problems.  It's not as lightweight and simple as MQTT, though.  It does not get used much for IoT devices and telemetry applications.

Check out this presentation from a few years ago at OPC Day Finland.  Presentation is about TSN, but many client/server + pub/sub questions came up.  Around 21:30.

So far, we've seen mostly UDP for M2M applications (e.g., Beckhoff, Siemens).  MQTT for embedded devices to cloud (e.g., B&R).  AMQP for SCADA and Cloud (e.g., Iconics).  Add in TSN, and there have been concepts involving all three transports for M2M.

What's concerning is the framework touts the flexibility of multiple transports, but automation OEMs are developing products without this flexibility.  They each appear to have a preferred transport.  The transport(s) the market adopts is going to be more a function of what products support than the transport technologies themselves.

He says that there is no need for Pub/Sub, except for TSN, because they already have subscriptions (data on change) through client/server.

This is likely the best embodiment of the blindspot that those in the Fountain had at the time. It's amazing how Sparkplug existed at the time and could be evaluated, but appears that no one involved in the specs did any market research to learn about it? How else does one explain that OPC UA Pub/Sub lacks standardization around it's payloads and topic paths?

If subscriptions were sufficient, we would have not witnessed people leverage all sorts of pub/sub technologies for the past twenty years.  One-to-many integrations and lightweight communications are important requirements.

You're absolutely right about those lacking experience with integration.  Look at that slide about cloud federation.  It's absurd.  We've poked fun at the vertical reference architecture that ""layer"" OPC servers before.  This one for cloud federation is insane.  It's multiple transports point-to-point in the same architecture.

I'm listening to the OPC Year-in-review, and they are discussing the Cloud LIbrary.  The concept as I understand it is if a product wants to know the information model of a device prior to connecting to it, it can hit a cloud endpoint to find out what information it has.

This seems at a high-level equivalent in approach to discovering devices by connecting to some parallel infrastructure such as a Global Discovery Server.

It seems they have started down the client/server road and are in too deep to pivot to have the devices themselves provide their Information Model for others to consume.  Also similar to lacking a means of discoverability that is built-in to the application infrastructure, rather than parallel systems (global discovery server).","",""

One rarely has the freedom of choice when it comes to protocol or transport on industrial nodes.  It's more of a function of a brand than anything else.  ""The market"" does not decide protocol, but the hardware that adopts protocol.  And the market for this hardware is constrained by locality, compliance, tradition, workforce, distribution agreements, etc.  In other words, industrial automation is purchased for countless reasons other than protocol.  Additionally, industrial nodes are rarely lifecycled for protocol enhancements.  For example, how many PLCs sold in the past ten years are going to soon have support for AMQP/TSN?  Virtually none.

For similar reasons, I find it bizarre when standards bodies adopt a particular technology (e.g., OPC-UA, EtherCAT).  For example, when China standardizes on EtherCAT, they're implicitly endorsing Beckhoff.  It's not like Rockwell and Siemens are going to interoperate over EtherCAT anytime soon.  Is that going to stop manufacturers from acquiring machinery that is not available with Beckhoff controls or EtherCAT?  Of course not.

As long as users don't have the choice, being transport independence is more a hindrance than a benefit.  Unless the standard has some sort of compatibility requirement, it's just another interoperability issue for consumers sort through.  Consumers don't want to deal with two products stamped with the same certification failing to interoperate.  This diminishes the value of the standard.  The point is that the engineering should not exceed what a bespoke integration would take.

It's continues to be a revealed on this discord server as a design principle at the very core of the specification.

I used to view this as a strength of the surgical. As one of the pillars discussed here is openness, what's better than an open framework that can enable developers to evaluate a given problem and be flexible to accommodate any number of ways of optimally solving that problem? Why restrict innovation by reducing the possibilities to a narrow feature set?

I then realized that this thinking was primarily from the perspective of developing a server.  The attraction of options for the server developer is the nightmare of the developer of the client. The client must accommodate all the possible variation that servers may present.

My thesis is that wide market adoption of a standard won't happen unless there is an obvious and compelling client application: something that provides value itself which then requires the standard to utilize.  For example,  a conversation may start: ""Why should I use OPC UA over Modbus?"" Then a response:  ""Because there is this awesome desktop application and if you use OPC UA, you'll get to utilize that application. If you use modbus, you won't. Ohh, and also there is this other awesome cloud service. If you use OPC UA, you get to utilize it. If you use modbus, you don't""","","üëç (2)"

Here are some suggestions that don't totally fit your requirements, but showcase some broad approaches.  Some of the edge devices appear like their intended for hobbyist / DIY applications than industrial environments.  Sure, there exist hardened devices but they don't seem to consistently fill the void in the market.  It appears that there is a trade off between what's optimal for control/connectivity/apps and what's optimal to connect field devices.  If you're struggling to find a ""unicorn' product, perhaps it's worth breaking up the requirements for multiple products to satisfy.

Opto22 or Beckhoff are good I/O options.  Their I/O modules can be paired with a full-blown PLC or they can function as a remote I/O.  You might find the Beckhoff's TwinCat runtime might be a nice home for your C/C++ applications.  TwinCat is an extremely flexible solution.  B&R is another dev-friendly platform to look into.

If low cost is an objective, take a look into Access IO products.  I've observed their solution to be surprisingly reliable.  As mentioned elsewhere, another option to explore is the industrialized RPi or Arduino solutions.

If your actuators will be drawing a lot of current or you can't find suitable I/O for your application, look into using relay contactors.  It can be far more economical, reliable, and flexible to decouple the control power and its outputs from the actuator loads.  It's added complexity, but it will allow you to ""adapt"" more products to your application.","","üëç (1)"

- open source documentation and collaboration like stack exchange
- a good IDE
- version control, including branching and diffing
- good library support. Real Controllers will have libraries for basics like E/IP, but lack a lot of business logic libraries and the ones I've found are poorly documented and confusing to use. It seems the Real Controller community isn't very into sharing
- Full suite OOP tools. Codesys with ST comes close to being able to implement full OOP but its still clunky and lacking

There is an Arduino extension for VSCode that is very good and allows you to use all the code highlighting and static analysis built in there. However, it doesn't solve the global libraries issue when you are handling multiple projects.

That's why the second rule of using Arduino is to use PlatformIO. Nearly every ""Arduino"" board, including most of the hardened, industrial Arduinos can be used within PlatformIO. PlatformIO has a proper library manager, similar to NPM for Javascript that has all the friendly Arduino libraries in it already. It also allows you to structure your files in multiple folders, has proper debugging support and a unit testing framework.

I think the confusion comes from the word Arduino meaning different things to different people. Some people think Arduino === Arduino Uno and dismiss it out of hand. Some people think Arduino == Arduino IDE and rightly have a poor taste for it. I think of Arduino as a microcontroller platform and HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Admittedly, it's not the best HAL or platform, mBed is arguably better. However, it is the easiest to use for newcomers, extremely widely adopted and loved by the open source community, which means there is tons of great learning content and open libraries for just about anything you would need.

There are holes or gaps, lack of printf for floats and little comms outside of serial (although ESP32, among others has an ethernet stack and MQTT Arduino libraries exist). You also can't ""download"" a program from an Arduino in the field like you can a PLC, something that trad industrial controls engineers have come to expect. I think there could be a nice marriage between an Arduino, for ease of controls programming and an Rpi, for the heavy comms, vision processing and edge AI/ML/Compute, all wrapped in a nice package with a single communication line and programming environment.","","üëçüèº (5)"

Chasing a lot of data upfront will be time consuming‚Äìmy suggestion is to stay agile. I worked on the ISO DT project w/ MTConnect and robotics to show how to get feedback. It really depends.

Most robot APIs can give you joint positions and end effector positions given a coordinate system. You can do the kinematics yourself to compute interference. Usually the robot vendors make the models available online using DH params. ABB has OPC-UA using two models (makes life confusing), FANUC uses EIP (ControlLogix), etc... ROS-2 has some interesting tools that layer on top of existing robots and provides a lot of functionality. ROS-2 supports DDS as the communications layer.","","üíØ (2)"

I've done a lot of projects with Fanuc robots.  In terms of making them ""IIoT ready"", there exists all sorts of communication interfaces that can be specified.  This is somewhat trivial.  The bigger problem is making sure the robot programs are built in a such a way that they're providing good data.  For example, it's good to go overboard with position registers and expose them for data collection.  This provides context of what the robot was doing when analyzing other data.

Fanuc robot tips:
-Define everything as a position register
-Be declarative about state/intent in each routine.  Historians and alarms can be useless without context.
-Map User Operator Panel (UOP) signals
-Identify SNPX variables of interest.  A lot of the data for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection can be found here.
-Enable HMI Device software option (GE-SRTP protocol) to read/write to registers directly.  This can be preferable to indirectly accessing internal registers through mapping to the I/O payload of a fieldbus (e.g., EtherNet/IP, PROFINET)
-For more advanced control or analytics, partner with vendors with experience in the KAREL programming environment.
-If also using Rockwell PLCs, look into leveraging the PLC Motion Interface AOI.
-Find a good gateway for the native protocol (SRTP).  I usually use the Kepware GE Ethernet drivers.

Kuka has an embedded Windows PC supervising its controllers.  These are among the most easy to get data out of and closely participate with the OPC-UA / I4.0 movement in Germany.  Some of the more modern ABB models have a lot of slick interface options.  They have everything from the OPC-UA to fieldbuses to web services and libraries.  They've seem to have upped their integration game since acquiring B&R.","",""

The native protocol on a Fanuc robot is technically SRTP/SNPX (and also potentially FL-net).  With the non-native protocols, typically everything must be mapped into the ""i/o racks"" for the fieldbus interface to ""pick up"".  It works well enough for field integration, but it's not as elegant for data collection.

In most implementations, I usually prefer AB Safety PLC supervising the robot and anything else in the field.  While the R30i- is a great controller, its ladder engine is very old school and the interface options are more bespoke.  There usually isn't much room for expansion in the enclosure.  It's better to do the visualizing, alarming, safety, and other device control on a more focused platform.  In parallel to this, data will be collected directly from the robot over the SRTP interface.  It seems to add friction to go always go through a PLC to data out of a robot (map to robot's i/o rack, exchange over fieldbus, map to PLC's robot tags, map to data collection UDT, exchange over native protocol, etc).

If you need a field gateway for SRTP, check out Maple Systems.  They have GE drivers.","",""

With a plant at a sufficient size, this is a job for network engineer.  A good network should be balanced.  It should be driven by intent and policy.  Typically, when things go wrong, it's attributed to one of two things.  The first is an improvised network with unmanaged switches everywhere.  This inevitably leads to performance, reliability, and security problems.  The second is a well-intentioned network that is too rigid and difficult to manage.  This is where no one knows what the traffic flows should be and all the one-off policies across disparate appliances becomes unwieldy.

I would start with the Cisco Converged Plantwide Ethernet reference architecture.  It's very Rockwell-centric and I wouldn't necessarily advise adopting it end-to-end.  It's also a bit dated in that LAN technology has evolved in recent years.   Namely, it's still using traditional topology (core/distribution/access) or it does not factor in software-defined networking.  But, the principles regarding segmentation and security are sound.  The DMZs at various levels can appear like the Purdue security model (which is often cause for concern), but notice that it prescribes using identity-based access control.  I like this because it's not just showing how to handle Ethernet at the upper levels, but also in the lower layers for fieldbus applications.

That's the real-world technical breakdown.

- AWS just joined the OPC Foundation last year....its going to be interesting to see where it goes.

So far, I assumed that with Pub/Sub you just send the OPC UA object hierarchy via MQTT but it turns out that the OPC UA foundation created something much worse. Turns out that with OPC UA Pub/Sub you are sending values in byte arrays without names or meta information wrapped in a lot of overhead via MQTT. And if the implementation provider didn‚Äôt implement any of the (of course optional) alternatives to communicate metadata, each subscriber needs to know what field sits where exactly in the ""byte sausage"" that is sent over the wire. This happens to be the case with the Siemens implementation. Which would be fine if there were any schemas that you could use to parse the binary data but there aren‚Äôt. Also, at least the Siemens implementation requires you to define an explicit publish interval, so no report by exception is possible. And because the spec is so badly written, all of this is probably fully OPC UA Pub/Sub compliant. Btw I‚Äôm not annoyed by the Siemens implementation but by the OPC UA spec itself.","",""

The pricing is much more competitive on this generation.  The 600kb models, even with motion and safety, are quite good value.  One used to spend 3x more to get these features in a base processor.  These offer so much more than the Micro/MicroLogix models for  not much more.  While they lack IIoT connectivity, these have excellent driver support.

While not necessarily a bad product, I feel like the Micro800 was created/acquired for small machine builders to satisfy customers that demand AB at lowest possible cost.  It provides customers with the name but not what they normally would associate with the name.  Unfortunately, they have so many shortcomings in terms of connectivity and software.  For example, it's basically pointless to offer a PLC with EtherNet/IP interface without Class 1 CIP support.  Outside of HMI/SCADA, most fieldbus connections are used to exchange I/O.  It can do this over ModbusTCP, but not EtherNet/IP.

Also, on the firmware development side, MQTT will not have received equal attention as their own fieldbus protocols, so it should be expected to be slower.

In essence this is the ‚ÄúSmartphone of Automation‚Äù that @Walker Reynolds  talks about. It‚Äôs a powerful hardware platform that is implemented in a Controller, Motor Drive OR Industrial PC; same architecture in each. Combine this with an operating system, like Android or Apple IOS, where you have an App Store, Github community and Partner Community with many I4.0 & IIOT Companies providing Apps. The ctrlX CORE, the ‚Äòoperating system‚Äô common across the above hardware, is Linux snap based and built around a Data Layer which is essentially its own internal UNS that any App can publish/subscribe to in real time. There is a Codesys App for the traditional Automation projects but you can essentially write applications in any language using any development environment. As it is an automation platform at it‚Äôs heart, there are the usual distributed IO and safety system modules and a whole host of protocols to talk to the rest of the IIOT world.

PLC <- Publisher -> MQTT Broker <--sub-- Counter

What we want is report-by-exception, so the value should only be published when it changed.

How would you do it on startup of the publisher and counter system?
I think the Publisher should publish the current state it observes on startup. Let's say the published boolean is true on startup.

I see two possibilities now:
Either the messages are retained. Then the Counter would store the first message as a current state.
Or the messages aren't retained, so every message is a new observation of the process variable. But in that case, I still couldn't count up, because if the Publisher just started up, it only published its first observation, not an actual change of the signal.

What are your thoughts on this?","",""

Which solution fits depends a bit on how worried you would be about losing track of the count, if the ""truth"" is a variable in the PLC that counts upwards, I'd say using retain in the broker is a very decent option. In that case, if the publisher or counter services restarts or shuts down, when you come back online, as long as the broker is running you'll be initializing the counter service with the last known good value. As soon as that changes, a new value is published and the counter updated. But again, kinda depends on the case.","",""

Depending on your other requirements, you can either add the business logic to calculate the counter-variable either on the publisher, or on the subscriber. I would add persistence to the point where you do the calculation, for example if you wanted to publish the correct counter-variable and not just the boolean, you would add the logic in the publisher. Then you can choose to either rely only on the brokers retain setting, or adding some persistence to the publisher. If you want to publish only booleans, the brokers retain setting isn't going to do you any good, instead you'd need persistence in the subscriber. You could also choose to say that the subscriber has the logic for doing calculations, and then publish the counter value back into the broker.","","üëç (1)"

The publisher should only publish the current process variables.
So the approach is exactly like you mentioned in your last sentence. The subscriber is doing the calculations, persisting it and publishing the counter value back to the broker.

I think I will not retain the process variable and the counter will handle the first message it receives as a current state, remember it and only increment when the value was false and becomes true.","","üëç (1)"

lets imagine now following scenario:
microservice A gets somehow stuck and delays the processing of 10 count messages. B recieves them all at one time, before writing the final state in the retained mqtt message it crashes. now the information of the 10 count messages is lost. with kafka (and some implementation) you can easily ensure that each message is processed exactly once (not only delivered once). in this case B after reboot would automatically reprocess these 10 messages and write the state again (without processing a message twice or never) --> exactly once processing

there are various deviations from this case (microservice gets overloaded with messages, state is calculated by the mean average of the last 100 seconds and then there is a fail;ing microservice, etc.)

I think, for taking a retained value or not on startup, it depends whether you have a highly available broker or just starting out with a few docker containers on a Pi.
In the first case, the last state could be fetched from a retained value, while the latter case would require to publish on startup anyway.

I am of course biased, but visualization of time series data is easy to get started with in Clarify (https://www.clarify.io/). There are many alternatives like https://grafana.com/, https://braincube.com/ or even https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/industry/manufacturing/iot/#overview 

I'll say this though - if you put in the effort of organizing your data in the field, converting your OPC UA tags, metrics from LoraWAN, etc. into a cohesive structure using (for example) MQTT + Sparkplug B - you can test multiple solutions for visualization, and when you want to expand your usage to start with anomaly detection, automatic reporting, combining data from multiple sites etc. You'll have the foundation to build upon instead of re-doing a ton of work organizing your tags in each new system.

It bundled components like node-red, grafana (which is a drag-and-drop visualization tool!), databases that we were planning on using anyway and makes them easier to manage. At the beginning it felt quite complexwith helmet chart / kubernetes, especially as an mechanical engineers, but after spending some time on learning programming it starts to make sense and IT likes it as well. As you seem to be a programmer you might have a better start than me. I have now already connected some Siemens S7 and a rockwell using opc. These videos helped me a lot in getting started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQL05HJ0Q0o","",""

It would be nice with some platform that manages the data structure in a good way and where you don't need that much programming skills to add nodes and stuff but still have the possibility to do more advanced programming if you like.. i will check you examples and see what i can find..

additionally, you can start to structure your node-red flows a little bit (basically making a flow always very short, for example one flow just sending data to mqtt, then one flow just taking it from mqtt, processing it and then returning the result, and then one sending it to other datasources). that alone might provide you with some more overview over node-red.

this might help you in progressing with the project to the point where you can show the impact of that.

"191987346734841856","eddiiee_","2022-07-04T13:55:09.6400000+08:00","Hello guys! I've recently stumbled across a surprising issue in my company. I'm quite new to this discord and the new way of thinking industry 4.0 as well. Been working with industry 4.0 projects like Process control through multivariate data analytics, Object defect detection with machine learning and big data analytics for business. With that said my knowledge in IIoT is limited, but i strive to improve everyday.

Back to the problem. The Digital manufacturing team in IT has sold in a new ""Digital Core"" with the updated ERP, new MES, some other core system for us + ignition as unified name space. This has been implemented at 4 factory sites and are now implemented at 2 sites that I govern over. That's when I figured out that it's not actually the new IIoT architecture they are implementing. They have a traditional integration in an isolated way between ERP, MES, Sharepoint, print&apply and some more. Then they are dumping the datamodel from MES to Ignition to prepare for a future IIoT network. But to my understanding that will create a need for redoing all integrations that currently goes through MES to go through Ignition in firsthand, to strive towards a single source of truth. No one has really been questioning this before since it's the common way of integrating. Do you have any recommendations how I can proceed with this? I have talked with upper management and they agree it's not correct but it's hard to change a decided project spanning over both ERP&MES. I feel I need some quick concrete clarifying results to show why to change. Any suggestions?

TLDR:
1. The IT team has sold in to management that they are implementing IIoT with ignition
2. What we are getting is the traditional automation stack with point to point integrations
3. This has been done at 4 factory sites, now it's time for 2 sites that concerns me
4. They agree with the arguments but that's not enough. How can I show that this is not the future in a concrete way. Suggestions?","",""

Seriously though, the new mesh stuff is great because the repeaters actually have some value aside from just receiving and transmitting, plus you usually have a bunch of wireless sensors between the furthest part and the hub, so you can be pretty sure about the signal strength readings since there will be multiple pathways back.  I remember having to design and install 434MHz point to point systems and getting a reading that was pretty reliable (non-critical systems in a more commercial environment) in commissioning, but once people started walking around the place the signal would start to really degrade, which would usually mean a repeater.

Dinosaurs died and agile creatures (mammals) took over.  About HOW to do DTMA...it still sounded like a teaser... our DTMA is great the other ones are sh*t.

I liked the podcast, but it didn't answer my DTMA questions... I was expecting more of a DTMA revelation....maybe I was naive or fooled by the promise of the title.  One thing though, the first time when the DTMA sh*t list was mentioned in the video, SIRI didn't make it in the sh*t list (flawed assessment processes), the second time it did - with a remark about what NOT to DO - ""I'm not talking about SIRI's assessment in Europe"" (1:13:43 timestamp).

WHY? They work, assess you against meaningful pillars, put you on an I3-4.0 scale, and compare your score with all the major industries.

Seimens is solutions are not perfect , no one company can do all, but the mix of capability they have access engineering to execute and data capture is not matched  by other companies as a one stop shop.

On a concept level it's kinda ok, but when you get into the details it's a real pain in the ass. 
It's quite annoying when you know the tools running there, like docker, but you can't really get your hands on them as the OS is locked down and the only interface you have at your disposal is the web ui.

Yes we support SpB mapping, but not as a direct integration.  For now we would use our flows engine to make this happen.

As for the UNS question, the possibilities are endless.  MQTT is a standard integration, so we can pull data in from any source you connect to and send it to a UNS via the MQTT integration.  Data can be processed using flows beforehand so it's not raw data going to the UNS, and we can adjust reporting to reduce what is being sent (i.e. setup a hysteresis on an analog signal for a report by exception rule).","","üëç (2)"

We have a large install base of Ignition and when looking at Litmus, it's been hard to find enough substantial differentiating factors between the tools, so I wonder if there is a divergence in user base.  While Litmus offers containerization, low code flows, many drivers etc, there is still a hump for us to overcome in terms of ""Ignition could do it, even if not quite as easily"" when justifying cost for an additional or replacement edge platform.  How would you describe the role Litmus plays alongside something like Ignition for data collection and processing at the edge?","",""

"876880919988957205","ryankershaw","2022-09-16T22:16:39.5170000+08:00","Might be.  If many of the applications that are using SpB are in an Ignition environment, we might not be getting the exposure to the demand, so to us it wouldn't seem like there's an urgent need to address.

As for the Ignition vs. Litmus question, it's one that comes up a lot.  Essentially (and remember I'm going to be biased on this one because of the name on my paycheque) it's a SCADA vs. IIoT comparison.  Ignition was born as a SCADA system and does that extremely well, while Litmus was born as an IIoT system and does that extremely well.  SCADA handles single plant applications well, is able to address topics such as recipe management and safety through processes that have been developed through years of experience and implementations.  IIoT handles multi-site applications well, and can make data more accessible and allow for more advanced applications through its ability to gather data and handle it on a large scale basis.  In many applications, we work in parallel with SCADA systems.  We let it handle the day-to-day operations of the plant, and we handle the larger strategic questions and continuous improvement applications.  If you want to make something, use SCADA, if you want to make it better, use IIoT.

If there was one thing I would highlight in the Ignition vs. Litmus discussion, it would be the Litmus Edge Manager (LEM) feature.  LEM doesn't actually work with any pieces of equipment, it only interfaces with any of the deployed edge platforms and allows for central management of the system.  While an organization with only one or two deployments may never touch it, anyone bigger than that considers it to be an essential part to managing the entire system.

Hope that helps!","","üëç (4)"

I like the closed solutions because they have a lot of capability out of the box, but open source is very attractive for the future even though it requires some initially overhead developing some of the components required to match some of the closed IIoT platforms.

It sounds like you have similar background as me, coming from software dev/architecture, and I'm also evaluating different IIoT platforms with a customer.
I'll sum up what I currently know (and remember üòÖ )
We've looked at:
- Azure IoT Hub with IoT Edge runtime (currently in use); A bit too technical for the customer's technicians. I've heard they've also had problems with what the Edge's status really is, says it's online when it in fact it's not. Nice with the docker runtime you can manage remotely and you also get access to some Azure features at the edge like Functions, AzSQL etc.
- AWS SiteWise and Greengrass; Have just been looking into the docs and some videos. The digital thread seems very neat with the asset modelling and such and at least according to Walkers (https://youtu.be/eyDcWPic0Do) it's a bit more open and perhaps easier to make part of a UNS
- Siemens Industrial Edge; Not production ready imho. Built from a bunch of existing open source software but bundled into something not very fluent to use nor debug etc. Simply still in beta if you ask me. Otherwise, on paper it looks good and has a bunch of potentially interesting features.
 - Litmus.io; Haven't got any hands-on experience yet (getting there!) but to me it looks very promising. Compared to Siemens it's quite similar concept but a lot more mature and polished and with more features. One aspect we look at a bit different is that we'd like to do all the configuration from the manager side and just get that pushed to the edge nodes. E.g. making flows (with their node-red) or just configuring the connectors to PLCs and other devices has to be done on the edge itself, but can then be templated and pushed to others. I guess this works, but after seeing how e.g. Crosser and Omnio does the same things in the cloud and just having a docker runtime fetching the changes at the edge, this feels a bit clunky.

Seems like I'm running out of chars to write, so wrapping up here üòÉ","","üëç (1)"

Both Siemens and Litmus.io has their own OS which can either be run on physical hardware or as a VM and thus they handle updates for the whole edge stack. Azure and AWS options are dependent on a linux OS (well Azure IoT Edge can be run on a Windows box, but who would do that :D), so with such a setup you need to have a proper way of patching the OS level too. Ansible could be one option there.
What it boils down to is that you have a bunch of requirements for your specific case and your organization's capabilities. Write them down first! Then look at what boxes the different platforms check and look for other pieces to fill in the blanks. That's at least my take on it üôÇ","",""

Once it's normalized, then out it goes to wherever via an integration.  So, say we connect to the database with the MySQL Server Exporter, which looks to be an official Prometheus exporter.  This would connect via our integrations layer, which would allow us to expose incoming data from the database, or send data back out via this connection.  Once data is in the Litmus platform, then we can send it where it's needed.  In this case, we'll take the incoming data through the flows engine and process it (normalize, analyze, and adjust if needed) and then expose it to (for example) InfluxDB and Graphana via integrations.  InfluxDB will act as the collector and Graphana will handle visualization.  Locally, we have a database in the platform, but that's meant to handle short-term storage for analysis and store and forward capabilities.  Longer term you're going to want to use a specific DB application.

Can a PLC be an edge device? Certainly, any newer PLCs can do this. What is the edge of the network? In IoT it is the end of the IP network. In OT or IIoT, it might be the end of ‚Äúan‚Äù IP network and the edge device may have further IP based connections.  My feeling is that in OT/IIoT edge device is used to designate gateways (protocol gateways). This is the aspect which bringa in the software side, as protocol gateways are inherently tied to software functionalities. A protocol gateway in many cases translatea between multiple communication protocols. For example it polls data out of a PLC over modbus and publishes it to the cloud using MQTT. This is edge driven, that the communication gateway, an edge device in this case) initiates the communication towards the cloud and not vice versa. I do not think it has to do with the ISA model. That is a data model, in an extreme case an edge device can feed data to the Cloud from all the PLCs in one area, that is how the network is defined, it is orthogonal to the data model. Can this edge device functioning as a protocol gateway be a PC? Yes it can, a rugged one running Ubuntu server, docker and Azure IoT Edge, definetly! Can an edge device be a RPi?

In reading about SPE and Ethernet-APL, the complexity of IP-based hardware and firmware is often raised.  This raises the total cost per node.  In the process or life science industries, one can get away with four or figure lab-grade instrumentation that measures out to a 20 decimal places because the process depends on it.  In discrete manufacturing, the process may not require much precision.  In fact, the sensors are often basic switches (e.g., tank level, pressure, temperature).  Many machine builders don't even bother installing analog input cards.

IO-Link, a simple serial protocol for sensors and actuators, has been proposed as a solution to this problem.  It enables sensors to be simple and, most importantly, low cost.  It uses standard unshielded field wiring and does not require costly analog input cards.  The IO-Link interfaces, called ""Masters"", are like 2-4x more economical than analog cards and the associated wiring.  They can be deployed on a fieldbus or standalone with an IoT protocol.  It's not perfect technology.  Depending on the solution, one might have to parse and map in the payloads.  But, the technology is at least really well documented.

What I especially like about the technology is the market adoption.  It's not like specifying unicorn.  What many are using as switches or analog sensors in more traditional deployments (e.g., 0/24VDC, 4-20mA) are actual IO-Link capable sensors.  It's simply a matter of turning on the right configuration and connecting them to an IO-Link Master.  The same transducer and compute inside a sensor that normally generates signals for a PLC input card to interpret can be interfaced with directly and digitally.

But, hopefully this provided an overall picture of relative cost.  This doesn't include the associated costs of shielded field wiring.

What sensors have you found to be more expensive?  My focus is on discrete and automotive.  Outside of motion and safety and metrology, sensors tend to be inexpensive in this space.  Occasionally, some sort of fluid or liquid may need something special.  Process industries are a completely different beast.

When I first began to dabble with IO-Link, I realized a lot of sensors (e.g., pressure, level, flow) used with DI already had IO-Link on it.  The cost was generally about the same.  And, regarding incumbent analog sensors, the pure IO-Link versions were significantly cheaper.  When one considers there was already onboard processing to configure and generate electrical signals for PLCs to consume, it makes sense that it would be more economical to connect to this digitally.

The other area where I might be able to concede it's expensive is on very small machines.  There are segments of the control market where mainstream fieldbus support starts to drop off.  The marginal cost of adding support for a protocol starts to really climb.  Also, these machines tend to be built for low cost of acquisition and not necessarily low total cost of ownership.  The machine builder may steer towards to lower-cost, commodity components.  But, above this extremely price sensitive segment, the differences in cost shrink.

Suppose an asset needs twenty process sensors.  There's an option to use them as switches with digital input modules or IO-Link with an IO-Link Master.  While they're both about a couple hundred dollars, let's assume the total difference for everything came down to a couple grand.  Given the overall acquisition cost of the asset, is it worth stranding all this process data out in the field?","",""
"697134502148964423","trentc","2022-12-01T03:39:38.3830000+08:00","For Digital IO the cost of the sensor is negligible, many MFG have started including IOLink on all of their digital sensors because the cost difference, and value proposition. The added cost is all in the master, Omron NX 4pt digital input module is $73 vs NX IOLink 4pt master is $470. For someone focused on cost per point, you can really drive the cost down using IOLink Hubs with standard IO. This flexibility drives down cost, and still allows one to have IOLink masters in place to utilize when an IOLink capable sensor is chosen.

For analog IO, just for quick reference, Omron NXIO 4ch Analog input is $225 + an IFM pressure sensor for around $143 x 4 total is $797, but if we switch to Omron NX IOLink 4pt master at $470, + 4 IFM IOLink Pressure Sensors at $175 x 4 total is $1170, that's 146% cost of Analog to switch to IOLink. For someone incurring that cost, that isn't leveraging the data or features of the technology, sees this as a hit on the bottom line.

My preference is IOLink as the default because of the data interface capabilities, and when it doesn't work for {reason} then the architecture should allow for the flexibility to adapt. 

I plan to explore more IOLink features adding value further up the stack, as I do see its value. But legacy decision makers don't always feel the same.","","üëç (1)"

I prefer the solution that enables quick time to value, advanced programming capabilities, extensible and easily maintainable. 

For edge uses my preferences
1. Open industrial controller with PLC (Codesys Based) and higher level programming capabilities.
    Rexroth ctrlX (solves most problems in many ways in one uniform package)
    PLCNext (low entry cost, highly programmable, and extensible)
    Opto22 (quickest time to value, solves most problems)
    Wago (open and expandable)

2. Free and Open on low power IPC

We initially used a Beckhoff TwinCat sending MQTT messages to the cloud. but after extensive research and bench (our numerous needs : report by exception support, cheapest, manufacturer rapid support, small size device , easiest, OPC UA support, Azure IoT Edge and IoT Hub support with MQTT , NO Licence, support of internet instability thanks to Edge retrial send policies, no OS so that we don't have to manage OS updates hence instability...), we selected a small basic
Advantech ECU device. 

We spotted some other devices such as IFM or Cloud Rail, and might change in the future, but they are not available right now. 

The main drawback so far of our choice is that the report by exception needs to send flat data (may be Sparkplug will help? However, if we send all data everytime, the data structure remains). 

Appart from this drawback, we can now supervise all machines worldwide. 
Because we need real-time OEE calculations, we collected time series telemetry, it contributes to the digital transformation.

Have an Industrial IoT Edge that combines two advantages :
1) be as flexible as a ruggedized fanless industrial PC with docker containers, running on latest Linux. 
And plenty of features, ex. : Have a Azure IoT Edge agent running full of features ( file upload, certificate management, device lifecycle management, firmware/OS/app update, remote deployments of AI, ...). 

2) be as easy to startup and robust as a PLC  (no OS to update, nearly no security patch to manage). 

Many actors are targeting to ship those two advantages and claim to support that... But the reality Si different from the sheet. 

IFM made a strategic partnership with CloudRail : it leads to one of my favorite IIoT device.... AND only in theory üòÖ because on paper it suits my needs.

Our company manufactures a type of fully integrated linear coil motor that allows for reasonably accurate (back drivable) force control without the need for external load cells/drivers/encoders/etc. We came out of the aerospace/simulation/robotics space and are looking to get a bit more into the industrial automation side of things.

There is nothing special about the one with 4, the special two nodes are in the other cluster. Let's say each cluster has 2 master nodes, which are not isolated (also act as worker nodes). If the 2 servers acting as master in the same cluster fail 1 of your clusters is down for good. If you have one cluster with 10 nodes and 4 masters (the same overall number of masters as before, but now in one cluster) if 2 of them fail the cluster redispatches the resources and works. Also compute is better distributable so it is less likely that a worker node fail will cause compute power insufficiency (in 2 clusters if one node dies and you do not really have enough compute but the other cluster has compute power you have problems).

Thoughts on this library?

I think it is extraordinary.  We have many OS file system type event driven triggers that need subsequent consumption and realtime processing / ai pipeline affecting hundreds of machines across the organization.

I had been using CIFS and other low level protocols such as samba to ingest into a file directory based UNS (ie. I had created a realtime file directory UNS in common with all OS across the company as network drive of files akin to a UNS for these events across all computers in the organization / on network)

I titled it the ""global directory"" being the singular file system for all OS computers on network updated in real time and exporable to all other computers.

To make note, CIFS is working very well for this application, it is immediate and lightweight and bi-directional serving any OS file system on network and easily configurable.

I have a file system monitor on this global directory generating event triggers for any file change on event allowing me to explore any file change in any computer on network in any directory by proxy.

The only problem I am having is prescriptive event triggers on CIFS transfer which is why I think the report by exception model of MQTT would solve this issue in concert with the CIFS protocol or os. libraries specific to python.

This library has the potential to interface with OS file system events and immediately publish events via MQTT to a unified namespace.

How are you all integrating OS file system events into the unified namespace in real time?  There are hundreds of manufacturing machines that do not use PLC OPCUA and rely on file system level data transaction running on a Windows / Mac / Linux operating system.

What I am thinking is to continue using my global directory of CIFS networked computers across all computers on net and then run this library on the entire global directory and immediately pub into MQTT broker.

What do you guys think?","","üëç (1)"

I want to point out a difference between the two that might also help explain the price point.

Aside from being built for the oil and gas industry (ATEX Zone 2 certification, -40 to 158 ¬∞F temperature range, G3 conformal coating, etc.) the SCADAPack 47xi also has a distinctly different internal architecture to PLCNext:

PLCNext has a single CPU (might be multi-core depending on model), which runs a Linux OS, with PREEMPT_RT patch for realtime applications. The IEC61131 logic that controls a machine or process executes as a process thread inside Linux.

The SCADAPack 47xi has two seperate dual core CPUs: one for executing IEC61131 logic and RTU functions, and the other for running the Linux OS. Data is passed between the two through a dedicated link that synchronizes the object databases of both CPUs. The SCADAPack is built this way so that the process control application can reliably execute, unhindered by what might be happening in the Linux OS.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742458745031884921/1078383612178735305/image.png?ex=68df6dc0&is=68de1c40&hm=40b0d96e4dfe1f10530a62d48367d8cbc561530bb49a778deacf8ec15886fa88&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742458745031884921/1078383612493303939/image.png?ex=68df6dc0&is=68de1c40&hm=94582d22849054131709563a70eac0988ea5f317979557abe62e53dc7a759268&",""

Would anyone who has a PLCNext controller be willing to run a small test for me?
The test is:
1. Deploy a small IEC61131 application, with a digital output that switches on/off every second and an analog output that ramps up/down.
2. Use SSH to log into the Linux OS, and execute a fork-bomb (or multiple).
3. Monitor if the digital and analog outputs still behave as expected.

For reference a fork-bomb is a program that recursively forks itself. A simple example is executing the following code in the terminal of Linux: ***A(){ A|A& }; A***
If you want to be even more aggressive, execute this: ***A(){ A|A& }; A; B(){ B|B& }; B; C(){ C|C& }; C***

NOTE: Do not run a fork-bomb on any systems in a production environment (I hope that goes without saying).

That concept developed into edge devices and IoT.

So A truly IIoT plant might not have PLC, but motors and valve that have their own  logic based on the info the pull from the UNS.

But in practice you try to do the best with what you gave. One principal I have taken is that we should model our data as close to the edge as we can. That might be a smart device. Or it might be a PLC , or a gateway device,  or the SCADA. Or in  broker in the old. But if it is in the cloud and that is as close to the edge I am happy inhabe followed my principles.

For IIoT ideally to me there is no central computer. Doing all the work. Just smart nodes. If I need to take dumb devices and transform them into Virtual Smart Devices in the PLC layer I am OK with that too.

Very few applications genuinely need the tight integration of running two applications on the same CPU or backplane. A lot can be handled across Ethernet. BUT, that is another engineered interface and typically the hardware costs are higher when using two devices instead of one. 

I have another concern about shoving Edge Computing and Process Control into the same box:
Typically, PLCs have a very long lifespan 10+ years (some even 20+).  But, the lifecycle of typical IT hardware is much shorter - people don't use the same phone / laptop / workstation for 10+ years. Ever evolving software drives the need to upgrade hardware more frequently. So, if you put both PLC and Edge Computing applications into one controller now, will you face some tough choices 5 years later? Will there be some new demanding edge computing application that you want to deploy, but can't, because that would mean upgrading the entire PLC, instead of just an edge computer next to a traditional PLC.

In searching for controllers that support MQTT, most of the devices I've come across are some form of Linux implementation. I've only seen that some Codesys based PLCs support MQTT without the need for Linux. I'm not sure why that is.

From this brochure it seems that the Opto22 Epic runs a single 4-core CPU. It might be that the process control logic executes on one core and the Linux OS executes on the other cores, but I doubt it. If the process control logic is hosted as a thread inside the Linux OS, then the same vulnerability could also exist. I know a guy who has an Opto22 controller - don't know if it is a Groov Epic. I'll see if I can convince him to run a small test for us.

To be clear, a fork-bomb is fairly simple to protect against, by setting the ulimit parameter in Linux. I merely used it to simulate someone deploying a defective application onto the controller, which then overwhelms the CPU. I did this to illustrate that hosting process control logic inside a Linux OS, requires of you to also be a Linux expert, in order to ensure that your applications are reliable.

I guess if you don't want to become a Linux expert, you could put your faith in the OEM. But you would have no way of validating that the OS they give you out of the box is fit for your particular use case.

One of the key features these Linux based controllers promote is easy centralised deployment of containerised applications.

This reminded me of the Node-RED nodes published by Schneider. Instructions to install the nodes from the SE Repository can be found here: https://ecostruxure-data-expert-essential.se.app:4873/
Alternatively you can request the offline installers for the nodes here: https://ecostruxure-data-expert-essential.se.app:3000/se-nodes

The two nodes I use most are se-node-red-modbus and se-node-red-aveva_insight, to grab data from our PLCs and send it to Aveva Insight. But of course you can send any data to Insight from any device via a HTTP-Post request. In the attached screenshots, I adapted the Node-RED flow of my home Raspberry Pi, which logs weather data to a local InfluxDB, to also send the data to Aveva Insight.
Here is a link to my data: https://online.wonderware.com/s/ca647465-9261-4f76-ac7e-e5c5353df34a/Explore/Analysis/ac4ERMb6HtUOBasEXYL4UrQ/Embed

If anyone wants to play around with Aveva Insight, simply create an account (for free) and you can create a solution that runs in trial mode for 45 days. Then you can stream your data to Aveva from your own Node-RED applications.Formatting the data for consumption by the se-node-red-aveva_insight node takes some fiddling, so let me know if you want my flow as an example. Or, you can watch this very good video by @Kudzai Manditereza  https://youtu.be/E4e4Nzlc_p4

**In particular, I am curious to get this community's opinion on the OEE calculation facility in Aveva Insight. Seeing as I know absolutely nothing about MES, I also don't have any meaningful data to feed into Insight. Would anyone here be willing to stream some data (real or simulated) to Insight and configure an OEE calculation, to tell me what you think of it?**","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742458745031884921/1083327523653435422/Node-RED_to_Aveva_Insight.png?ex=68def520&is=68dda3a0&hm=7f109ce5404b62ec07048e108147edc2c94e092ef435cbc8d28f19ca20e31f63&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742458745031884921/1083327523921874954/Aveva_Insight_Dashboard.png?ex=68def520&is=68dda3a0&hm=874fab1cc8e917c6a00f9d1ede23e23a50f6f1aec1edd3076da7a2ec20a63abf&","üíØ (1)"

Bridging the gap between OPC and MQTT is essential to meet the need for efficient data analysis in the enterprise. A firmware-optimized gateway can provide this bridge and mitigate the incompatibility of the two protocols, allowing you to capitalize on the strengths of both protocols in a secure and reliable way. I think in most cases, it is important for OT stewards of OPC connectivity to remain accountable for real-time streaming data while providing a secure and reliable way to move data up the analysis stack. An onsite MQTT broker can be used to forward tags to an enterprise MQTT broker, enabling real-time enterprise and data stream needs to be met without sacrificing OT ""Real-time"" SCADA needs and local data science granularity.

I am searching for terms to addresses struggles I had working with a popular Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) implementation. Addressing granularity mismatch and visibility gaps between asset utilization and item production is essential for optimizing efficiency and decision-making. I am looking into proposing that minute-level granularity and edge processing could be viable solutions to these challenges. 

Possible useful terms?

Granularity mismatch: Harmonizing data granularity across job operations, asset utilization and item production would improve data accuracy and enable advanced optimization strategies, benefiting the entire production process.

Visibility gap: Minute-level granularity would provide more accurate insights into the production process, enabling better-informed decisions and agile responses to changing conditions.

Resolution enhancement: Improved time resolution of MES data would pinpoint and resolve issues, resulting in a more robust and reliable system.

Scalability: Minute-level granularity would maintain a balance between granularity and scalability by limiting data transmission and storage without compromising system performance.

By adopting a reference MES specification that incorporates minute-level granularity at the edge, organizations can revolutionize how they handle real-time data in MES systems, positioning them at the forefront of their industries.

I would like to move micro-stops to the Performance metric vs. Availability, you could think of it like pulse modulation.  So often on fixed speed equipment the P number of OEE doesn't tell you much, this would make it more useful.  This is a critical part of the concept.  So if you wanted to dive into these small events you would focus more on OT resources, think of it like a dividing line between OT vs IT/Realtime Enterprise. 

Conversely when the IT side tries to deal with this level of granularity problems emerge.  Latency issues make issues that are hard to mitigate. If a PLC doesn't debounce event state properly the chatter can create a flood of small events, that overload the MES system's abilities to record them.","",""

If it's for something like an employee badge scan, you could have the reader write to a text field in a front end (e.g., Tulip) and then pass it down to Intelligence Hub.

USB requires some driver knowledge of the reader.  If you can expose as an TCP or COM port in the OS, that might open more opportunities for connectivity.

Another option is to get an Ethernet-based reader with TCP/IP.  I'm sure the Kepware UCON driver or Real Time Automation gateway could parse the payload.  Another option is to look into a simple serial-based reader.  A Real Time Automation gateway could pick this up.  From there, gateways can publish to an MQTT broker.","",""

We (Portainer.io) will soon make our latest project, k2d.io available for early testing, and as its a radical approach to Kubernetes at the edge, I'm hopeful it gets some pretty awesome traction. We tried to make k3s, k0s, MicroK8s work on really lightweight IIOT/IOT devices, but they just use too many resources...

I have a blog about it the ""why"" of k2d here: https://www.portainer.io/blog/announcing-k2d.io

This is not designed to replace the lightweight Kube distro's, its to bring the best of Kube to devices that are not really capable of running Kube.

The application should be able to work on any hardware. Operators valued the ease of use and comfort.

we went with the Zebra ET51 with scanner expansion. and it was great. One of the big tasks as part of the MES implementation was barcode scanning, both for raw material, but also for reworking reject. we had up to 4 labels and 6 barcodes on a bottle being filled. Scanning with an Ipad camera, or any tabled standard tablet, is not ideal. 
They come with a very ergonomic handle so it is easy for operators to have them on their hands longer durations. They had nice mounting cradles. secure and easy to clip into. The only issue was that they didn't charge in the cradle, but we worked around that very easily the batteries are hot swappable, so we batteries and chargers at each filler. And there was a set of spare batteries in a charger in the operations mangers offices, to catch the unforeseen issues of broker charger or people forgetting to swap.

We had ATEX versions too IFRC, though they didn't have the integrated scanner. 

 Another plant for the same company had iPads and they worked ok, but with the cases for ATEX they were more cumbersome and that plant had a lot less barcodes to scan.","",""

We started working on an Event-driven / UNS-type architecture in Litmus Edge in the 2017 timeframe. 
The choices then were 0MQ, Some MQTT brokers, Some AMQP brokers, Kafka & NATS. 

**Our Tech criteria:**
1. Needs to be standalone and capable of running in a constrained environment (Edge)
2. Need to work in airgap on OT level 2 / 3
3 Single binary - No Java or Python dependency hell
4. Performance 100k msgs / second minimum (2018 requirement) - we scaled to 1 MM msgs /second no problem 
5. Binary Wire Pubsub protocol (no need of anything complex like MQTT / AMQP)
6. Strict controls and security on bi-directional communication (aka write back to PLCs)

Business criteria : 
In 2018, we created 6 teams in Litmus. 
1. 1 Team - DeviceHub - deal with all industrial connectivity. 
2. 4 teams - Ready Analytics & Contextualization, Integrations, Container Marketplace & Flows (Node-red). All different components inside Litmus Edge.
3. 1 Team - Central management, aka Litmus Edge Manager
4. They all HAD to work completely asynchronously (like UNS consumers), and they were launching features left and right.

5. Devicehub (industrial drivers) Team created the ""contract"" -> here is the data schema, here is the topic layout, here is the discovery, here is the data & here are the security laws. Go figure. 

Our tests and results:
1. NATS does not die on you - it crawls the last byte in memory, screams, shouts, and complains, but it will not die on you! You can't say the same for most of the other brokers out there.
2. Scales very linearly. More resources -> more performance
3. They added a lot of security, HA, and other features after joining CNCF - we hit the lottery with those in 2020. Synadia team is spearheading it amazingly.
4. Over the last 7 years, Billions of industrial tags and topics created across all customer installations, NATS never failed us.

Lots of people just think MQTT brokers are the way to go in IIoT - nope, there are better things out there.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (3)"

The Kepware driver works well for read/writing to registers (e.g., R1000.1).  It's limited with the generic FOCAS objects.  For these reasons, it's best to work with the machine builder what the underlying addresses are.  If this doesn't work, try supplementing with Fanuc's gateways or the open source MT Connect Adapter.  They tend to be the more complete with respect to the generic FOCAS objects.

I find that this issue is not just a driver problem, but also a machine builder problem.  A lot of machine builder's implementations of Fanuc vary signficantly.  They often elect to build something outside of what Fanuc prescribed in their platform.  Instead of licensing a feature (e.g., tool management), they'll build it themselves in the C Language Executor or Ladder III engine.  Of course, none of it is documented or has a description.  The data is either hidden in the C runtime or in an unlabeled register.

Potential options:
-Ask the machine builder ""what is the address of the register for [machine function X]?""
-Try the Fanuc gateways (e.g., FASOPC, MT Connect Server). Works best with ""vanilla"" Fanuc machines (e.g., Robodrill).
-Try the open source FOCAS MT Connect Adapter on github
-Try working with one of the machine tool IoT companies such as VIMANA / System Insights, Machine Metrics, etc. Perhaps they might license their data acquisition tools independent of their broader analytics platforms.","",""

Inductive Automation: Misplaced under data ingestion instead of IoT platform, where it is number 1 ranked.
MuleSoft: More suitable as business integration software rather than IoT.
AR VR Companies: Only Google, Meta, and Immersed VR are appropriate.
Microsoft (in VR context): Shouldn't have been included in VR, since they closed down their VR lab and laid off 11,000 people.
Zoho: Incorrectly included under remote asset access.
Apache: Should have been on data ingestion side rather than the message brokers/protocol converters side.
Siemens: Potential overrepresentation or misrepresentation.

Kepware (PTC): Omitted but no. 1 software on the edge.
Litmus Automation: Omitted mistakenly.

Rockwell: Missing from Edge device and remote access sections.
Opto 22 and Phoenix Contact: Omitted mistakenly.
SEEK: Omitted mistakenly 
Frameworx: Omitted, but should at least feature on edge component and was meant to be a replacement for what became of AVEVA Edge.

- I made a python script to simulate a machine and give me a WO, Status, a Good count, a Bad count, a Total Count, Uptime Downtime, and post them to Modbus. ( all good here)
I then used node red to read the values from Modbus, and Publish them to my MQTT broker. and Calculate quality and Availability and post that to MQTT too.( I'll get to Performance, later) No problem there. 
 I set up my Topics in Node red as spBv1.0/Ent/Site/Area/Line/Machine/DDATA/Node/Device . And when I used a client to look at the Broker I nice nested Ent/Site/Area/Line/Machine with all my metrics in my int he Machine. So I though Great stuff here.
But Canary connects to the broker and can't subscribe to any topics, with a""bit"" of trial and error( and error and error) I found out I coudl make it work my Topic is SpBv1.0/Ent/DDATA/Node/Device

Great.  No need for an external gateway.  If it's not possible to curate the right payload, it might make sense to look into an external solution.

Maintainability is another aspect to consider.  For example, if you find it's too tedious to modify a function block in TIA Portal, it might be optimal to use an external gateway.  I've personally found some onboard ""IoT"" protocol interfaces have shortcomings with respect to management interfaces and performance.  Third-party solutions, ironically, can often do this better.

While things are slowly improving, it seems that PLC vendors think of IoT connectivity as an afterthought.  I suspect they may purchase an interface SDK and bolt it on their product without much thought on configuration and performance.  For these reasons, the native protocol can be significantly more performant and easier to work with. 

In real world scenarios, I've generally found Kepware's drivers work better than onboard OPC UA Servers or MQTT Clients.  If the payload needs to be shaped and done at scale, HighByte works well.  It's also easier to maintain.  Life cycling integrations is more challenging using a variety of firmware-specific PLC programming software.","",""

Every few meters, there are assets with three phase power, air lines, water lines, gas lines, etc.  Just moving an asset can cost anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.  The facilities have the utilities and infrastructure to support the assets.  In this context, running Ethernet to assets is trivial.  There is not really a scarcity of power or networks.

Most of the interoperability problems in manufacturing stem from semantics.  The presentation of data is different in every asset, app, etc.  It's challenging to make the payloads usable.  The secondary challenges are transport protocols.  Almost no one is worried about the physical media (or wireless networks).

The problems with sensors are usually around integrating them into control systems.  Installing shielded cables and analog input modules for PLCs is costly.  There often isn't room inside of electrical panels or the PLC does not have spare capacity.  If bypassing the control system, the challenges are contextualizing the sensor data and merging it with asset data.  There are tons of standalone sensors solutions that are lower cost, but there is an integration cost of making that data usable.

LoRaWAN doesn't really solve a problem that most manufacturers have.  It's just another field network.  They convert these all the time.  The merits of one field network technology over another matter less than having fewer of them and reducing their support burden.  Being able to easily discover, browse, and use the data sent over a network is more important than how it's delivered.  This is what that the telecom and networking companies fail to understand when they try to go to market in industry.","",""

I consider these applications closer to non-industrial IoT and less IIoT / I4.0.  LoRaWAN excels in these applications because there generally isn't infrastructure in place.  There is a scarcity of network and power resources.  A construction yard or trucking company aren't going to have teams to support this stuff.

LoRaWAN could have some merits in some low-tech manufacturing with low levels of automation.  I'm sure there exist off-the-shelf solutions that non-technical teams in operations could deploy for continuous improvement projects.  Though, in a broader digital transformation context, this could be creating a data silo long term.

Process industries and utilities might benefit from LoRaWAN.  They generally have a scarcity of networks and low voltage power.  Their assets are widely distributed.  Having low voltage power available for instrumentation is probably the greatest challenge.  This is why they generally prefer field network technologies that can also deliver power.

Wireless networks in manufacturing are interesting.  They're incredibly useful for supporting functions (e.g., material handling, shipping/receiving, collaboration, inspection, programming automation).  In practice, they're less useful for assets.  Control systems are generally wired and deep in electrical panels.  Setting aside performance and reliability concerns, the cost of bridging a resilient WiFi network to many wired field networks exceeds the cost of running structured cable.","",""

I have seen examples of network drops costing $1500 each and even more if switches don't have available ports.  Also, older equipment may not have ethernet ports.  Many equipment are custom and typically there is little documentation, if any, about the plc code.    It takes months to setup infrastructure, connect with OEMs to get info  and  connect to equipment.

Its evident that LoRaWAN is not suitable for large volumnes of real-time monitoring, its just not designed for that purpose. Instead, we use protocols such as HTTP, MQTT, or OPC-UA, depending on the architecture. The MQTT brokers we use can handle millions of messages per second on small footprint appliances. I agree with Ehab that many applications require a certain type of monitoring where one minute, five minutes, or even one message per hour is sufficient. In many cases, it is much cheaper to drop wireless sensors, even if the equipment has a local screen.

LoRaWAN is not intended to replace real-time data networks or ideal for most manufacturing cases. However, it is an excellent new onion layer in the world of data capture. When combined with edge computing, it provides an economical and quick-to-deploy solution, sometimes outside the scope of the network, which is critical for pilots.

Nevertheless, LoRaWAN is fantastic for asset tracking, facilities management, air quality or sound monitoring, and EPA or OSHA reporting. It is also useful for counting and predictive maintenance on rotary equipment, among other places where reaching out is dangerous, complicated, or cabling is not an option.","",""

I think it's important to mention that infrastructure is ""expensive"" when it's built for a one-off project.  It's not ""expensive"" when it's built out as infrastructure.  For example, a plant should have a distribution frame every 100m with structured cabling.  This reduces the total and marginal cost of adding nodes to a network.  Similar things are done with power, compressed air, water, etc.  They're installed in a such a way that brings down the cost of extending and deploying these resources.  

Infrastructure is stood up to make other projects possible and not cost prohibitive.  The ROI of infrastructure is indirect and benefits multiple things.

To do that they need the requisite tools to manage the sensors. Management includes changing configuration if needed.  Setting alarm points and all the other good stuff. To effectively do that then you need to publish a data object that supports that goal.   Right now you have to essentially custom build that functionality into tools like Ignition. What would make that process a bit more seamless is if the device had a self describing nature built into it. This functionality would obviously have to exist at the master level.  The counter argument to this is to give them the native IFM tools to perform the management functions. I'm not a fan of that as it gives them access to all of the other sensor devices used for other general automation aspects.

The MQTT.fx app examines the MQTT messages and indicates the ""BIRTH"" messages which establish the connection. Then after 15 minutes the ""DEATH"" message appears.

At one edge of the spectrum, if the interface is intuitive enough for a controls engineer to manage day-to-day himself after being setup by an OT network group, then I consider that an OT SDN solution.

At the other edge of the spectrum, if the interface is complicated (lots of pages to cycle through, lots of levers to configure, etc) where a dedicated team is required to manage it on behalf of controls engineers, then I consider this an IT SDN solution...even though it may be used within an OT-type environment.

The organizational structure of a business is what will drive which type of solution is most appropriate to use....and I get the sense that the majority of manufacturers need a solution that controls engineers can be empowered to manage.

I'm curious to hear what others think....

In a large organization I would be **shocked **if Controls Engineers were authoring/updating IOS configs and remoting into switches and deploying them.

Consider that a SDN deployment allows the team to lock down network access, where devices are identified and authorized to only communicate with other identified devices.  The concept here is to bring firewall capability to every switch port.

Given this scenario, I would say the controls engineers that know the machine are best suited to identify what devices should be on teh network, and what connections should be happening between those devices.  So I see the controls engineer being able follow a workflow to:
(1) create groups of devices (PLC, IO, HMI, etc)
(2) create communication flows between groups (protocols, directionality, etc)
(3) identify devices on the network, and assign to these groups.

Given a deny-by-default posture, I also view the controls engineer needing the ability to sustain the SDN system over the life of the machine, as components are added to the network, or components need to be replaced whcih have new unique identifiers.

1. Duplication in the GroupID and Edge NodeID.  I have only one CMT-SVR device I'm testing, but while the physical device used the programmed GroupID and Edge NodeID, when I ran the device in ""online simulation mode"" to modify tag values to see they propagated to the broker properly, this simulated device also used the same GroupID and Edge Node ID causing the conflict and multiple instances of stale data, Message Sequence number ERROR messages in the logs and rebirths . When I changed the Edge NodeID before running the simulator so it didn't conflict with what was programmed in the physical device the issue went away.

2.  The namespace error:  I had been following the ""Building a UNS Part 1"" video in the mastermind series and about an hour into the video Walker had us add a custom namespace called ""All"" subscribing to ""#"".  This caused the sparkplug payload to conflict and give the ""unable to handle payload on custom namespace"" error in the logs.  I temporarily have changed this custom namespace to subscribe to ""EverythingElse/#"" until I work through the rest of the series to see the best way to configure the tag structures/namespaces.

 I‚Äôm new to this and am testing the cMT-SVR-200 to publish data from the COM2 port.

Issues I'm Facing:
GroupID and NodeID in Ignition:

When I use longer topics for GroupID (e.g., Enterprise/Site/Area/Line) and NodeID (Edge), Ignition Engine doesn‚Äôt read the SPB messages.
With single-word GroupID and NodeID, Ignition reads the messages, but it places NBirth, DBirth, and NDeath too high in the topic hierarchy. Is this expected behavior for an edge device?
Automatic Publishing of ""Local HMI"" Device:

When GroupID is set to Enterprise and NodeID to Site, Ignition can read and show the tags in the MQTT engine, but the device always publishes the ""local hmi"" topic, even if it‚Äôs empty, and it doesn‚Äôt publish the COM2 port tags.
This results in the ""local hmi"" name appearing at the Area level in the SPB message.
Questions:
Is there a way to resolve these issues, or am I misconfiguring the setup?
If I start adding devices this way, will it mess up the hierarchy in my UNS?
Any advice or solutions would be greatly appreciated.","",""

Some things that got me tripped up were:  Tweaking PLC settings and left it in program mode and not run mode, oops !,  and doing a ""clean program"" to get rid of the HMi demo stuff, but not setting up the sparkplug registers.  In the sparkplug demo, the data you enter for the MQTT setup is loaded to HMI registers & I believe and these are displayed on the demo, but the HMI interface, specifically the start button is programmed to push a 1 to the correct register to open the actual connection to the broker.  So if you aren't doing an online simulation and aren't getting any data, check this.  If you are simulating and also have the software running, make sure the Edge Node ID on your physical device and your ""online simulation"" are different so they don't cause a conflict.

A few years ago, I bought the AutomationDirect MQTT gateway (SGW-MQ1611) and have been using it to the best of my knowledge as part of my Unified Namespace (UNS). This device only works with flat MQTT, which has been great, but I decided it's time to move up to Sparkplug B (SPB).

Based on Walker‚Äôs recommendations in various videos, I decided to try the cMT-SVR device from Maple Systems.

Currently, I have 25 industrial oven controllers connected to the MQTT gateway over serial COM (Modbus RTU). For my online testing with the cMT-SVR, I created a simple HMI screen in EasyBuilder Pro, version V6.09.01.524 (the version is important because it allows me to export and import tags via Excel; otherwise, it would be a massive pain to create 100+ tags manually).

I connected my laptop to my oven devices via serial COM 4 (configured in the system parameters tab before trying the actual hardware) and ran the online simulation. I verified that the HMI screen shows real-time data from my devices, and I checked via Ignition Edge to see if it is publishing the SPB data.

When I run the online simulation, it shows that it is publishing the SPB messages under the ""local_hmi"" topic (even if you don't have any tags set up in SPB). However, the tags I created for my ""local_device_2"" (the device set up on COM2 or COM4 for PC) are not being published to the broker.

This is my current situation with the cMT-SVR. I have reached out to Maple Systems to see if they can spot an issue in my current setup or if something else is going on. It doesn't make sense that it's not publishing anything from that local device.

I wonder if the issue has to do with the import/export beta version they let me use for the SPB tags in EasyBuilderPro.","",""

What I experienced was the UNS would show the PLC as active when the PLC published data to the COM port and the HMI was stale/red/empty and when I published HMI data, the HMI would rebirth and the PLC data would then be red/stale/empty and so on.

When I ran into this issue, it was because the Group ID and Edge Node ID from **the physical CMT MQTT configuration** that I downloaded to the CMT was conflicting with **the Online Simulation MQTT configuration** Group ID and Edge Node ID. What I experienced when they were the same was I would get multiple disconnects and rebirths of the edge node.  So log into your Ignition Gateway and check the STATUS, DIAGNOSTICS, LOGS for a message similar to this:  Failed to handle the DDATA message for SpBv1.0/[YourGroupID]/DDATA/[YourEdgeNodeID] with a + symbol next to it and that plus when expanded would tell you ""Message Sequence Error..."".  if this is the case, you have to change your Edge Node ID or Group ID in MQTT configuration BEFORE launching the simulation so it is different than the CMT.","",""

In sparkplugB world, is there a ""Node Discovery"" feature?

I have this scenario:
1. Primary host application STATE online
2. Edge node published node NBIRTH
3. A second host application (custom that we are developing) goes online and wants data from every node on the network, but got late to the party and Edge node already advertised itself.

Question: without listing every node on the second host application, how could this one discover the edge node?
If it were listed, we could simply use the Node Control/Rebirth. But that is not the case. 
I can't find anything in the specification related to this.

If you dont subscribe to the topics of the edge node you wont get any of the data from it, for you it wouldnt exist. The broker is the one will send you the current state of everything you subscribe to, you dont bother the Edge node when your second host come online.

"794020366536146977","mparris","2024-07-18T23:43:27.5300000+08:00","The only dynamic way to discover is to do a wildcard subscription to the Sparkplug namespace ""spBv1.0/#"", or ""spBv1.0/<groupID>"" if you know the groupID of interest is known,   and then wait for NDATA or DDATA packets to come in.

 When a *DATA packet comes in, your application could issue a Rebirth request, to receive all the possible metrics (variables) and their current value. This method of discovery, however, is not guaranteed to be immediate, especially if a node has slow -changing data, you won't see a *DATA packet until that change.

Look in the spec for the idea of a ""Sparkplug-aware broker"". HiveMQ may be the only one that implements this function. 

The idea is that the broker can store all the NBIRTH and DBIRTH and make them available on separate, RETAIN=true topics. So using this broker and having the clients subscribe to those special topics allows immediate discover, but you have the problem of the values on the birth certificate being almost certainly stale. So, your client application will know if the nodes, what metrics they have available, but will not know the current value until a new *DATA comes to it. 

Because Sparkplug was designed for a single application to receive all data, and didn't design accommodations for other, distributed clients (secondary hosts), this is the best you will get today.

This whole mechanism, however, should be revised in the new version of Sparkplug:

I‚Äôve not read the fine details of the spec, but in practice a host application will subscribe to ddata, ndata, dbirth and nbirth of either the entire SpB Namespace, or specific group or node topics (depending on if its host to all of SpB, or a subset of group(s) or node(s)). When and if the host recieves data from an Edge node of which it does not have a birth, it should issue a rebirth command to the node.

There is a huge difference if the host application is the Primary Host Application, because the edge node must wait for it having a STATE online=true to publish NBIRTH.
As MParris wrote, waiting for NDATA/DDATA and issue a rebirth can lead to a long wait time before the state of that node can be know. Is a possible solution, but not viable to our case. 

While we wait for Sparkplug new version, we are considering A) the use of a Sparkplug aware broker; B) or extending the specification by publishing a NSTATE retained message from edge nodes (similar to the host application STATE), NDEATH would indicate it is no longer valid, C) Having the Primary Host Application to keep a registry of the Nodes and publishing it

From an information theory perspective, primary host doesnt change a lot, because its Edge nodes that defines who is primary host, so when a host enters the network, it itself doesnt know if its primary host to anything and is equally ignorant to the presence or non-presence of nodes as it enters the network, so it has to sub to the same topics. The only difference is that it doesnt have to wait for data payloads from nodes it is primary host for as they will publish births when it enters the network. Anyway its not very important in practice, particularly if you assume all Edge nodes have the same primary host. (Btw primary host is not mandatory, we didnt use primary host the first two years we had SpB). 

How much of a problem is this reallly going to be in practice? We have our Edge nodes publishing at 1 second intervals, so the longest time non-primary hosts have to wait is 1 second.

In our case we have considered not having a Primary Host Application, but then even the Primary Host Application would have to wait for *DATA to discover the network (or we would have to provide it with the listing of nodes, and they are dynamic). Furthermore, we don't wan't edge nodes publising their data into vacuum. When primary host is offline, it must cache data and later publish as historical. 

Losing a sample or two is not a problem, but we are using RBE, and some data only changes every hour, or day. We cannot afford to wait that long to discover nodes and their state.

Why SpB? it fits very well in our use case. Single Source of truth, Decoupled Data, Immediate Discovery. Since it is an open specification, others can develop as well software to integrate in the solution, as well as we would like to use as much already available software as possible.

the resolution (pre patch or maintenance release) is to add a dependency for the event log service to wait for the key service to be done before it starts up. A Windows Admin can run the following command in Windows CMD/Terminal:

sc config KEPServerEXLoggerV6 depend= KEPServerEXKeySvcV6

this relates to competition between keyservice and server_eventlog attempting to access a file at the same time, and the server_runtime fails to start because of it.

looks like we are adding this to our upcoming maintenance release for 6.16, and support could cut you a patch for 6.15 if you need to stick with it","","üëç (3)"

We are facing a challenge in a project connecting a soldering machine weich is 20 years old. I was wondering if somebody could give us an advice on our questions.

Unfortunately in pur company,  knowledge about the plc program was always managed by the machine builders so we are are pretty blind...

Here is our approach:
1. Identify the PLC type in order to select a software  which has a driver which is able to connect. (E.g. Kepware)
2. Ask at the machine vendor for a list with all used adresses within the the PLC
3. Configure the software with all the tags and select the data we would like to get from the machine (temperature, O2 concentraion, machine state, counter) 

A question/precaution that was mentioned by a colleague was that we lose the warrenty of the machine if we read the PLC in that manner.

I would highly appreciate advice from an experienced fellow here since we are all quite young in our team but try to make it work somehow.

Thank you in advace!","",""
"1073312001788477471","sparkylarks","2024-11-09T20:02:14.2040000+08:00","the ideal approach would be to contact the machine builder, and ask them and they either
- give you a map to get the key data
- Do some modifications to prepare the data and send it to whatever system you want.
- if it is a built to order machine, provide you a copy of the code

Bitter experience is that Machine builders ask about$15 to 20k per machine to do that.

So I think the Kepware approach is good.
have you a picture of the PLC and especially the front to see if it is ethernet or serial( 20 years old might not have an ethernet port).
Warranty should not be affected if you read data from the machine. If it is 20 years old is it still overed by warranty?

 If you can get access to the PLC code, you should be able to find out the key values, pretty quickly, or hire someone who could do so . The Temp and 02 probably have instruments, that you can see where they are wired to in the PLC
if there comments and tag name in is reasonable you can find the counter and state, if count can be simple to find if there is a value on a HMI, State can bo ok to find, but sometimes hard to decode, but you can get the main one, Idle, Running etc.

Good luck with it","",""

1st step is to open (or have someone open) the panel. Find the brand and part number of the PLC. 

From there go to Google and see what software is used to program that PLC, there should be 20 years of forums complaining about it so that's a good start. 

After that you need to get a 
hold of the software, this may be tricky... And may be stupid expensive.

Once you get the software you need to figure out how to connect, a 20 year old PLC is probably a serial or some proprietary cable. 

After you are online, I hope that you can upload the program without the original file. Best case scenario you will get online with it. Most likely you won't have any tag names, symbol descriptions, or comments. Worst case you can't upload without the original file. 

Assuming you get online without comments, the next step is to take the IO list / panel drawings (if you have them) and reverse engineer the code until you get what you need. 

If you don't have any IO lists or drawings, then you need to trace back the wires and reverse engineer that first.

You could attempt the same process with the HMI but I doubt a 20 year old HMI will have many options for connectivity.

I oversimplified this process a bit for brevity... Honestly, $30,000 is not that bad for a job like this (depending on the machine). I'm assuming that the OEM will have to send someone onsite to do some version of this exact scenario... Odds are that there have been changes over the years, so anything the OEM has on hand is likely not up to date.","","üëç (1)"

I have seen people claim to sniff the packed being communicated and be able to extract the data, but I have never seen it successfully done

It might work for Modbus Comms, to the HMI etc. but the data you want would have to be transmitted.

What I have seen done in similar situratiosn is iinstall a small PLC, and take the inputs to the OLF PLC and wire them into the new PLC for signals you are interested in i.e. Temp, AI, Pulses etc. and then wire the NEW PLC outputs int the old PLC inputs.

1) What is the difference between the two ""edge"" channels on this Discord? Wasn't sure which one fits my questions better.
2) In your projects, in order to get data out of the machines that don't natively connect to the rest of the data infrastructure, do you push for many small edge devices/gateways, or a big central server for the entire site running some platform with protocol converters? Or is this entirely dependent on the existing infrastructure (i.e. is it even possible to run everything directly to a central server)?
3) If using many smaller devices, how are you managing updates, both for the applications and the IPC/device firmware itself? I assume the applications nowadays involve some sort of containerization and can be deployed/updated remotely. Is it important for your edge devices to allow mass OTA updates of the underlying OS? Or is each device handled individually, by an actual person connecting to it over the network or, god forbid, using a USB stick?

1) If system/device has any other API (like SOAP, TCP/IP) I created simple translating app and hosted it. 
2) If system/device you want to integrate has accessible db you can write custom api with REST API as layer of abstraction to db.
3) For devices that supports industial protocols you can for example use MOXA AIG. It allows you to specify for example Modbus TCP device and you can access created tags with values using moxa's built-in rest api.  I think this advantech ecu-1051 would also fits the needs

for 1 and 2 you can also use Ignition and with it's web server module capabilities create REST API.
