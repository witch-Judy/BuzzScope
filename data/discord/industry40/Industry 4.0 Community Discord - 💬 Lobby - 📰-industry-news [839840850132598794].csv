It makes use of Data Access, method calls, and subscriptions to Events. To get data, you can subscribe to a single tag, but for higher speed applications where timing matters, there is an event that a client can subscribe to, where the data is sent asynchronously, like MQTT. This overcomes the inherent latency with poll/response of subscribing to a tag with a fixed publish rate.

I know of three companies that sell products making use of this spec.","",""

The OPC foundation did a good job identifying many spec organizations in different industries and getting them to sign on.  What are people seeing in practice?  Are machine vendors implementing OPC UA servers on the machine and adopting the specs?  Are OPC Server companies or third party companies implementing translation layers between the native equipment and OPC Server that converts the tags to the OPC companion spec?","","üî• (1),highbyte (2)"

*With the collaborative network, we‚Äôre working on shared enterprise data from concept all the way through design, manufacturing and operational support‚Ä¶ eventually live operational support [of aircraft] via 5G technology. This is near real-time engineering design with 3D design tools from concept to plant-floor robotic controls and live feedback in iterative loops.*

They want ‚Äúhigh-efficiency‚Äù engineering, to end re-work, radically speed the technical review process, and provide predictive maintenance on delivered systems. 

Interestingly, they refer to their process as ‚Äúdigital thread.‚Äù

Quote from their web page on it---
‚ÄòEngineers are finding the digital thread creates a new understanding that cuts out a lot of busy work.
‚ÄúWe spend a lot of time and effort upfront writing detailed requirements before a project can begin,‚Äù said Conklin. ‚ÄúWith digital engineering, we try to start coding on Day One. We use the lessons of the coding to inform requirements. I think that Raytheon Intelligence & Space comprehends the breadth of what digital engineering is truly meant to be. 
It‚Äôs an end-to-end truth source, meaning it‚Äôs not just applied early in a program. It endures throughout a program and only ends when the system is decommissioned.‚Äù‚Äô

We all remember a time when ""Safety"" wasn't on the scoreboard, where people were injured or died everyday, now you are hard pressed to find a company that doesn't have ""Safety"" as one of its key values or even its number 1 priority.
Cybersecurity is the new safety, its only just now coming into focus and it won't be long before it's sitting there along side the other company core values.
As that transition occurs, it is our job to demystify technologies like Vault or Kubernetes and demonstrate how easy these things are to deploy and manage, and more importantly how they can inherently make what companies do today more secure without impacting their bottom line or making things, more complicated.","",""

Today, ReFirm needs you to provide the firmware files, but Microsoft plans to create a database of device information, Weston says.

That said, it would be interesting if they were able to collect anonymized data and use it to build helpful models.  Look at traffic data as an example.

The manufacturing/industrial side is a second/third class citizen in many companies.  IMO, it can be a difficult space to understand for many people since there is not as much direct exposure (many people visit banks, not many people visit factories), especially for those in executive positions (see @Walker Reynolds et al for concerns about companies being run by non-tech MBAs).  However, with the more mainstream companies (AWS, Google and Microsoft) making inroads I wonder if we'll see more focus on the area.  I think there's also been a big push about trying to change the perspective of manufacturing/industry from a dirty repetitive job to a high-tech, challenging career (which many of us in the industry have known for a while).  ISA has been one that has been doing this, but they're not alone, changing the branding has been seen by many as the way to attract the next generation into the workforce.","","üëçüèº (2),üëç (1)"

A robust IoT cloud platform is far more than just a broker.  And even if MQTT is the transport, layered SDKs that provide access to higher level services through that transport can be immensely helpful and valuable.   Heck, Cirrus Link's own MQTT libraries/modules for Ignition have layered SDKs for stuff like file transfers.

Simple stuff like the way the Azure IoT SDK makes device methods work is MASSIVELY valuable and goes beyond what you can do with SpB and an MQTT broker.

Layer on that a variety of device provisioning and onboarding capabilities that some of these SDKs and their corresponding platforms provide, and they can make it a WHOLE lot easier to connect and manage large numbers of devices vs a raw MQTT broker.

And I like cloud IoT platforms that also offer a REST API so that devices that don't want to open persistent connections can be easily implemented.

TL;DR : the world of IoT is more than what an MQTT broker providers.

There will be a License fee for the ctrlX OS. 
It will be a life time license per device. 
The pricing is volume based. 

We are focussing on OEMs with a high volume demand because the integration of ctrlX OS will require some support.

The standard license model for the Apps will apply as for the rest of the HW in the ctrlX ecosystem via the App Store:-

This....This is the controls platform that I have been dreaming of. 
Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm just now discovering it and we aren't discussing ctrlX more.

It's open, extensible, secure, mostly web based, remotely managed, has API for nearly everything that you can do in the web interface. All of which are contrary to most current controls systems, and in alignment for our digital future.

It combines the freedom of programming languages, and many of the latest software features with realtime control.

And allowing a common ""Data Layer"" for all platform applications to access it's very own UNS!!!

With our younger generation focused on more modern technologies, capabilities and programming languages, I believe this approach can help draw more interest from this demographic. They will be able to solve more problems using technologies that meet their more modern expectations.

Considering the future of controls, with the only factor being technology, and if ctrlX delivers on what it promises....I don't know why I would choose any other platform for my machines.","","üíØ (3)"

61511 is for Process and gives SIL levels too, but normally used for a safety Instrumented system
62061 then for Machines gives a SIL too, but again for the SIS 

but a system that conforms to SIL3 62061 does not necessarily confirm to 61644 SIL3 or 61850 SIL 4

But I would not see how any of them would allow a SIL rated SIS uses a standard Operations system as part of the safety chain, and certainly not a cloud based one. 
you can probably make the calculation work based on MTTF etc. But I don't think you would pass all the other requirement clauses.

1) The IoT market has matured, and the hype cycle is over. That is actually a good thing.
2) Cloud providers' layoffs in the IoT domain prove that there is no one-size-fits-all IoT solution. That is also a good thing. Fired IoT professionals will design and build specialized offerings solving particular needs. Public cloud providers offer generic IoT capabilities, far from working out-of-the-box solutions.
3) IoT + IA = huge potential that still requires much work to provide tangible outcomes. From my perspective, IoT + IA is still in the hype phase. It will eventually mature, but we are not there yet.

I would hope it extends to extends to Harmonised Safety Standards in a short period of time
Harmonised EE standards, give a ""presumption of conformity"" under the Law, so If I make a machine and follow the relevant standard, it gives a lot of legal practice, basically in the case of a lawsuit, the complainant would have to prove why my machine was unsafe.
If I follow my own standards( which I am allowed to do mostly) I have to prove my my machine was safe.

Founding (2003‚Äì2004)

The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[10][11] They served as CEO and CFO, respectively.[12] Eberhard said that he wanted to build ""a car manufacturer that is also a technology company"", with its core technologies as ""the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor"".[13]

Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[10] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[14][15][12] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[16]","",""

Automation that helps me and my family survive and thrive is good.
Automation that hurts me and my family is bad.

I think that is 100% Understandable,

Most of us here understand that if you put inputs into a system you can normally predict the outputs.
For a lot of people working in those ports, Automation will make them poorer.

If it increases economic activity as a whole, and all the money goes to the business owners, which can often be the case we are heading for Revolution. 
If automation of the ports increase manufacturing jobs, so the total jobs increases, are we asking the longshoremen to sacrifice their family for the greater good? Are we willing to do the same. And if we are, how do we reward that service?

 The ports are just the early skirmishes, more and more industries are facing this. AI is threatening the professional industries, If I did not have Chat GPT, I would have had to hire someone. Surely Consultants especially the big non domain expert type are on the chopping block.

 But to put it in context, there are about 150k longshore men.

 Imagine self driving technology comes in that put about 4.5 million jobs in the US at risk.  and about 2.5 of those are reasonable good middle class jobs that support a family. And a lot of those will not be able to find replacement jobs, certainly not at a similar income, so you now have a few million angry mostly men in the US. 

If we Automate, and assume that automation will help the economy, and helping the economy will help society, we may leave behind massive sections of people .

That way may lead to , heads, spikes, walls.","","üíØ (4)"

If it's nothing more than a ""protocal converter"", then I don't need to stay completey up-to-date (unless it's a security issue).  If the driver I needed hasn't changed, then I don't care that you've added 27 more drivers.  Or that you've tweaked something in the UI.    So let me pay once, and be done.  Maybe a yearly 10% maintenance fee if I want some more support (but I'd argue, what do I need that for).

For that matter, maybe a pricing model where you get the ""base"" free.  And then you pay for the drivers you need.","","üëç (1)"

Some of our customers have found a creative solution: they purchase a site license for Industrial DataOps, which grants them unlimited installations at that site. This allows them to deploy ‚Äúprotocol converter‚Äù instances (e.g., BACnet to OPC UA or Fanuc to OPC UA) as an added benefit at no additional cost.

I paid 2500 for a Kepware licence to convert 20 tags from modbus to OPC.

Customer didn't want node red.

I've paid 1200 for a hardware OCPP to modbus converter

In one project , I am paying for the standardization brought by Kepware ( NIS compliant customer)

The other I am paying to save the time I would take to program 


So a one time unlimited tag to unlimited protocols. I have been in situations I'd pay 20k for that. Maybe even more 

But for cases of 100 tags to 2 protocols. Id say 1500 would be the limit.

1 protocol or 10 tags and I'm using node red or aomething

So I would imagine that a perpetual licence would need some limits be it protocols or languages or connections.

Both sides have financial incentives, Synadia wants to capitalize on the opp, and CNCF wants to keep NATS under their umbrella because they get hefty dues from their members. 

Synadia's CEO Derek Collison was on CNCF's Board of Directors directly before NATS was accepted by CNCF. It looks to me that Synadia wanted to use CNCF's reach to grow NATS adoption, and they probably feel like they can get more money if they take it themselves.
