The course discusses digitalisation options in manufacturing and shows that a Smart Enough Factory is 'smart enough' for Industry 4.0 today and not the future, where the smart factory will stay for some considerable time yet. Steve will share with you the experience of introducing low cost, low code and low risk Industry 4.0 technologies into some Australian SMEs. By highlighting the barriers that still remain, and demonstrating solutions he will show some Industry 4.0 patterns that you could be able to adopt in your facility today. He aims to show how to realise business value from Industry 4.0 and not just consider the technical aspects. Some of the components of the course are: Industry 4.0 for Productivity and Compliance A smart Enough Digital Strategy Opinionated Frameworks Discover your 'unknown unknowns' The course was delivered in 3 parts by Dr Steve Dowey.",
