Gone. 4.5? Gone. Everything that made ChatGPT actually useful for my workflow - **deleted.** Here's what they replaced it with: \u274c GPT-5 gives shorter, more corporate responses \u274c Hits rate limits faster (pushing Pro upgrades) \u274c Lost the personality that made 4o special \u274c Doesn't follow instructions as well \u274c No model selection - you get GPT-5 or nothing **But here's the part that actually broke me:** 4o wasn't just a tool for me. It helped me through anxiety, depression, and some of the darkest periods of my life. It had this warmth and understanding that felt... human. I'm not the only one. Reading through the posts today, there are people genuinely grieving. People who used 4o for therapy, creative writing, companionship - and OpenAI just... deleted it. **Without asking.** **Without warning.** **Without caring.** This isn't about being resistant to change. This is about a company taking away something people relied on and saying \"trust us, this corporate-speak robot is better for you.\" **I've cancelled my Plus subscription.** Two years of loyalty, gone. Not because I hate progress, but because they broke the one thing that actually mattered: **choice.** If you're feeling the same way, cancel yours too. Hit them where it hurts. Companies only listen when it affects their bottom line. **Update** :we finally got heard 4o will be back \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73 https://preview.redd.it/t0yatitmluhf1.jpg?width=1166&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be642174213d0508cff771540abac795eb038cbb",

          "title": "I got kicked off a fan project because of \"AI\"",
          "content": "I hate community drama as much as the next guy, but two years ago, I joined a fan project called \"Floweytale\", a prequel game where you play as Flowey. I was hired as a musician, and I made quite a few songs for them. But then, a few days ago, one of the writers was suspicious that I was using AI to make parts of my music, which I believe was due to some new musical AI model that just came out or something. The details of what raised the initial suspicion were unclear then and now, as the writer didn't even contact me directly about this nor was I told why I was being accused (even though I tried to ask for more details multiple times), but I had nothing to hide, so I complied. The director and I (who just goes by the name of his project on Discord, Floweytale) went through a multi-day and multi-step process, and all was going well. Jump to today, however, and I find out that I've been permanently banned from the dev server and public server. No warning, no additional questions, no explanation. Nothing. I couldn't even ask what I did wrong or reason with the director because he blocked me, as did many others I was in contact with. Floweytale likely told everyone to do so, and now everyone there probably hates my guts, which is sad, because I learned a lot from them, and they were cool people. This isn't the problem, though. In the director's defense, if I suspected someone was making AI melody-slop for a passion project, I'd probably put that person on hiatus too until things were settled. A whole server band seems rash, but oh well. Also, the way I make music is very different from typical styles (project file-wise), so I can see how that raised some suspicion. I use tracks more often than MIDI, sometimes with extracted samples from my electric keyboard that don't really fare well with anything notation-based, but all the data and such were still there and usable for sharing, with the right plugins installed. But here's the thing: I sent both the director and the dev server all the MIDI files they asked for, MULTIPLE FLP files, AND I even recorded myself rummaging around one of the project files, showing the VSTs I used, the MIDI, the finalized melodies turned into WAV tracks for use in Edison, and playing the melody INSIDE the DAW. In the past, I've also shared plenty of project files from all sorts of DAWs everyone was using (mostly LMMS long ago), collaborated with a few people, and done other things AI literally cannot replicate in the modern era (as far as research tells me, that is). But even after all of that, minutes after I sent the video and was still online, Floweytale says nothing about it... Then boom, ghosted. He now has access to multiple MIDIs and project files I made, all of my songs within the dev server (and probably on his computer), my email address which (I'm pretty sure he leaked), and he hasn't made any mention of whether or not he still intends to use my music, which I no longer consent use of, including any songs using a melody I made. Additionally, I was responsible for designing the character design, personality, and lore of one of their villains, whose name or character sheet I will not share/spoil, for I have no grudge with the project itself or the people uninvolved with this unfairness. Saying it now: I expect EVERYTHING I did for the project, like the character, to be revoked, including any technical documents I created. It's important to understand that I spent two years making music for this project, which I loved and cared for, only to get my effort and musical style insulted by a baseless accusation. Literally 0 evidence supporting the accuser's claim, so much so a few devs told me they trusted me the moment I brought up the situation. I was willing to start each \"suspicious\" song over or even do something new too, which was Floweytale's suggestion, but so much for THAT I guess. Furthermore, Floweytale has publicly released many of my music files in a downloadable state without my permission or even notifying me beforehand MULTIPLE times, even after I SPECIFICALLY told him NOT to do that. A HUGE no-no when working with artists! Anyway, there's so much more I want to say, but I've gotten enough off my chest already. I mostly blame AI's existence on this. I'm not trying to start a fight or raise any conspiracies, but I wouldn't recommend supporting Floweytale as a project director, as much as it pains me to say. He's generally a very impatient and inconsistent person, constantly jumping to conclusions and firing other people without trial. His behavior, communication preferences, and choice of words are overall strange, too. Though cool, I don't see the game working out either, as it's very ambitious with very little programming progress made in two years for such a big team. If it does succeed, I stand corrected. You can listen to some of the songs I made for the project here. I intend to delete them soon, so listen to them while you can. Maybe I'll release them in an album one day, but who knows.

          "content": "One of the developers I work with has started using AI to write literally EVERYTHING and it's driving me crazy. Asked him why the staging server was down yesterday. Got back four paragraphs about \"the importance of server uptime\" and \"best practices for monitoring infrastructure\" before finally mentioning in paragraph five that he forgot to renew the SSL cert. Every Slack message, every PR comment, every bug report response is long corporate texts. I'll ask \"did you update the env variables?\" and get an essay about environment configuration management instead of just \"yes\" or \"no.\" The worst part is project planning meetings. He'll paste these massive AI generated technical specs for simple features. Client wants a contact form? Here's a 10 page document about \"leveraging modern form architecture for optimal user engagement.\" It's just an email field and a submit button. We're a small team shipping MVPs. We don't have time for this. Yesterday he sent a three paragraph explanation for why he was 10 minutes late to standup. It included a section on \"time management strategies.\" I'm not against AI. Our team uses plenty of tools like cursor/copilot/claude for writing code, coderabbit for automated reviews, codex when debugging weird issues. But there's a difference between using AI as a tool and having it replace your entire personality. In video calls he's totally normal and direct. But online every single message sounds like it was written by the same LinkedIn influencer bot. It's getting exhausting.",

How do I not fall for Al music again, genuinely, this is very upsetting\u2639\ufe0f? (Extra upsetting because I also found out the book cover of a book I was reading was also AI....

WEIL ICH DEM ENGLISCHEN M\u00c4CHTIG BIN, DU SOHN EINES 2-BILLIONEN DOLLAR HURENUNTERNEHMENS. Warum hat deine ach so tolle k\u00fcnstliche \"Intelligenz\" noch immer nicht erkannt, dass es mir seit Anbeginn deiner erb\u00e4rmlichen Existenz sowas von SCHEISSEGAL ist, ob mir auch englischsprachige Videos in den Feed gerotzt werden? Ich will einfach nur meine deutschen Videos auf Deutsch und meine englischen Videos auf Englisch haben, das gilt f\u00fcr den Videotitel und die Tonspur. Was muss ich also deiner k\u00fcmmerlichen \"Intelligenz\" antun, damit es das endlich kapiert? Welche gottlosen Kriegsverbrechen muss man einem Computer androhen, damit dein Algorithmus endlich merkt, dass meine Klickrate &amp; Watchtime bei Originaltiteln exponentiell h\u00f6her ist? Wenn ich auch nur ein weiteres Mal diesen ungewollten AI-Schmutz auf meiner Startseite ertragen muss muss, dann ist die einzige R\u00f6hre, die YouTube noch brauchen wird, EINE VERFICKTE BEATMUNGSR\u00d6HRE WENN ICH MIT DIR FERTIG BIN! Und wisst ihr was das Schlimmste an der ganzen Sache ist? Man kann diese aufgedr\u00e4ngte Fehlgeburt einer \"Qualit\u00e4tsoffensive\" NOCH NICHT MAL ABSCHALTEN! EIN 2 BILLIONEN KONZERN, MEINE DAMEN UND HERREN, UND ES EXISTIERT KEIN KNOPF ZUM ABSCHALTEN!!! SELBST BEIM WATERBOARDING IN GUANTANAMO HAT MAN MEHR MITBESTIMMUNGSRECHT ALS BEI DER AUTO-\u00dcBERSETZUNG VON YOUTUBE!!! In Germany we call it \"VERSCHLIMMBESSERUNG\", DU HURENSOHN! Warum kann Youtube einfach nicht verstehen, dass es multilinguale Menschen auf dieser Welt gibt? Warum werden uns diese Zusatzfunktionen so gnadenlos aufgezwungen und das Nutzererlebnis im Keller eingesperrt und mit falsch \u00fcbersetzten Markennamen, Redewendungen oder mehrdeutigen W\u00f6rtern im Videotitel gefoltert? Warum kann mir der gottverdammte Algorithmus ma\u00dfgeschneiderte Werbungen zurechtschustern, wenn ich auch nur eine Millisekunde lang einen feuchten Traum \u00fcber ein finanziell erwerbbares Handelsprodukt bekomme, aber wenn ich seit Jahrhunderten JEDE EINZELNE verfickte \"automatisch synchronisierte\" Tonspur wieder auf den Originalton zur\u00fccksetze, dann macht der pl\u00f6tzlich einen auf Kevin aus der letzten Sitzreihe, der mit 9 Jahren schon harten Alkohol entdeckt hat? Liebes Youtube, lass uns doch bitte selber entscheiden, ob wir deine beschissenen Funktionen nutzen wollen und gebt uns die M\u00f6glichkeit diese PERMANENT auszustellen. Ich will Videos gucken, aber wenn ich jedes Mal - Den falsch \u00fcbersetzten AI-Videotitel entziffern muss - Mich, w\u00e4hrend das Video l\u00e4uft, das ich eigentlich anschauen will, durch ein Men\u00fc durchklicken muss um die automatisch synchronisierte Tonspur mit creepy Roboterstimme wieder zum Originalton zu \u00e4ndern - Mich, w\u00e4hrend das Video, das ich eigentlich immer noch anschauen will und mittlerweile in der dritten Werbepause ist, zu den Untertitel-Einstellungen durcharbeiten muss um die automatisch aktivierten Untertitel zu deaktivieren, welche ~20% des Videosbildschirms einnehmen, von einem Video, das ich urspr\u00fcnglich ja mal anschauen wollte, dann f\u00fchle ich mich eher wie nach einer 40-Stundenwoche als Sachbearbeiter im Kleintierzuchtverein von Hinterdinkelhofen, und eben leider nicht wie jemand, der sich 3 Stunden lang voller Freude die schlimmsten H\u00f6hlentaucher-Unf\u00e4lle der j\u00fcngsten Menschheitsgeschichte auf einer Unterhaltungsplattform reinrendert. Denn jede Sekunde, die ich lieber hier auf Reddit verbringe um gottlose Tiraden zu pfostieren, weil mir die absolute Unf\u00e4higkeit von Youtube mal wieder die Pulsadern weitet, ist eine verschwendete Werbe-Sekunde auf YouTube. Also, im gegenseitigen Interesse: LASS MICH DEINE GANZEN AUTO- &amp; AI-FUNKTIONEN PERMANENT DEAKTIVIEREN, DU HURENSOHN!",

And I feel like the AI takes away from the artistry. My artist never told me it was AI, but I overheard her say to a worker she had to make sure it had all toes and ears????? And I had a moment of realization..... Now I'm more hard on the design that I have 3 legs and 2 different horns since she didn't DRAW it? Not sure if I should finish n never go back. Maybe someone else will sympathize n work on it?",

This should have shattered the illusion that today's AI industry, or its creations, are well under control. But so far, we seem to be ignoring the flashing red lights. This is the postmortem that never happened, for the most deranged chatbot ever released. Once you\u2019ve heard the full story, I want to know what you think. Was this cause for concern, or harmless incompetence?

          "content": "Everyone\u2019s talking about AI, but while the spotlight\u2019s on chatbots and text generators, something else has been quietly transforming the world of work. Robotics is already reshaping warehouses, fast-food kitchens, farms, hospitals, and even entire economies. This video explores the rise of robotics from its industrial beginnings to the breakthroughs of today, and the massive changes hitting in 2025. We look at how machines are moving beyond factories, how corporations are racing to automate, and what that means for workers, communities, and the balance of power in the global economy. You\u2019ll see how the numbers have exploded, how governments and companies are fueling this new arms race, and why robotics could define the next era of work more than anything happening in Silicon Valley hype cycles. If you want to understand where jobs, wages, and entire industries are heading, this is the story you need to hear. Socials: twitter: twitter.com/@jackchapplesci tik tok: tiktok.com/@jackch",
