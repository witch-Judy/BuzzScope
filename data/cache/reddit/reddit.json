This was not the case at first when I started this but at this point it’ll be funny if it was anyone at all. I am looking forward to seeing all of your suggestions and also seeing what wins in the end. As a reminder, we are not coming up with entirely new moves from scratch. Unfortunately I am not goated with the sauce enough to keep up with that so we’ll be stealing from existing character kits instead.",

      "content": "After the Charlie Kirk’s death, social media is about to have a field day. And seeing people cheer and say about how advocates for the use of guns is ironic is actually seriously depressing. This world isn’t fit for the debaters who speak in kind tones, not for the ones who act respectful to others, not for the people who can sit down and have a conversation. Whether you believe in God or not, his death is a disgusting representation of the modern day world. His heart was with God and now his soul enters the gates. RIP Charlie Kirk, I pray for the next life and hold hands with our Father above. Remember this verse, all backgrounds of the Christian faith can all agree on this from now on. \"If the world hates you, understand that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you!” (John 15: 18-19) I’d you support this vile behavior, I hope that one day you find God and that goes to all people who don’t belong to God already. Tbh, I didn’t always agree. But people trying to find justice amongst this act of hate just disgusts me.",

I feel like I have passed my Cat-reddit exam! She is already super cuddly and loves to nap; it’s clear we were destined to be together.

As a bonus, you guys get the incredibly cursed second place winnings (Yes that is Aloofly Honest for A4). I also want to shoutout u/WhoAreYouAn, who has started a version of this but creating the WORST HSR Character, and u/Eternal_33550336, who is also doing something similar but with the no dupes rule, so go check them out after this! Finally, I will be starting a new run of this again where I learn from my mistakes, which you can check out on my profile right now (unless you’re here early). And yes the copy-pasted message will still be here don’t worry. As a reminder, we are not coming up with entirely new moves from scratch. Unfortunately I am not goated with the sauce enough to keep up with that so we’ll be stealing from existing character kits instead.",

      "title": "Found My Man in Reddit gc!",
      "content": "We met earlier this year in a Reddit group chat. At the time, I was battling a depressive disorder, and he had this habit of tagging people in the group, asking if they needed help or felt like talking. It wasn’t just me,he did this for everyone, whether they were a man or a woman. At first, I ignored him. I was tired of cribbing about my misery.one day I noticee him extend the same kindness to another group member. That’s when I texted a mutual friend, saying, “This guy is so kind and amazing.” She told me he was an incredible listener and I should give a try talking to him. I messaged him without any expectations, and honestly, I was blown away. That night, we ended up talking for hours. I was going through a lot, and he was just... there. Listening. He wasn’t trying to “fix” me or change the subject,he just let me talk. And the way he listened was something else.. I later got to know that he does that with everyone,he just has this way of making people feel heard. Yes, he was an amazing listener, but he was so much more than that. He was kind, funny, handsome, and somehow always knew how to make me feel special. He’s the kind of person who brings warmth into every interaction, and the more I got to know him, the more attached I became. I remember feeling anxious at times because I’d get this strong intuition that he wasn’t okay that something was bothering him. And every single time, my gut feeling was right. It’s hard to explain, but knowing he wasn’t feeling his best would affect me deeply, and I’d just want to do everything I could to make him feel better. At first, we flirted a lot, mostly for fun. Neither of us meant anything serious by it. But over time, those lconversations turned into something deeper. Without even realizing it, we fell for each other. The funny part was neither of us wanted to be in a relationship. We were firm about just “going with the flow.” But for me, that didn’t last long. I couldn’t help it,I realized he was the one. He wasn’t just someone I liked talking to; he was the man I had been craving. He was the one! He was more than everything I was looking for. When I told him how I felt how I wanted him as my partner, he hesitated. He wasn’t sure if a relationship was the right step. I asked him why, and we had this long, heartfelt conversation over the video call. By the end of it, he said something that still gives me butterflies: “Sleep like my girlfriend today.” That moment... I am smiling while typing it For many months,we were in the long-distance thing . I was stuck at home with my conservative family, and later I moved to a very restricted university. Getting a gate pass from that university was pain in ass, but after hell lot lies and risks, I finally got the gate pass. . And that 12 hour journey felt like forever, but every minute was filled with excitement and anticipation.I remember I had shared my location with him, and he was counting kilometers between us. When I saw him for the first time, everything just... stopped. His hug, his scent, That brown colour tshirt of his is still my fav (hope I get chance to steal it someday), the way his eyes softened when he looked at me ,I'll never forget it. The first words out of his mouth? “Kitni sundar ho tum” . I still can’t think about that moment without blushing. And then, the next few days were the best days of my life,he spoiled me in the cheesiest, most adorable ways. He tied my shoelaces, painted my nails,, bought me dresses, and cooked food for mem, massaged my feet and what not! This man is just PERFECT. He made me feel like the most loved and cared for person in the world. The night before I had to go back to university, we cuddled, and then, out of nowhere, he started crying like a little baby, holding me tight. It broke my heart and healed it all at once. He cooked and packed fried rice for me for travelling, while my bus was leaving. He refused to do eye contact, he was trying to hold his tears and still he wasn't able to We started as two people who found it hard to form attachments, people who never thought we’d feel this way about anyone. And yet, here we are,so in love that it still doesn’t feel real sometimes. I don’t know how it happened, but I’m so grateful it did.I have hit the jackpot! TL;DR: Met a kind amazing guy on Reddit during a tough time. We talked, connected deeply, and fell in love, even though neither of us planned to. After a long-distance wait, we met, and he made me feel like the most loved person in the world. I hit the jackpot!",

      "content": "...it feels like some POE veterans don't realize anymore how lucky they are with the dev team they have. Seriously, the reaction and the passion from them is amazing. The generosity in content, in POE1 and 2. The interviews. The quick patch notes adressing a lot of things brought up my the community. And on this reddit, they get constantly flamed, it's crazy. Some comments and posts I see are borderline hateful towards them. Of course they have some visions they have to defend, because as a dev, you can't just blindly take all the feedbacks from the players and put it in your game. You have to be careful. Especially feedbacks from people with 10k+ hours, i mean those players are a SUPER IMPORTANT part of the community but they also have very specific and weird needs that new players just don't understand haha. Again, sorry if you're not a big fan of POE2, that sucks. And it sucks that POE1 is not taken care as much this year. But for real. We are blessed with the people who are taking care of this game. Personnaly i'm having a blast on POE2 eventhough there's still some work to do and some things to adjust. Peace and stay sane Exiles!!",

And they brought up the same three reasons it was absurd that I survived. One of them was a very, very near miss from something important, a one in a million kind of situation, and a third third was basically a miracle. The age, the wounds, the specifics were all a match.

      "content": "I'm tinkering with an application of human pose estimation which [fails miserably](https://i.imgur.com/S0kVyPg.mp4) using off-the-shelf models/tools, as the domain is especially niche and complex compared to their training distribution. It seems there's no way around fine-tuning on in-domain images with manually-labeled keypoints (thankfully, I have thousands of hours of unlabelled footage to start from). I've always been intrigued by active learning, so I'm looking forward to applying it here to efficiently sample frames for manual labeling. But I've never witnessed it in industry, and have only ever encountered [pessimistic takes on active learning in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13elpm1/d_is_active_learning_a_hoax_or_the_future/) (not the concept ofc, but the degree to which it outperforms random sampling). As an extra layer of complexity - it seems like a manual labeler (likely myself) would have to enter labels through a browser GUI. Ideally, the labeler should produce labels concurrently as the model trains on its labels-thus-far and considers unlabeled frames to send to the labeler. Suddenly my training pipeline gets complicated! My current plan: * Sample training frames for labeling according to variance in predictions between adjacent frames, or perhaps dropout uncertainty. Higher uncertainty should --&gt; worse predictions * For the holdout val+test sets (split by video), sample frames truly at random * In the labeling GUI, display the model's initial prediction, and just drag the skeleton around * Don't bother with concurrent labeling+training, way too much work. I care more about hours spent labeling than calendar time at this point. I'd love to know whether it's worth all the fuss. I'm curious to hear about any cases where active learning succeeded or flopped in an industry/applied setting. * In practice, when does active learning give a clear win over random? When will it probably be murkier? * Recommended batch sizes/cadence and stopping criteria? * Common pitfalls (uncertainty miscalibration, sampling bias, annotator fatigue)?",

      "content": "Hello Reddit, I'm a PhD physicist with an academic background in computational methods and couple years of experience applying them in a commercial R&amp;D setting. My current work focuses on using Flow Matching and Diffusion Models for physics simulations, which is a fascinating area itself. The challenge I'm facing is that my current role is heavily focused on code development and deploying of existing models, with little opportunity for original, in-depth research. I have a number of research ideas related to GenAI Diffusion/Flow-based models across different modalities, but my company's priorities are focused on rapid deployment, not fundamental research. I'm looking to transition into a more research-oriented role where I can experiment, study, and pursue these and some else's ideas. I'm open to both academic and industrial opportunities. My question to the community is: * What grants, universities, or research institutions could I pursuit? * Do you know of any specific labs, orgs or companies known for their work on Flow Matching/Diffusion models for scientific or physical applications with a research agenda? * For those who have made a similar transition from (say industry) to a more research-focused industry role, what advice do you have? Are there specific resources or networks I should tap into? Any advice or leads would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

      "content": "Hello Reddit, This guide I made shows how to take a photo with an Arducam Mini Module (OV2640, 2MP) on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W using CircuitPython, and save the JPEG directly to the board’s filesystem (/images). It’s a minimal, reliable starting point for camera projects, data collection, or low-power IoT devices that snap and stash pictures locally. This is a cool way to make some awesome IoT projects with Python! You can take it a step further you like and send images to the cloud, or do some other analysis on the device itself.

I learned about LEDs, OLED screen, pushbutton, and somewhat about esp32 pins. Today i am learning about dht22 sensor. But, iot is too vast, what should i focus on first? Any theories, laws etc. or should i learn about sensors first? I made a traffic light mini project with three LEDs, a OLED screen and a button. I am currently just studying from datasheets and chatgpt, are there any youtube channels, blogs, communities dedicated to IoT like this sub reddit? Any help is much appreciated.",

      "content": "**e: I lied. This remains unsolved. It was briefly working today and now has mysteriously stopped working.** Hey everyone - apologies in advance if the answer is obvious, I've been combing reddit and online and haven't been able to find a solution that fixes my problem so hoping I might be able to probe the brains on here for a solution! Working with a DFPlayer Mini for a project (Droid build) and I'm very novice when it comes to arduino, but am having a ton of fun learning! Right now I can get my board (ELEGOO Uno R3) to recognize and connect to the DFPlayer, but when the code fires up, the speaker pops twice and then never plays any sound (even when serial says it's playing track 1). The code I am using is below (I found it on the Arduino forum while troubleshooting and tweaked it slightly) #include \"SoftwareSerial.h\" #include \"DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h\" // Use pins 10 and 11 to communicate with DFPlayer Mini static const uint8_t PIN_MP3_TX = 10; // D7 static const uint8_t PIN_MP3_RX = 11; // D6 SoftwareSerial softwareSerial(PIN_MP3_RX, PIN_MP3_TX); // Create the Player object DFRobotDFPlayerMini player; void setup() { softwareSerial.begin(9600); Serial.begin(9600); Serial.println(); Serial.println(F(\"DFRobot DFPlayer Mini Demo\")); Serial.println(F(\"Initializing DFPlayer ... (May take 3~5 seconds)\")); if (!player.begin(softwareSerial)) { //Use softwareSerial to communicate with mp3. Serial.println(F(\"Unable to begin:\")); Serial.println(F(\"1.Please recheck the connection!\")); Serial.println(F(\"2.Please insert the SD card!\")); while(true){ delay(0); // Code to compatible with ESP8266 watch dog. } } Serial.println(F(\"DFPlayer Mini online.\")); player.volume(30); //Set volume value. From 0 to 30 Serial.println(F(\"volume = 30\")); } void loop() { player.play(1); //Play the first mp3 Serial.println(F(\"play track 1\")); delay(5000); } I apologize for not knowing how to make good looking circuit diagrams like so many people here, but this is my power/wiring set up description. It's worth noting that the full project involves some RGB LEDs and two servos - the Buck is set to 5.5V because I was occasionally seeing resets when servos spiked. 2 18650 Batteries -&gt; Protection Board -&gt; Buck (set to output 5.5V) The DFPlayerMini receives power directly from the buck, and the Arduino is also powered from the buck. All grounds tied together. There's a 1K resistor between the DFPlayer's RX terminal and the Arduino. I have BOTH grounds on the DFPlayer tying back to the common ground. SPK\\_1 going to positive on the speaker, SPK\\_2 going to negative. 4Ω, 3W speaker. No amp. For the SD Card - I have tried both having 0001.mp3 in the root folder, and having 0001.mp3 in a /mp3 folder on the card. Neither has worked for playback as of yet. ANY help anyone can provide would be so, so appreciated. It's been a ton of fun learning Arduino (and so many posts on this subreddit have taught me SO much already!)",
