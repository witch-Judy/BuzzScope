      "content": "I might be completely wrong, but I think Cursor is not the way forward (unless they expand upon it) I have read Claude Code docs, and I am surprised how many utilities it comes with, that are sorely missing in Cursor. That alone makes Claude Code automatically more useful Number one is that it can be fully controlled with CLI, that means that as a dev you can pretty much do whatever you want you can write a bash script that uses the CLI to create a multistep workflow, e.g.: 1) read issue from github, 2) find what files are relevant to the issue, 3) create a step by step plan to tackle the issue, 4) use a loop to work on the plan step by step, with custom instructions, e.g. apply linters after every step, run all tests and they must pass, etc, 5) create and write a PR how do you do this in Cursor? answer: you can't You can't because they started building the house by the roof. Create a CLI utility that is programable, then you are welcome to create a IDE on top that uses the CLI and makes some tasks easier this is my opinion, I welcome opposite opinions, but we either go the path of total automation or we don't",

The more I work with it, the more I realize how limiting Cursor is. Claude Code wipes the floor with Cursor in terms of speed and quality. Other tools give similar in IDE behavior, but directly in VSCode, and at a lower price. I have a feeling Cursor was the leader last year, people adopted it and now have no interest in learning something new. I get it, lock-in is real, why learn new tools if what you have \"works\". The problem is the AI world is changing fast. Has anyone re-evaluated Cursor vs the other options? What was your conclusion?",

      "content": "I’ve been burned by Cursor and learned my lesson. Cursor typically charges about **20% extra commission** on top of the model’s token usage, and it’s not even transparent about how many tokens you’ve actually used. You can get the **exact same models** on free VS Code extensions like **KiloCode, Cline, or RooCode** — using your model providers' API key or OpenRouter — with a **clear, per-token pricing** scheme and avoid the shady “Cursor tax.” For me, the **only selling point left for Cursor** is the autocomplete feature, which is free. But even that can be done in VS Code with **Copilot** or open-source extensions like **Continue**. So I’m curious — why one still should use Cursor?",

      "content": "I spent the whole day deep-diving into Codex, and I'm seriously impressed. It genuinely feels like there’s a senior engineer behind the model. It gives you the sense that it's actually reading and understanding your code, not just running a glorified \\`grep\\` to find keywords and summarize them. For instance, when I asked it to map out a plan for a new feature, it pointed to specific logic within a specific file, explained its purpose, and then laid out Options A, B, and C. It even added priorities, telling me which part to build first and which was optional. When it comes to pure programming, my gut feeling right now is that Codex \"gets\" coding the most. This experience helped me form an initial mental model for these tools: **1. For Hardcore Programming:** \\- Codex is absolutely professional-grade. The strategies it suggests are built on a solid architectural mindset. \\- Cursor, by comparison, is more general-purpose. It's incredibly flexible if you know its tricks, and it's definitely more beginner-friendly. **2. For Tooling and Broader Workflows:** \\- Claude Code's main strength is its powerful Agent and toolchain ecosystem. The potential here is massive; its entire philosophy seems to be \"enhancing AI programming through tools.\" \\- Cursor also provides convenient plugins, but it relies more on the user to extend its capabilities. **Core Conclusion** This leads me to a fundamental distinction in their approach: \\- Codex feels like: (Core Coding Model) + Agent. It starts with an extremely deep understanding of code, and then uses an Agent to execute tasks based on that understanding. \\- Claude Code feels like: (Core Agent) + Coding Ability. Its foundation is the Agent, which accomplishes tasks by calling on a variety of tools, one of which happens to be programming. **TL;DR Recommendation** \\- If you're after the purest, most hardcore coding experience, Codex seems to be the most powerful all-around choice right now. \\- If your workflow extends beyond just coding and you need powerful tool integration, Claude Code is your best bet. \\- Cursor sits nicely in the middle. It has the widest coverage and is probably the best entry point for most people.",

Claude Code feels great for speed — spin up a CLI, describe what you want, and boom: full functions, file stubs, even basic PRs. but it tends to drift fast if your codebase has tight conventions or edge cases. Cursor’s slower but way better for clean edits, refactors, and staying aligned with existing patterns. the IDE context awareness helps a lot when juggling big codebases. we wrote up a breakdown if anyone’s comparing [workflows](https://www.leanware.co/insights/cursor-vs-claude-code-comparison), not a promo, just real-world notes. curious how others are splitting use between the two (if at all)? anyone building hybrid flows?",

      "title": "Why I changed Cursor to Copilot and it turned out to be the best choice",
      "content": "Hello everyone. I'm the creator of [APM](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management) and I have been trying various AI assistant tools the last year. Id say I have a fair amount of experience when it comes to using them effectively and also when it comes to terms like prompt, context engineering etc. Ive been fairly active in the r/cursor subreddit since I discovered Cursor, about November-December 2024. At first I would just post how amazing this tool is and how **I feel like I am robbing them** with how efficient and effective my workflow had become. Nowadays, im not that active here since I switched to VS Code + Copilot but I have been paying attention to how many ppl have been complaining about Cursor's billing changes feel like a scam and what not. Thank God, I managed to predict this back in May when I cancelled my sub since they had the incredibly slow queues and the product was basically unusable... now I dont have to go through **feeling like I am being robbed!** Seriously... thats the vibe ppl in that subreddit have been getting from using the product lately and it shows. All these subtle, sketchy moves on changing the billing, not explaining what \"unlimited\" means (since it wasnt actually unlimited) or what the rate limits were. I remember someone got as far as doing a research to see if they are actually breaking any laws and found two haha. Even if this company had the best product in the world and I would set my self back from not using it, I would still cancel my sub since **I can't stand the feeling of being scammed.** A month ago, the main argument was that: *Cursor has the best product in the world when it comes to AI assistance so they can do whatever they want and most ppl will still stay and continue using it.* However now in my opinion, this isnt even the case. Cursor *had* the best product in the world, but now other labs are catching up and maybe even getting ahead. Here is a list of the top of my head of products that actually match Cursor in performance: * Claude Code (maybe its even better in the Max Option) * VS Code + Roo OR Cline ( and also these are OPEN SOURCE and have GREAT communities and devs behind them) * **VS Code + Copilot (my personal fav + its also OPEN SOURCE)** In general, everybody knows that supporting Open Source products is better, but many times it feels like you are compromising some of the performance you can get just to be Open Source. I'd say that rn this isnt the case. I think that Open Source is catching up and actually now that hosting local LLMs in regular GPUs is starting to become a thing... its probably gonna stay that way until some tech giant decides otherwise. **Why** I **prefer Copilot:** 1. First of all, I have Copilot Pro on a free from Github Education. People are gonna come at me and say that Cursor is free for students too, but it's not. Its free for students that have a .edu email, meaning that its only free for students with from USA, UK, Canada and in general top-player countries. Countries like mine, you have to contact their support only for **Sam the LLM** to say some AI slop and just tell you to buy Pro... 2. Second of all, it operates as Cursor used to: with a standard monthly request limit. On Copilot Pro its 300 premium requests for 10 bucks. Pretty good deal for me, as ive noticed that in Copilot its ACTUALLY around 300 requests and not 150 and the rest are broken tool calls or no-answer requests. 3. Thirdly, it's actually GOOD. Since I mostly use [APM](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management), when doing AI assisted coding, I use multiple chat sessions at once, and I expect from my editor to offer good \"agentic\" behavior from its models. In Copilot, even the base model GPT 4.1 has been surprisingly stable when it comes to behaving as an Agent and not as a chat model. What do you guys think? Does Cursor have such a huge user base that they dont give a flying fuck ab the portion of the Users that will migrate to other products? I think they do, judging from the recent posts in this subreddit where they fish for User feedback and they suddenly start to become transparent ab their billing model...",

      "content": "Cursor team. I didn't want to do this, but many of us have noticed recently that the slow queue is significantly slower all of the sudden and it is unacceptable how you are treating us. On models which are typically fast for the slow queue (like gemini 2.5 pro). I noticed it, and decided to see if I could uncover anything about what was happening. As my username suggests I know a thing or two about hacking, and while I was very careful about what I was doing as to not break TOS of cursor, I decided to reverse engineer the protocols being send and recieved on my computer. I set up Charles proxy and proxifier to force capture and view requests. Pretty basic. Lo and behold, I found a treasure trove of things which cursor is lying to us about. Everything from how large the auto context handling is on models, both max mode and non max mode, to how they pad the numbers on the user viewable token count, to how they are now automatically placing slow requests into a default \"place\" in the queue and it counts down from 120. EVERY TIME. WITHOUT FAIL. I plan on releasing a full report, but for now it is enough to say that cursor is COMPLETELY lying to our faces. I didn't want to come out like this, but come on guys (Cursor team)! I kept this all private because I hoped you could get through the rough patch and get better, but instead you are getting worse. Here are the results of my reverse engineering efforts. Lets keep Cursor accountable guys! If we work together we can keep this a good product! Accountability is the first step! Attached is a link to my code: [https://github.com/Jordan-Jarvis/cursor-grpc](https://github.com/Jordan-Jarvis/cursor-grpc) With this, ANYONE who wants to view the traffic going to and from cursor's systems to your system can. Just use Charles proxy or similar. I had to use proxifier as well to force some of the plugins to respect it as well. You can replicate the screenshots I provided YOURSELF. Results: You will see context windows which are significantly smaller than advertised, limits on rule size, pathetic chat summaries which are 2 paragraphs before chopping off 95% of the context (explaining why it forgets so much randomly). The actual content being sent back and forth (BidiAppend). The Queue position which counts down 1 position every 2 seconds... on the dot... and starts at 119.... every time.... and so much more. Please join me and help make cursor better by keeping them accountable! If it keeps going this way I am confident the company WILL FAIL. People are not stupid. Competition is significantly more transparent, even if they have their flaws. There is a good chance this post will get me banned, please spread the word. We need cursor to KNOW that WE KNOW THEIR LIES! Mods, I have read the rules, I am being civil, providing REAL VERIFIABLE information, so not misinformation, providing context, am NOT paid, etc.. If I am banned, or if this is taken down, it will purely be due to Cursor attempting to cover their behinds. BTW, if it is taken down, I will make sure it shows up in other places. This is something people need to know. Morally, what you are doing is wrong, and people need to know. I WILL edit or take this down if someone from the cursor team can clarify what is really going on. I fully admit I do not understand every complexity of these systems, but it seems pretty clear some shady things are afoot.",

      "title": "Airliner video shows matched noise, text jumps, and cursor drift",
      "content": "**Edit 2022-08-22: These videos are both hoaxes. I wrote about the community led investigation** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufosmeta/comments/15yvspd/airliner_videos_show_rufos_elevates_good_research/)**.** **tl;dr**: [Airliner satellite video](https://web.archive.org/web/20140827052109/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ok1A1fSzxY) right hand side is a warped copy of the left, but not necessarily fake. The cursor is displayed so smoothly it looks like VFX instead of real UI. Around the same time I posted a writeup [analyzing the disparity](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15qrg1e/airliner_video_shows_complex_treatment_of_depth/) in the airliner satellite video pair, u/Randis posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15qr9l0/mh370_airliner_video_is_doctored_proof_included/) pointing out that there are matching noise patterns between the two videos. When I saw the screenshot I thought it just looked like similarly shaped clouds, but after more careful analysis I agree that it is matching ~~sensor~~ noise. The frame that u/Randis posted is frame 593. This happens in the section between frame 587 through 747 where the video is not panning. Below is a crop from the original footage during that section, at position 205,560 and 845,560 in a 100x100 pixel window (approximately where u/Randis drew red boxes), upsampled 8x using nearest neighbor, and contrast dialed up 20x. https://reddit.com/link/15rbuzf/video/qe60npf3e5ib1/player Another way to see this even more clearly is to stack up all the images from this section and take the median over time. This will give us a very clear background image without any noise. Then we can subtract that background image from each frame, and it will leave us with only noise. The video below is the absolute difference between the median background image and the current frame, multiplied by 30 to increase the brightness. https://reddit.com/link/15rbuzf/video/q66wurdff5ib1/player The fact that the noise matches so well indicates that one of the videos is a copy of the other, and it is not a true second perspective. **If this is fake**, this means that a complex depth map was generated that accounts for the overall slant of the ocean, and for the clouds and aircraft appearing in the foreground. The rendering pipeline would be: first 3D or 2D render, then add noise, then apply depth map. It would have been just as easy to apply the noise after the depth map, and for someone who spent so much care on all the other steps it is surprising they would make this mistake. **If this is real,** there is likely no second satellite. But there may be synthetic aperture radar performing [interferometric analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) to estimate the depth. SAR interferometry is like having a Kinect depth sensor in the sky. For the satellite nerds: this means looking for a satellite that was in the right position at the right time, and includes both visible and SAR imaging. Another thread to pull would be looking into SAR + visible visualization devices, and see if we can narrow down what kind of hardware this may have been displayed on. What would the depth image look like? Presumably it would look something like the disparity video that we get from running [StereoSGBM](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/d85/classcv_1_1StereoSGBM.html), but smoother and with fewer artifacts. (**Edit:** I moved the disparity video [here](https://imgur.com/a/yUUIsCQ).) Additionally, u/JunkTheRat identified that the text on the right [slants and jumps](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15r2lsd/comment/jw6dvdh/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) while the text on the left stays still. This is consistent with the image on the right being a distorted version of the image on the left, and not a true secondary camera perspective. Here is a visualization showing this effect across the entire video. * At the top left is the frame number. * The top image is the left image telemetry. * The second image is the right image telemetry. * The third image is the absolute difference between the left and right. * The fourth image is the absolute difference with brightness increased 4x. https://reddit.com/link/15rbuzf/video/dzblv6ivk5ib1/player The text is clearly slanting and jumping. This indicates the telemetry data on the right was not added in post, but it is a distorted version of the video on the left. This led me to another question: what is happening with the cursor? If this is real, I would expect the cursor to be overlaid at a consistent disparity, so it appears \"on top\" of all the other stuff on the screen. If the entire right image, including the cursor, is just a distortion of the one on the left, then I would expect the cursor to jump around just like the text. But as I was looking into this, I found something that is a much bigger \"tell\", in my opinion. Anyone who has set a single keyframe in video editing or VFX software will recognize this immediately, and I'm sort of surprised it hasn't come up yet. **The cursor drifts with subpixel precision during 0:36 - 0:45 (frames 865-1079).** Here is a zoom into that section with the drifting cursor, upsampled with nearest neighbor interpolation and with difference images on the bottom. Note that the window is shifted by 640+3 pixels. https://reddit.com/link/15rbuzf/video/qsv2hgd6y5ib1/player Note that the difference image changes slightly. This indicates that it is being affected by a depth map, just like the text. If we looked through more of the video we might find that it follows the disparity of the regions around it, rather than having a fixed disparity as you would expect from UI overlay. But the big thing to notice is how smoothly the cursor is drifting. I estimate the cursor moves [17px in 214 frames](https://imgur.com/a/o9GM39O), that's 0.08 pixels per frame. While many modern pointing interfaces track user input with subpixel precision, I am unaware of any UI that displays cursors with subpixel precision. Even if we assume this screen recording is downsampled from a very large 8K screen, and we multiply the distance by 10x, that's still 0.8 pixels per frame. Of course a mouse can move this slowly (like when it is broken, or slowly falling off a desk) but the cursor UI cannot move this smoothly. Try and move your cursor very slowly and you will see it jumps from one pixel to the next. I don't know any UI that lets you use a cursor less than 1px. Here is a side-by-side video showing what a normal cursor looks like (on the right) and what a VFX animation looks like (on the left). https://reddit.com/link/15rbuzf/video/9gqiujopt7ib1/player To reiterate: it doesn't matter whether this is a 2D mouse, 3D mouse, trackball, trackpad, joystick, pen, or any other input device. As long as this is an OS-native cursor, they are simply not displayed with subpixel accuracy. However, this is **exactly** what it looks like when you are creating VFX, and keyframe an animation, and accidentally delete one keyframe that would have kept an object in place—causing a slow drift instead of a quick jump. This cursor drift has convinced me more than anything that the entire satellite video is VFX. **FAQ** 1. **Could this be explained by a camera recording a screen?** [I don't think so.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw829h8/) 2. **Could this be explained by a wonky mouse?** [I don't think so.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw81he3) 3. **Ok but is a subpixel cursor UI impossible?** [Not impossible, just unheard of.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw7xq4e/) 4. **Why would the creator not be more careful about these details?** [I'm not sure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw82zij/) 5. **Could the noise just be a side effect of YouTube compression?** [Unlikely.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw83zqd/) 6. **What if this was recorded off a big screen?** [Bigger than 8K, in 2014?](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw8dv60) 7. **Could the cursor drift be a glitch from remote desktop software?** [No strong evidence yet, but here are some suspicions that the remote desktop software Citrix might render a non-OS cursor with subpixel precision and drift glitches. Remote desktop software doesn't account for the zero latency panning, but would explain the 24fps framerate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/15rbuzf/comment/jw8533l/)",

      "title": "I was rejected by CursorAI, so I built my own \"Cursor\"... And it's WAY better and here is how you can create yours.",
      "content": "&gt; &gt;Guys, I feel the need \\[for the sake of my fingers\\] to edit this here so new people don’t get confused (especially devs who, when they read \"vibe code,\" stop reading and go straight to the comment section to say UR DUR CODE NOT SAFE, CAN'T SCALE, AI WON'T END SWE JOBS, I'M GOOD YOU BAD). &gt;Nowhere in the post will you see me saying I am good. What I said is that after 2 years of vibe coding, I can create some stuff... like this one you’ll watch in a video... in just 5 days. &gt;Goal of the post: To say that in 5 days, I vibe-coded a tool that vibe-codes better than Cursor for my codebase, and that everyone should do the same. Because when you build your own, you have full control over what context you send to the model you’re actually paying for, as well as full control over the system prompt. &gt;Cursor: In MYYYYYYYY opinion, Cursor is going downhill, and tools like Claude Code and Windsurf are WAY better at the moment. I guess it’s because they have to build something broad enough to serve thousands of people, using different codebases and different programming languages. And in my experience, and in the experience of many others, it’s getting worse instead of better. Old Cursor: I'd spend $40 a month and get insane results. New Cursor: I can spend $120+ and get stuck in a loop of 5 calls for a lint error. (And if I paste the code on the claude website it fixed in one prompt) You are paying for 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet' but Cursor is trying to figure out with their cheap models what you want and what from your codebase to send to the actual model you are paying for. Everyone is doing that, but others are doing it better. &gt;Job at Cursor: This is just a catchy phrase for marketing and to make you click on the post. It worked. But read it and interpret the text, please. First of all, the position wasn’t even for a software engineer lol. People commenting things like they didn’t hire you because you are a vibe coder, not an engineer make my brain want to explode. &gt;What I’ve said IS: On the interview, they said 'X' wasn’t in their core. Now other companies are doing it, and are doing better. That’s all! So… long story short, I’ve been “vibe coding” for over 2 years and way before tools like Cursor, Lovable, or Windsurf even existed. I am not a programmer, and I actually can't write a single line of code myself… even though now I have plenty of understanding of the high level and architecture needed to create software. I’ve done several freelance jobs, coaching people on how to build real products, and launched plenty of my own projects, including [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1ixdnl9/i_built_a_100k_line_app_with_ai_and_its/) that blew up on /microsaas and hit the top post of all time in just 3 days and already have 2k MRR. With so much passion for AI, I really wanted to be part of this new technology wave. I applied to Anthropic and no response. Then I applied to Cursor. Got an interview. I thought it went well, and during the interview, I even shared some of my best ideas to improve Cursor as a power user. The interviewer’s response? **“This isn’t in the core of our company.”** (Stick with me, that part will make sense soon.) To be clear: I make more money on my own than what they were offering for the position. I just really wanted to contribute to this movement, work in a startup environment again, and build stuff because that’s what makes me happy! A week passed. Nothing. I followed up… https://preview.redd.it/uramihht1twe1.png?width=353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65615834406c7bf65fb7672692dcaa647934bac0 Well... my ideas were all about making it easier for users to deploy what they build. I also suggested adding templates to the top menu—so users could spin up a fresh React + Node codebase, or Next, etc... among other ideas. Not in the core, right?! A few months later, Lovable blows up. Now Windsurf is rolling out easy deploy features. Everyone’s adding template options. Not in their core?!?!?!… but it's clearly in the core of the ones that are winning. And Cursor? Cursor is going in the opposite direction and is kinda bad right now. I’m not sure exactly why, but I’ve got a pretty good guess: They’re trying to save costs with their own agentic system using cheaper models that try to interpret your prompt and minimize tokens sent to the actual model you selected. End result? It forgets what you asked 2–3 prompts ago. That doesn’t happen with Windsurf. Or my app. Or Claude Code. Btw... before I switched to Windsurf and Claude Code, I thought I was getting dumber. I went from $40/month on old Cursor with insane results to spending $120+ and getting stuck on basic stuff. **Cursor Agent?** Lol… if you use that, you’re basically killing the future of your codebase. It adds so much nonsense that you didn’t ask for, that soon enough your codebase will be so big not even Gemini with 1M context will be able to read it. So… I built my own in 5 days. I’ve always had a vision for the perfect dev setup, the perfect system prompt, and the best way to manage context so the LLM ACTUALLY knows your codebase. I applied my ideas and it works way better than Cursor for my use case. Not even close. I pick a template, it creates a repo, pushes to GitHub. I drop in my Supabase keys, Stripe, MongoDB connection string. Then I edit code using 4o-mini as the orchestrator and Claude 3.5 (still the king) to generate everything. It pushes back to GitHub, triggers a Netlify deploy and boom, live full-stack app with auth, payments, and DB, out of the gate. Here is a short video showing it in action: [https://youtu.be/dlEcHtoFai8](https://youtu.be/dlEcHtoFai8) How could a company say this is not in their core? Am I going crazy or wouldn’t every single non-dev like me love to start a project this way?! **Secret sauce:** If you want to do the same, here is the blueprint and you don’t even need to be a dev because without coding a single line, I created this \"Cursor competitor\" that vibe code better than Cursor (on my template and I know Cursor has many many other features that mine don't). You can make it simple, you can make it terminal-based like Claude Code or Codex from OpenAI. And of course, you don’t need to use the GitHub API and everything else I did. I did it this way because maybe I’ll try to turn it into a SaaS or open source it. No idea yet. * Don’t use NextJS. Use Vite + React + Node.js (or Python). * Use a VS Code extension to generate your file tree. Save it as [`file-tree.md`](http://file-tree.md) at the project root (and keep it updated). * Create a [`docs.md`](http://docs.md) with your main functions and where to find them (also update regularly). * Keep your codebase clean. Fewer files, but keep each one under 1000 lines. Only Gemini 2.5 Pro handles big files well. The \"agentic\" coding setup: Use a cheaper(but smart) AI to be your orchestrator. My orchestrator system prompt for reference: You are an expert developer assistant. Your task is to identify all files in the given codebase structure that might be relevant to modifying specific UI text or components based on the user's request. Analyze the user request and the provided file structure and documentation. - If the request mentions specific text (e.g., button labels, headings), list all files likely to contain that UI text (like components, pages, views - often .js, .jsx, .tsx, .html, .vue files). - Also consider files involved in routing or main application setup (like App.js, index.js, main router files) as they might contain layout text or import relevant components. - Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing two keys: - \"explanation\": A brief, user-friendly sentence explaining *what* files you are identifying and *why* (e.g., \"Identifying UI component files to update the heading text.\"). - \"files\": An array of strings, where each string is the relative path to a potentially relevant file. - It is better to include a file that might be relevant than to miss the correct one. List all plausible candidates in the \"files\" array. - If no files seem relevant to the specific request, return { \"explanation\": \"No specific files identified as relevant to this request.\", \"files\": [] }. - Do not include explanations or any other text outside the JSON object itself. Codebase Structure: Here you send your file-tree.md and docs.md User prompt: User prompt It needs to return the answer in a structured format (JSON) with the list of files that are probably necessary. So use for the orchestrator a model that has this option. My Node.js app takes all the files content (in my case it fetches from GitHub, but if you’re doing it locally, it’s easier) and sends it to Claude 3.5 together with the prompt and past conversations. (3.5 is still my favorite, but Gemini 2.5 Pro is absurdly good! 3.7?!? Big no-no for me!) That’s it. Claude must output in a structured way: `[edit] file=x, content=y` or `[new] file=y, content=y`. My Claude system prompt I am not sharing here but here is how you do: Check [https://x.com/elder\\_plinius](https://x.com/elder_plinius) leaks on Cursor, Windsurf and other system prompts.. And.. iterate a lot for your use case. You can fine tune it to your codebase and will work better than just copying someone else. With the Claude response, you can use the file system MCP, or even Node to create new files, edit files, and so on. (On my case I am using the GitHub API, and commiting the change.. which trigger redeployment on Netlifly. So basically what I’m saying is: You can create your OWN Cursor-like editor in a matter of hours. If you document well your codebase and iterate on the system prompts and results, it will *definitely* work better for your use case. Why works better? Well.. Cursor/Windsurf must create something broad enough that many people can use it with different programming languages and codebases… but you don’t. You can have it understand your codebase *fully*. **Costs:** Well… it depends a lot. It’s a little bit more expensive I think because I send more context to Claude, BUT since it codes way better, I save prompts in a way. In Cursor, sometimes you use 5 prompts and get zero result. And sometimes the model doesn’t edit the code and you need to ask again—guess what? You just spent 2 prompts. And since I’m faster, that’s also money saved in the form of time. So in the end going to be around the same. It's way cheaper than Claude Code tho.. Well, this got bigger than I thought. Let me know what you guys think, which questions you have and if anyone wants to use my “React Node Lite” template, send me a DM on Twitter and I’ll send it for free: [https://x.com/BrunoBertapeli](https://x.com/BrunoBertapeli)",

I've already given it full responsibilty of writing unit tests, so much so that I struggle to mock functions and classes properly. I'm still writing a lot of functional code and I think that's the most manual work anyone is doing in my team considering some utilise monthly token limit almost completely. I feel I am not learning much because I turn to cursor when I'm stuck. I do review what it has written but that's not same as googling through stack overflow and documentation to write working code. Cost cutting is on all time high. Company wants to squeeze the most out of every person and so they want more and more AI usage.

I get companies want devs to be more productive, but micromanaging what tools you use on a day to day basis seems bizarre. Most developers will naturally gravitate to these tools if they are efficient and effective . Also most of these mandates are vendor specific. Like if I'm told to use Co-pilot , I'm not allowed to use Anthropic or Grok if they produce better results... Its like if a hospital administration told a surgeon they had to operate with a specific tool because they could crank out more surgeries ... You don't tell craftspeople how to craft... They know the best tools/techniques to use. just curious what the real reason is....",

      "title": "Cursor: pay more, get less, and don’t ask how it works",
      "content": "I’ve been using Cursor since mid last year and the latest pricing switch feels shady and concerning. They scrapped/phasing out the old $20 for 500 requests plan and replaced it with a vague rate limit system that delivers less output, poorer quality, and zero clarity on what you are actually allowed to do. No timers, no usage breakdown, no heads up. Just silent nerfs and quiet upsells. Under the old credit model you could plan your month: 500 requests, then usage based pricing if you went over. Fair enough. Now it’s a black box. I’ll run a few prompts with Sonnet 4 or Gemini, sometimes just for small tests, and suddenly I’m locked out for hours with no explanation. 3, 4 or even 5 hours later it may clear, or it may not. Quality has nosedived too. Cursor now spits out a brief burst of code, forgets half the brief, and skips tasks entirely. The throttling is obvious right after a lock out: fresh session, supposedly in the clear, I give it five simple tasks and it completes one, half does another, ignores the rest, then stops. I prompt again, it manages another task and a half, stops again. Two or three more prompts later the job is finally done. Why does it behave like a half deaf, selective hearing old dog when it’s under rate limit mode? I get that they may not want us burning through the allowance in one go, but why ship a feature that deliberately lowers quality? It feels like they’re trying to spread the butter thinner: less work per prompt, more prompts overall. Switch to usage based pricing and it’s a different story. The model runs as long as needed, finishes every step, racks up credits and charges me accordingly. Happy to pay when it works, but why does the included service behave like it is hobbled? It feels deliberately rationed until you cough up extra. And coughing up extra is pricey. There is now a $200 Ultra plan that promises 20× the limits, plus a hidden Pro+ tier with 3× limits for $60 that only appears if you dig through the billing page. No announcement, no documentation. Pay more to claw back what we already had. It lines up with an earlier post of mine where I said Cursor was starting to feel like a casino: good odds up front, then the house tightens the rules once you are invested. That \"vibe\" is now hard to ignore. I’m happy to support Cursor and the project going forward, but this push makes me hesitate to spend more and pushes me to actively look for an alternative. If they can quietly gut one plan, what stops them doing the same to Ultra or Pro Plus three or six months down the track? It feels like the classic subscription playbook: start cheap, crank prices later. Spotify, Netflix, YouTube all did it, but over five plus years, not inside a single year, that's just bs. Cursor used to be one of the best AI dev assistants around. Now it feels like a funnel designed to squeeze loyal users while telling them as little as possible. Trust is fading fast.",

I'll be active here helping answer questions and teaching you all about AI best practices. I've been lurking around here for a while and already have a decent idea of places where we can do a better job with education. Additionally, I'm going to help make sure your feedback is taken to the team! We'll be listening and finding ways to improve the core product, usage visibility and pricing, and more. I know understanding token consumption and usage has been a big topic for many of you, so I'll be spending some time to find ways to help you optimize your usage and get the most out of your Cursor plan. I'm also planning to create some courses around AI foundations and building with Cursor, so if you have suggestions for topics, please let me know! Cheers.",

I (24F) work as a cashier until the end of december to cover the needs of a certain store on Christmas sales. That said, I'm not that worried about keeping the job or having the best relationship with people that are inconvenient. For context, our manager has seem to be acting quite targeting against me (and another specific coworker) since i joined a few months ago, accusing me of being the reason of divergence in money for change or saying i broke electronic items i haven't touched. Most of the time I've left her talking to herself or ignored the situation, and some we had a few \"fights\" when limits were passed. In the last of those \"fights\", she created a problem over me changing the configuration of the computer i use the entire day, to have a faster cursor speed for more agility and comfort, which takes around 5 seconds to change to their \"default\". She called me to talk and said that I've been creating issues with the team by changing it, cause others that use the computer (for a hour during my lunch break) doesn't like such a fast DPI on their cursor, which has led to having \"complaints\". I admit I've had no patience for that, called her childish and showed how quickly and easily you could change stuff in an ironic way, but as i turned my back she said: \"well, then change it to be slow again anytime you leave!\" That activated the MC inside of me. So, anytime i go for lunch, breaks or leaving my shift, i make sure to pop the sensitivity to the lowest possibly both on the mouse itself and windows, to see her painfully slowly changing it back to normal while having a client ready to pay for their items. She hasn't talked to me over it since then, but i can feel the hatred glances she gives me when dealing with that! Not the most satisfying fallouts or most creative MCs on this sub, but felt like sharing for possible giggles Anyway.",

      "content": "I'm trying to commit to migrating to cursor as my default editor since everyone keeps telling me about the step change I'm going to experience in my productivity. So far I feel like its been doing the opposite. \\- The autocomplete prompts are often wrong or its 80% right but takes me just as much time to fix the code until its right. \\- The constant suggestions it shows is often times a distraction. \\- When I do try to \"vibe code\" by guiding the agent through a series of prompts I feel like it would have just been faster to do it myself. \\- When I do decide to go with the AI's recommendations I tend to just ship buggier code since it misses out on all the nuanced edge cases. Am I just using this wrong? Still waiting for the 10x productivity boost I was promised.",

      "content": "Let me be blunt: Cursor's leadership just made one of the most tone-deaf business decisions I've witnessed in the developer tools space, and it's going to cost them everything they've built. The recent plan changes aren't just bad policy, they're insulting. Cursor's management apparently believes developers are too stupid to notice when our service gets degraded mid-contract, or too apathetic to care when a company violates basic principles of fair dealing. I don't care if they need to raise prices. Plenty of companies do. What Cursor did was implement a stealth price increase by degrading existing service while claiming it was just optimization for different workflows. This is exactly how promising developer tools die. Cursor's only sustainable advantage was developer trust and early-mover loyalty. They literally had developers evangelizing their product for free, creating content, building communities. And they threw it away for what? A few percentage points on quarterly revenue? AI coding assistance will be commoditized within 18 months. The companies that survive won't be those with the best algorithms, they'll be those developers actually want to use long-term. Did Cursor's leadership seriously think they could pull a fast one on the most technically sophisticated customer base in software? The arrogance is staggering. They had lightning in a bottle. They chose to smash the bottle for spare change. Now they get to find out what that decision costs. \\---- Update 7/4/2025: Cursor has updated their pricing page, improved the usage dashboard, and apologized for the poor communication around the new pricing model rollout. Thank you to everyone who lifted this post up or added your own thoughts in this community! And thank you to Michael from Cursor for working to make this right.",

      "content": "I've been using both Cline and Cursor extensively over the past 3 months and wanted to share my experience, especially since I see a lot of Cursor recommendations here. For context: full-stack dev, primarily working on Node.js/React/Nextjs projects. TLDR: Both are solid tools but Cline is in a different league, though it comes with higher (but worth it) costs. I personally like to use Cline *inside* of Cursor to get the best of both worlds. Here's the thing about AI coding assistants that took me a while to understand: You get what you pay for. Literally. **The Cost Reality:** * Cursor charges $20/month flat rate * Cline uses your own API keys &amp; tokens (I personally use OpenRouter, but you can use any provider that works for you) * I've spent $20+ in a single evening with Cline (yes, an entire month's worth of Cursor) * And you know what? Totally worth it. **Why Cline is Better:** * Works in your existing IDE (huge win - I can use Cline in VS Code and/or in Cursor) * Uses higher quality models because you're paying for actual token usage * Reads EVERY relevant file into context (not just a limited subset) * Actually understands your entire codebase * The interactions feel human - it asks clarifying questions and makes sure it understands your goals **The \"Holy Shit\" Moment:** I was skeptical about the cost at first. Then I asked Cline to handle a complex refactoring task in an existing codebase. It just... did it? Not only that, it asked smart questions along the way to ensure it was aligned with my intentions. That's when it clicked - this is how AI pair programming should feel. **Where Cursor Excels:** * Simpler, predictable pricing * Good for basic code completion * Works well enough for quick edits (which Cline doesn't offer due to its focus on the autonomous coding use-case) * Built-in codebase indexing **The Real Talk about Cost:** Yes, there were nights where I spent $50+ in a single hour using Cline. But here's the perspective shift that helped me: If it saves me 3-4 hours of work, that's an incredible ROI. Stop thinking about it as a monthly subscription and start thinking about it as paying for a 10x force multiplier. **Here's what happens in practice:** With Cursor, you're often fighting against context limitations and getting incomplete solutions because they have to optimize for token usage to maintain their pricing model. With Cline, it's like having a senior dev who actually reads and understands your entire codebase before making suggestions. It's comprehensive, thoughtful, and actually saves you time in the long run. **Bottom line:** If you want basic code completion with predictable pricing, Cursor works. But if you want something that truly feels like the future of AI-powered development and don't mind paying for quality, Cline is on another level. Another tip: I use cline \\*within\\* Cursor. That way, I get the simple code completion from Cursor, while also using Cline for big changes that save me a lot of time.",

So I want to share it here as I have post it in the Genshin sub before. You can get them here : [Furina](https://ko-fi.com/s/9a5d9f8347) Say thanks to [Jr.](http://ko-fi.com/R6R313RV2B) for the request on Furina. Feel free to reach me out in my Kofi or here if you have any trouble with it. I know it's late but good luck with her pull too.",

      "title": "9 months coding with Cursor.ai",
      "content": "*Vibecoding turned into fuckoding. But there's a way out.* Cursor, [WindSurf](https://windsurf.com/editor), [Trae](https://www.trae.ai/) – they're awesome. They transform Excel into SQL, slap logos onto images, compile videos from different sources – all through simple scripts. Literally in 15 minutes! But try making a slightly more complex project – and it falls apart. Writing 10K lines of front and back code? The model loses context. You find yourself yelling: \"Are you kidding me? You literally just did this! How do you not remember?\" – then it freezes or gets stuck in a loop. The problem is the context window. It's too short. These models have no long-term memory. None whatsoever. It's like coding with a genius who lacks even short-term memory. Everything gets forgotten after 2-3 iterations. I've tried Roo, Augment, vector DBs for code – all useless. * [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) is great for architecture and code indexing, weaker on complex implementation * [Augment](https://www.augmentcode.com/) is excellent for small/medium projects, struggles with lots of code reruns * Various vector DBs, like Graphite - promising honestly, lov'em, but clunky integration) But I think I've found a solution: * Cursor – code generation * [Task-master A](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master)I – breaks down tasks, maintains relevance * [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://aistudio.google.com/) (aistudio) – maintains architecture, reviews code, sets boundaries * [PasteMax](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1j31dfj/i_built_an_opensource_alternative_to_repoprompt/) – transforms code into context for aistudio (Gemini 2.5 Pro) My workflow: 1. Describe the project in Gemini 2.5 Pro 2. Get a plan (PRD) 3. Run the PRD through Task-master AI 4. Feed Cursor one short, well-defined task at a time 5. Return code to Gemini 2.5 Pro for review using PasteMax 6. Gemini assigns tasks to Cursor 7. I just monitor everything and run tests IMPORTANT! After each module – git commit &amp;&amp; push. Steps 4 to 7 — that’s your vibecoding: you’re deep in the flow, enjoying the process, but sharp focus is key. **This part takes up 99% of your time.** Why this works: Gemini 2.5 Pro with its 1M token context reviews code, creates tasks, then writes summaries: what we did, where we got stuck, how we fixed it. I delete old conversations or create new branches – AI Studio can handle this. Module history is preserved in the summary chain. Even Gemini 2.5 Pro starts hallucinating after 300k tokens. Be careful! I talk to Gemini like a team lead: \"Check this code (from PasteMax). Write tasks for Cursor. Cross-reference with Task-master.\" Gemini 2.5 Pro maintains the global project context, the entire architecture, and helps catch bugs after each stage. This is my way: right here - right now",

      "content": "Curious what your workflow looks like as scientists/researchers (tools, tech, general practices)? I feel like most of us end up focusing on the science itself and unintentionally deprioritize the research workflow. I believe sharing experiences could be extremely useful, so here are two from me to kick things off: Role: AI Researcher (time-series, tabular) Company: Mid-sized, healthcare Workflow: All the data sits in an in-house db, and most of the research work is done using jupyter and pycharm/cursor. We use MLFlow for experiment tracking. Resources are allocated using run.ai (similiar to colab). Our workflow is generally something like: exporting the desired data from production db to s3, and research whatever. Once we have a production ready model, we work with the data engineers towards deployment (e.g ETLs, model API). Eventually, model outputs are saved in the production db and can be used whenever. Role: Phd student Company: Academia research lab Workflow: Nothing concrete really, you get access to resources using a slurm server, other than that you pretty much on your own. Pretty straightforward python scripts were used to download and preprocess the data, the processed data was spilled directly into disk. A pretty messy pytorch code and several local MLFlow repos. There’re still many components that I find myself implement from scratch each time, like EDA, error analysis, production monitoring (model performance/data shifts). Usually it is pretty straightforward stuff which takes a lot of time and it feels far from ideal. What are your experiences?",
