      "content": "A lot of people (like me) dive into ML thinking it's about understanding intelligence, learning, or even just clever math ‚Äî and then they wake up buried under a pile of frameworks, configs, random seeds, hyperparameter grids, and Google Colab crashes. And the worst part? No one tells you how undefined the field really is until you're *knee-deep in the swamp.* In mathematics: * There's structure. Rigor. A kind of calm beauty in clarity. * You can prove something and *know* it‚Äôs true. * You explore the unknown, yes ‚Äî but on solid ground. In ML: * You fumble through a foggy mess of tunable knobs and lucky guesses. * ‚ÄúReproducibility‚Äù is a fantasy. * Half the field is just ‚Äúwhat worked better for us‚Äù and the other half is trying to explain it *after* the fact. * Nobody *really* knows why half of it works, and yet they act like they do.",

      "content": "hello, as the question states, I‚Äôm looking to learn ML in my 2nd year as a CS student. This field has always interested me ‚Äî the idea of creating an algorithm that can automate a really complex task, not something simple like sorting a list, but one that takes into account many changing variables depending on the situation. That‚Äôs fascinating to me, to say the least. From what I‚Äôve researched, I know that it requires a solid understanding of mathematics as well as data structures. Of course, there‚Äôs much more to it, but I just want to kickstart my learning and build momentum. Lately, I‚Äôve mainly been learning C, since I believe it‚Äôs important to first understand how a computer truly works before diving into frameworks and libraries. My first language is Python, and I know libraries like scikit-learn exist, but I don‚Äôt want to rely on them just yet ‚Äî at least not before I make my own model from scratch to really understand how it works. Maybe I‚Äôm being a bit ambitious, or maybe I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm getting into, but I genuinely want to become a good software engineer, someone who is always pushing for deeper understanding. Right now, the last concepts I‚Äôve studied are OOP in Python and pointers in C. For my 2nd year, I want to build on that foundation and aim for a greater level of understanding. I also want to spend the rest of this holiday learning as much as I can. So my question is: **can anyone recommend resources books, websites, or anything else that teach the fundamentals I need to start building my first ML model while also helping me grow as a software engineer?**",

      "title": "Kyrie Irving quotes are almost indistinguishable from a machine learning artificial intelligence",
      "content": "I‚Äôm serious... when I see a kyrie quote without an accompanying video, I‚Äôm always suspicious it‚Äôs actually something written by a machine learning artificial intelligence. For fun I went to https://talktotransformer.com/ and gave it the starting prompt **‚Äùbasketball is about more than winning games...‚Äù** Here‚Äôs what the website spat out. Tell me this doesn‚Äôt sound like something Kyrie would say: &gt; Basketball is about more than winning games. It's also about achieving an ultimate and lasting legacy. It's all about brothers, cousins, teachers and coaches who helped mold these seven young men into the men they are today, men who aspire to be the best in the world. No two young men with similar backgrounds, goals and outlooks have ever come together on the basketball court. When you win games and get near the Finals, you win an organization, you win a loyalty, you win a relationship with fans and you're seeing more players who are going to become all-stars of this game. So I think winning plays a major role. Here‚Äôs another one: &gt; **I don‚Äôt worry about what the basketball fans think.** I understand when I play the way I do. I know I need to put more out there to make a game, and I feel great. I don't think I feel any less than I do at any point in my career, so if you don't know that, I think I just gave the basketball fans an indication. It's nothing more than that. I'm not looking for my name to be out there. I know I can play, and I'm looking forward to the next. What matters is how it is for those outside the sport and how they feel. If you‚Äôre going to work for this organization, you‚Äôre going to feel the pain of those who go there. We care about that. Those are the things that you‚Äôre going to hear a lot from us. That is why I believe in this organization and that is why I believe in myself as an athlete. --- To prove my point further, I took some of that machine-generated text, had Watson's text-to-speech read it for me, used then used a rough deepfake lipsync tech to generate **this video: https://youtu.be/E6MZrOd7zbg** Almost no part of this is human Kyrie. Granted, this is extremely rough and done in minutes, but imagine someone with more skill? **Are we even sure Kyrie Irving is a real person?** --- FWIW, one of these quotes is allegedly real and the other is something I machine generated: **Quote 1:** \"*At the end of the day it's an entertainment league.* It's a circus, the fans are rabid and it's unpredictable. For most of the people who get into it and follow it closely, it's a fun show to be a part of. What's the point of winning if you can't have fun with it? If we go all out, and if we do something here and there, it will be fun. There are ups and downs, there are bad days, and there are good days. We just need to stay consistent. I just think that's the only way to go.\" **Quote 2:** \"*At the end of the day, it's an entertainment league.* We're very drama filled. Everything regurgitates on all these media platforms which is part of our society. I can't do anything about it except be a pillar in our locker room, be very communicative, and when I'm out there with the guys just impact winning. ... Good luck figuring out which is which. **TL;DR: [We are reaching a point (or have already reached it) where Kyrie Irving is indistinguishable from a machine learning artificial intelligence](https://youtu.be/E6MZrOd7zbg)**",

      "title": "How I Started Learning Machine Learning",
      "content": "Hello, everyone. As promised, I'll write a longer post about how I entered the world of ML, hoping it will help someone shape their path. I'll include links to all the useful materials I used alongside the story, which you can use for learning. I like to call myself an AI Research Scientist who enjoys exploring new AI trends, delving deeper into understanding their background, and applying them to real products. This way, I try to connect science and entrepreneurship because I believe everything that starts as scientific research ends up \"on the shelves\" as a product that solves a specific user problem. I began my journey in ML in 2016 when it wasn't such a popular field. Everyone had heard of it, but few were applying it. I have several years of development experience and want to try my hand at ML. The first problem I encountered was where to start - whether to learn mathematics, statistics, or something else. That's when I came across a name and a course that completely changed my career. # Let's start You guessed it. It was Professor Andrew Ng and his globally popular Machine Learning course available on Coursera (I still have the certificate, hehe). This was also my first official online course ever. Since that course no longer exists as it's been replaced by a new one, I recommend you check out: 1. [Machine Learning (Stanford CS229)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) 2. [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) These two courses start from the basics of ML and all the necessary calculus you need to know. Many always ask questions like whether to learn linear algebra, statistics, or probability, but you don't need to know everything in depth. This knowledge helps if you're a scientist developing a new architecture, but as an engineer, not really. You need to know some basics to understand, such as how the backpropagation algorithm works. I know that Machine Learning (Stanford CS229) is a very long and arduous course, but it's the right start if you want to be really good at ML. In my time, I filled two thick notebooks by hand while taking the course mentioned above. # TensorFlow and Keras After the course, I didn't know how to apply my knowledge because I hadn't learned specifically how to code things. Then, I was looking for ways to learn how to code it. That's when I came across a popular framework called Keras, now part of TensorFlow. I started with a new course and acquiring practical knowledge: 1. [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 2. [Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) 3. [Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Ng](https://info.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning-book) These resources above were my next step. I must admit that I learned the most from that course and from the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow because I like reading books (although this one is quite difficult to read). # Learn by coding To avoid just learning, I went through various GitHub repositories that I manually retyped and learned that way. It may be an old-fashioned technique, but it helped me a lot. Now, most of those repositories don't exist, so I'll share some that I found to be good: 1. [Really good Jupyter notebooks that can teach you the basics of TensorFlow](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) 2. [Another good repo for learning TF and Keras](https://github.com/codebasics/deep-learning-keras-tf-tutorial) # Master the challenge After mastering the basics in terms of programming in TF/Keras, I wanted to try solving some real problems. There's no better place for that challenge than Kaggle and the popular Titanic dataset. Here, you can really find a bunch of materials and simple examples of ML applications. Here are some of my favorites: 1. [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) 2. [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview) 3. [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 4. [Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/two-sigma-financial-news) I then decided to further develop my career in the direction of applying ML to the stock market, first using predictions on time series and then using natural language processing. I've remained in this field until today and will defend my doctoral dissertation soon. # How to deploy models To continue, before I move on to the topic of specialization, we need to address the topic of deployment. Now that we've learned how to make some basic models in Keras and how to use them, there are many ways and services, but I'll only mention what I use today. For all my ML models, whether simple regression models or complex GPT models, I use FastAPI. It's a straightforward framework, and you can quickly create API endpoints. I'll share a few older and useful tutorials for beginners: 1. [AI as an API tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56qQNcHJxyQ) 2. [A step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/@ganiyuabdulwajeed2002/a-step-by-step-approach-to-building-a-fast-api-for-deep-learning-classification-projects-cbd2ea6bc2f2) 3. [Productizing an ML Model with FastAPI and Cloud Run](https://medium.com/semantixbr/deploy-an-ml-model-with-fastapi-and-cloud-run-part-1-1a0b0f3b3a5d) Personally, I've deployed on various cloud providers, of which I would highlight GCP and AWS because they have everything needed for model deployment, and if you know how to use them, they can be quite cheap. # Chose your specialization The next step in developing my career, besides choosing finance as the primary area, was my specialization in the field of NLP. This happened in early 2020 when I started working with models based on the Transformer architecture. The first model I worked with was BERT, and the first tasks were related to classifications. My recommendations are to master the Transformer architecture well because 99% of today's LLM models are based on it. Here are some resources: 1. [The legendary paper \"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) 2. [Hugging Face Course on Transformers](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) 3. [Illustrated Guide to Transformers - Step by Step Explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-transformers-step-by-step-explanation-f74876522bc0) 4. [Good repository](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials) 5. [How large language models work, a visual intro to transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) After spending years using encoder-based Transformer models, I started learning GPT models. Good open-source models like Llama 2 then appear. Then, I started fine-tuning these models using the excellent Unsloth library: 1. [How to Finetune Llama-3 and Export to Ollama](https://docs.unsloth.ai/tutorials/how-to-finetune-llama-3-and-export-to-ollama) 2. [Fine-tune Llama 3.1 Ultra-Efficiently with Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/sft-llama3) After that, I focused on studying various RAG techniques and developing Agent AI systems. This is now called AI engineering, and, as far as I can see, it has become quite popular. So I'll write more about that in another post, but here I'll leave what I consider to be the three most famous representatives, i.e., their tutorials: 1. [LangChain tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/) 2. [LangGraph tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/) 3. [CrewAI examples](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples) # Here I am today Thanks to the knowledge I've generated over all these years in the field of ML, I've developed and worked on numerous projects. The most significant publicly available project is developing an agent AI system for well-being support, which I turned into a [mobile application](https://sintelly.com/download/). Also, my entire doctoral dissertation is related to applying ML to the stock market in combination with the development of GPT models and reinforcement learning (more on that in a separate post). After long 6 years, I've completed my dissertation, and now I'm just waiting for its defense. I'll share everything I'm working on for the dissertation publicly [on the project](https://primoinvesting.com/), and in tutorials I'm preparing to write. If you're interested in these topics, I announce that I'll soon start with activities of publishing content on Medium and a blog, but I'll share all of that here on Reddit as well. Now that I've gathered years of experience and knowledge in this field, I'd like to share it with others and help as much as possible. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them, and I'll try to answer all of them. Thank you for reading.",

It allows anyone to upload data of potential exoplanets, planets outside the Solar System, from the Kelper mission, a space telescope designed to hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way, and train a custom machine learning model, select classifiers and tweak their main hyperparameters, on it. You can freely build their own model by selecting from multiple estimators (random forest, gradient boosting, and multi-layer perceptron) and adjust each one's primary hyperparameters. After model training, you upload a new dataset without the exoplanet disposition, with only the feature to run predictions on it using the saved model.

Specifically, I‚Äôd love to hear about: - how particular sound categories were developed or negotiated, - how disagreements around classification were handled, and - how teams decided what counted as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúusable‚Äù data point. If you‚Äôve been involved in building, maintaining, or labeling sound datasets - from environmental sounds to event ontologies - I‚Äôd be very grateful to talk. Conversations are confidential, and I can share more details about the project and consent process if you‚Äôre interested. You can DM me here Thanks so much for your time and for all the work that goes into shaping this fascinating field.",

      "content": "Hi r/MachineLearning, here is my weekend project: [chess-cv](https://github.com/S1M0N38/chess-cv) A machine learning project that trains a lightweight CNN (156k parameters) from scratch to classify chess pieces from 32√ó32 pixel square images. The model achieves ~99.85% accuracy on synthetic training data generated by combining 55 board styles (256√ó256px) with 64 piece sets (32√ó32px) from chess.com and lichess. By rendering pieces onto different board backgrounds and extracting individual squares, the model learns robust piece recognition across various visual styles. | Dataset | Accuracy | F1-Score (Macro) | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----------------: | | Test Data | 99.85% | 99.89% | | [S1M0N38/chess-cv-openboard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/S1M0N38/chess-cv-openboard) | - | 95.78% | (OpenBoard has an unbalanced class distribution (many more samples for empty square class, so accuracy is not representative ) Happy to hear any feedback!",

Last year, I shared with you a job board for [FAANG positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ia7feh/p_made_a_faang_job_postings_aggregator_for_ai/) and due to the positive feedback I received, I had been working on expanded version called [hire.watch](https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+_+Machine+Learning) The goal is provide a unified search experience - it crawls, cleans and extracts data, allowing filtering by: 1. Full-text search 2. Location - on-site 3. Remote - from a given city, US state, EU, etc. 4. Category - you can check out the machine learning category here: [https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+\\_+Machine+Learning](https://hire.watch/?categories=AI+_+Machine+Learning) 5. Years of experience and seniority 6. Target gross salary 7. Date posted and date modified I used the normal ML ecosystem (scikit learn, huggingface transformers, LLMs, etc.) to build it, and Plotly Dash for the UI. Let me know what you think - feel free to ask questions and request features :)",

      "content": "Imagine you're someone who is attempting to dip a toe into ML research in 2025. Say, a new graduate student. You say to yourself \"I want to do some research today\". Very quickly you realize the following: **Who's my competition?** Just a handful of billion-dollar tech giants, backed by some of the world's most powerful governments, with entire armies of highly paid researchers whose only job is to discover interesting research questions. These researchers have access to massive, secret knowledge graphs that tell them exactly where the next big question will pop up before anyone else even has a chance to realize it exists. Once LLMs mature even more, they'll probably just automate the process of generating and solving research problems. What's better than pumping out a shiny new paper every day? **Where would I start?** Both the Attention and the ADAM paper has 200k citation. That basically guarantees there‚Äôs no point in even trying to research these topics. Ask yourself what more could you possibly contribute to something that‚Äôs been cited 200,000 times. But this is not the only possible topic. Pull out any topic in ML, say image style transfer, there are already thousands of follow-up papers on that. Aha, maybe you could just read the most recent ones from this year. Except, you quickly realize that most of those so-called ‚Äúpapers‚Äù are from shady publish-or-perish paper-mills (which are called \"universities\" nowadays, am I being too sarcastic?) or just the result of massive GPU clusters funded by millions of dollars instant-access revenue that you don‚Äôt have access to. **I‚Äôll just do theory!** Maybe let's just forget the real world and dive into theory instead. But to do theory, you‚Äôll need a ton of math. What‚Äôs typically used in ML theory? Well, one typically starts with optimization, linear algebra and probability. But wait, you quickly realize that‚Äôs not enough. So you go on to master more topics in applied math: ODEs, PDEs, SDEs, and don‚Äôt forget game theory, graph theory and convex optimization. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. You‚Äôll need to dive into Bayesian statistics, information theory. Still isn‚Äôt enough. Turns out, you will need pure math as well: measure theory, topology, homology, group, field, and rings. At some point, you realize this is still not enough and now you need to think more like Andrew Wiles. So you go on to tackle some seriously hard topics such as combinatorics and computational complexity theory. What is all good for in the end? Oh right, to prove some regret bound that absolutely no one cares about. What was the regret bound for ADAM again? It's right in the paper, Theorem 1, cited 200k times, and nobody as far as I'm aware of even knows what it is.",

      "content": "I‚Äôm a Senior ML engineer with around 9 years of experience. I work at a large government institution, implementing (integrating?) AI for cybersecurity, and I‚Äôm currently in the process of building a new team. I‚Äôve been having some concerns about my career development, and I‚Äôm not sure if other ML engineers with similar experience feel the same way. Most of my projects these days aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù anymore. It‚Äôs mostly using existing models through APIs, setting up pipelines, etc. The actual algorithmic/experimental side of ML feels like it‚Äôs disappearing from my day-to-day work. It seems like the industry has shifted from building models to API calls and prompt engineering. I miss the kind of work I did in my earlier roles, building models from scratch, fine-tuning, experimenting‚Ä¶ So my question is: is this just what senior ML roles eventually turn into? Has the job really shifted from ‚Äúbuilding ML‚Äù to ‚Äúplugging in ML‚Äù? Curious if others are experiencing the same thing. I have been experiencing this since the generative AI boom where suddenly everything was solvable.. (Disclaimer: we do use on-prem models at my organization, so I still get some hands-on time with models and fine-tuning using LoRA.)",
