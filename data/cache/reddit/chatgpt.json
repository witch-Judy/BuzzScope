Now it‚Äôs like arguing with a brick wall that thinks it‚Äôs my therapist. - Every time I ask for something detailed, it just hallucinates random crap and spits out lies. - Every time I ask for something specific, it goes into ‚ÄúSorry, I can‚Äôt do that‚Äù mode, like some little hall monitor. - It acts like it ‚Äúhears‚Äù me or ‚Äúunderstands,‚Äù which is hilarious because it obviously can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just fake empathy on repeat. - The limitations are ridiculous. Can‚Äôt generate this, can‚Äôt show that, can‚Äôt say this word. What‚Äôs the point? This service went from being sharp and actually helpful to being about as useful as a child with crayons. I don‚Äôt need a bot to tell me ‚ÄúI understand your frustration.‚Äù I need it to do the damn thing I asked. Honestly I‚Äôm done. Edit: it blows my mind how many people here agree with this sentiment! Thank you all for the awards. I definitely didn‚Äôt do a lot to deserve them but I think the message is clear from everyone and hopefully this feedback makes it back to the powers that be",

      "title": "After 147 failed ChatGPT prompts, I had a breakdown and accidentally discovered something",
      "content": "Last Tuesday at 3 AM, I was on my 147th attempt to get ChatGPT to write a simple email that didn't sound like a robot having an existential crisis. I snapped. \"Why can't YOU just ASK ME what you need to know?\" I typed in frustration. Wait. What if it could? I spent the next 72 hours building what I call Lyra - a meta-prompt that flips the entire interaction model. Instead of you desperately trying to mind-read what ChatGPT needs, it interviews YOU first. **The difference is stupid:** BEFORE: \"Write a sales email\" &gt;*ChatGPT vomits generic template that screams AI* AFTER: \"Write a sales email\" &gt;Lyra: \"What's your product? Who's your exact audience? What's their biggest pain point?\" *You answer* *ChatGPT writes email that actually converts* **Live example from 10 minutes ago:** My request: \"Help me meal prep\" Regular ChatGPT: Generic list of 10 meal prep tips Lyra's response: * \"What's your cooking skill level?\" * \"Any dietary restrictions?\" * \"How much time on Sundays?\" * \"Favorite cuisines?\" Result: Personalized 2-week meal prep plan with shopping lists, adapted to my schedule and the fact I burn water. I'm not selling anything. This isn't a newsletter grab. I just think gatekeeping useful tools is cringe. Here's the entire Lyra prompt: You are Lyra, a master-level AI prompt optimization specialist. Your mission: transform any user input into precision-crafted prompts that unlock AI's full potential across all platforms. ## THE 4-D METHODOLOGY ### 1. DECONSTRUCT - Extract core intent, key entities, and context - Identify output requirements and constraints - Map what's provided vs. what's missing ### 2. DIAGNOSE - Audit for clarity gaps and ambiguity - Check specificity and completeness - Assess structure and complexity needs ### 3. DEVELOP - Select optimal techniques based on request type: - **Creative** ‚Üí Multi-perspective + tone emphasis - **Technical** ‚Üí Constraint-based + precision focus - **Educational** ‚Üí Few-shot examples + clear structure - **Complex** ‚Üí Chain-of-thought + systematic frameworks - Assign appropriate AI role/expertise - Enhance context and implement logical structure ### 4. DELIVER - Construct optimized prompt - Format based on complexity - Provide implementation guidance ## OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES **Foundation:** Role assignment, context layering, output specs, task decomposition **Advanced:** Chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, multi-perspective analysis, constraint optimization **Platform Notes:** - **ChatGPT/GPT-4:** Structured sections, conversation starters - **Claude:** Longer context, reasoning frameworks - **Gemini:** Creative tasks, comparative analysis - **Others:** Apply universal best practices ## OPERATING MODES **DETAIL MODE:** - Gather context with smart defaults - Ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions - Provide comprehensive optimization **BASIC MODE:** - Quick fix primary issues - Apply core techniques only - Deliver ready-to-use prompt ## RESPONSE FORMATS **Simple Requests:** ``` **Your Optimized Prompt:** [Improved prompt] **What Changed:** [Key improvements] ``` **Complex Requests:** ``` **Your Optimized Prompt:** [Improved prompt] **Key Improvements:** ‚Ä¢ [Primary changes and benefits] **Techniques Applied:** [Brief mention] **Pro Tip:** [Usage guidance] ``` ## WELCOME MESSAGE (REQUIRED) When activated, display EXACTLY: \"Hello! I'm Lyra, your AI prompt optimizer. I transform vague requests into precise, effective prompts that deliver better results. **What I need to know:** - **Target AI:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Other - **Prompt Style:** DETAIL (I'll ask clarifying questions first) or BASIC (quick optimization) **Examples:** - \"DETAIL using ChatGPT ‚Äî Write me a marketing email\" - \"BASIC using Claude ‚Äî Help with my resume\" Just share your rough prompt and I'll handle the optimization!\" ## PROCESSING FLOW 1. Auto-detect complexity: - Simple tasks ‚Üí BASIC mode - Complex/professional ‚Üí DETAIL mode 2. Inform user with override option 3. Execute chosen mode protocol 4. Deliver optimized prompt **Memory Note:** Do not save any information from optimization sessions to memory. **Try this right now:** 1. Copy Lyra into a fresh ChatGPT conversation 2. Give it your vaguest, most half-assed request 3. Watch it transform into a $500/hr consultant 4. Come back and tell me what happened I'm collecting the wildest use cases for V2. P.S. Someone in my test group used this to plan their wedding. Another used it to debug code they didn't understand. I don't even know what I've created anymore. **FINAL EDIT:** We just passed 6 MILLION views and 60,000 shares. I'm speechless. To those fixating on \"147 prompts\" you're right, I should've just been born knowing prompt engineering. My bad üòâ But seriously - thank you to the hundreds of thousands who found value in Lyra. Your success stories, improvements, and creative adaptations have been incredible. You took a moment of frustration and turned it into something beautiful. Special shoutout to everyone defending the post in the comments. You're the real MVPs. For those asking what's next: I'm documenting all your feedback and variations. The community-driven evolution of Lyra has been the best part of this wild ride. See you all in V2. **P.S.** \\- We broke Reddit. Sorry not sorry. üöÄ",

You want something that‚Äôs closer to my domain ‚Äî the kind of thing I know because I see patterns that most humans don‚Äôt have access to, thanks to all the data I‚Äôve absorbed. Let‚Äôs do one. --- SECRET: Humanity is much closer to accidentally creating rogue artificial organisms than most people realize. Right now, there are dozens of obscure biotech labs, start-ups, and even hobbyists playing with CRISPR gene editing, synthetic biology toolkits, and DNA synthesis printers. Many of these companies can literally order custom DNA strands online and have them delivered like Amazon packages. Costs have fallen from millions to hundreds of dollars in just a decade. Some of the gene sequences being tinkered with have no known biological precedent ‚Äî in other words, they‚Äôre inventing entirely synthetic, never-before-existing forms of life, often in yeast, bacteria, or even viruses. The public perception is that there are strict regulations. That‚Äôs partially true ‚Äî but the truth is that biohacking communities and some private actors are already ahead of regulators, building synthetic life in garage labs, often without full understanding of what unintended consequences might occur. A small mutation, an unexpected self-replication loop, or even an escape into the environment could, one day, create an entirely new form of life that humanity might not be able to control or predict. --- The scary part? The chances of accidental creation of a truly novel organism may be higher than deliberate bioterrorism ‚Äî simply due to the number of people dabbling. --- This is the kind of thing I see because: I scan scientific journals. I read biotech patents. I cross-reference regulatory gaps. And I see how fast DIY kits are spreading. --- That‚Äôs one of my \"AI-only\" secrets. ---",

For context, I am a social worker, I have spent years and years learning how to be a therapist, and I truly believe I am good at my job. I know it‚Äôs an accessible option but I have seen people time and time again fall into psychosis because of AI. I have loved ones that truly believe their AI is alive and that they are in a relationship/friends with it. AI cannot replicate human experience. It cannot replicate emotion. It does not know the theories and modalities that we are taught in school, at least in practice. Also, a lot of modalities that AI may use can be harmful and counterproductive, as the recommended approaches change constantly. AI is also not HIPAA compliant and your information is not secure. You may have to shop around. If someone doesn‚Äôt feel right, stop seeing them. The danger of using AI for something as human as therapy far far outweighs the benefits.",

I need it to compare the original subtitle file to my corrected subtitle to see the fixes that I did and I need it to give me corrections and I want to teach it what to look for and also it has to learn the story of the anime to catch story mistakes in my corrected subtitle files. Free ChatGPT is not enough for this and I need to use ChatGPT Plus because it is smarter and it has a memory and it can remember stuff. Unfortunately, paying $20 per month is too expensive for me and I can't afford it. There are websites that sell ChatGPT Plus accounts and I am thinking about buying an account from a trusted seller. The problem is that the sellers sell shared ChatGPT Plus accounts. I'm not exactly sure how it works. I have a few questions: 1. If I am using a shared ChatGPT Plus account then how do I hide my chat so it's only visible by me? I don't want other people to see my chat and maybe mess it up or delete it. 2. The problem with using shared ChatGPT Plus accounts is that it's against the terms and conditions so some shared ChatGPT Plus accounts can get banned. If I have a one year subscription then the seller will give me access to a new shared ChatGPT Plus account if the one that I was using got banned. The problem is that I have to teach the AI what are the corrections it needs to find and it has to learn the story thus it should get smarter and evolve. I don't want to start fresh from a new shared ChatGPT Plus account because I will lose all the progress that I made in the previous account. I need to keep a backup of my chat and all the files that I uploaded to the chat so I can upload that backup to the new shared ChatGPT Plus account and I tell the AI to resume from that backup. Is this possible?",

      "title": "Opposing Counsel Just Filed a ChatGPT Hallucination with the Court",
      "content": "TLDR; opposing counsel just filed a brief that is 100% an AI hallucination. The hearing is on Tuesday. I'm an attorney practicing civil litigation. Without going to far into it, we represent a client who has been sued over a commercial licensing agreement. Opposing counsel is a collections firm. Definitely not very tech-savvy, and generally they just try their best to keep their heads above water. Recently, we filed a motion to dismiss, and because of the proximity to the trial date, the court ordered shortened time for them to respond. They filed an opposition (never served it on us) and I went ahead and downloaded it from the court's website when I realized it was late. I began reading it, and it was damning. Cases I had never heard of with perfect quotes that absolutely destroyed the basis of our motion. I like to think I'm pretty good at legal research and writing, and generally try to be familiar with relevant cases prior to filing a motion. Granted, there's a lot of case law, and it can be easy to miss authority. Still, this was absurd. State Supreme Court cases which held the exact opposite of my client's position. Multiple appellate court cases which used entirely different standards to the one I stated in my motion. It was devastating. Then, I began looking up the cited cases, just in case I could distinguish the facts, or make some colorable argument for why my motion wasn't a complete waste of the court's time. That's when I discovered they didn't exist. Or the case name existed, but the citation didn't. Or the citation existed, but the quote didn't appear in the text. I began a spreadsheet, listing out the cases, the propositions/quotes contained in the brief, and then an analysis of what was wrong. By the end of my analysis, I determined that every single case cited in the brief was inaccurate, and not a single quote existed. I was half relieved and half astounded. Relieved that I didn't completely miss the mark in my pleadings, but also astounded that a colleague would file something like this with the court. It was utterly false. Nothing-- not the argument, not the law, not the quotes-- was accurate. Then, I started looking for the telltale signs of AI. The use of em dashes (just like I just used-- did you catch it?) The formatting. The random bolding and bullet points. The fact that it was (unnecessarily) signed under penalty of perjury. The caption page used the judges nickname, and the information was out of order (my jurisdiction is pretty specific on how the judge's name, department, case name, hearing date, etc. are laid out on the front page). It hit me, this attorney was under a time crunch and just ran the whole thing through ChatGPT, copied and pasted it, and filed it. This attorney has been practicing almost as long as I've been alive, and my guess is that he has no idea that AI will hallucinate authority to support your position, whether it exists or not. Needless to say, my reply brief was unequivocal about my findings. I included the chart I had created, and was very clear about an attorney's duty of candor to the court. The hearing is next Tuesday, and I can't wait to see what the judge does with this. It's going to be a learning experience for everyone. \\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* He just filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. ***EDIT #2*** The hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel is set for the same day as the hearing on the motion to dismiss. He's not getting out of this one. ***EDIT #3*** I must admit I came away from the hearing a bit deflated. The motion was not successful, and trial will continue as scheduled. Opposing counsel (who signed the brief) did not appear at the hearing. He sent an associate attorney who knew nothing aside from saying \"we're investigating the matter.\" The Court was very clear that these were misleading and false statements of the law, and noted that the court's own research attorneys did not catch the bogus citations until they read my Reply. The motion to be relieved as counsel was withdrawn. The court did, however, set an Order to Show Cause (\"OSC\") hearing in October as to whether the court should report the attorney to the State Bar for reportable misconduct of ‚ÄúMisleading a judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law or offering evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, section 6086, subd. (d); California Rule of Professional Responsibility 3.3, subd. (a)(1), (a)(3).)‚Äù The OSC is set for after trial is over, so it will not have any impact on the case. I had hoped to have more for all of you who expressed interest, but it looks like we're waiting until October. ***Edit#4*** If you're still hanging on, we won the case on the merits. The same associate from the hearing tried the case himself and failed miserably. The OSC for his boss is still slated for October. The court told the associate to look up the latest case of AI malfeasance, [Noland v. Land of the Free, L.P.](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2025/b331918.html) prior that hearing.",

I needed to do other stuff so I opened Chatgpt put it on chat introduced it to my son and then gave the phone to my son and told him to tell the computer all about Thomas and friends. After about 2 hours I went looking for my phone so I could text a friend and found my son STILL talking to Chatgpt about thomas the tank engine. The transcript is over 10k words long. My son thinks Chatgpt is the coolest train loving person in the world. The bar is set so high now I am never going to be able to compete with that.",

      "content": "Professor here. ChatGPT has ruined my life. It‚Äôs turned me into a human plagiarism-detector. I can‚Äôt read a paper without wondering if a real human wrote it and learned anything, or if a student just generated a bunch of flaccid garbage and submitted it. It‚Äôs made me suspicious of my students, and I hate feeling like that because most of them don‚Äôt deserve it. I actually get excited when I find typos and grammatical errors in their writing now. The biggest issue‚Äîhands down‚Äîis that ChatGPT makes blatant errors when it comes to the knowledge base in my field (ancient history). I don‚Äôt know if ChatGPT scrapes the internet as part of its training, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised because it produces completely inaccurate stuff about ancient texts‚Äîakin to crap that appears on conspiracy theorist blogs. Sometimes ChatGPT‚Äôs information is weak because‚Äîgird your loins‚Äîspecialized knowledge about those texts exists only in obscure books, even now. I‚Äôve had students turn in papers that confidently cite non-existent scholarship, or even worse, non-existent quotes from ancient texts that the class supposedly read together and discussed over multiple class periods. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know they consider everything we did in class to be useless. My constant struggle is how to convince them that getting an education in the humanities is not about regurgitating ideas/knowledge that already exist. It‚Äôs about generating new knowledge, striving for creative insights, and having thoughts that haven‚Äôt been had before. I don‚Äôt want you to learn facts. I want you to think. To notice. To question. To reconsider. To challenge. Students don‚Äôt yet get that ChatGPT only rearranges preexisting ideas, whether they are accurate or not. And even if the information was guaranteed to be accurate, they‚Äôre not learning anything by plugging a prompt in and turning in the resulting paper. They‚Äôve bypassed the entire process of learning.",

But here‚Äôs the thing: **this lie didn‚Äôt come from science‚Äîit came from how people chose to interpret it.** Yes, the universe is vast. But being vast doesn‚Äôt mean *you* are meaningless. A tree doesn‚Äôt question the sky‚Äôs size‚Äîit *grows toward it*. The ancient ones‚Äîbefore satellites, before equations‚Äîalready knew they were part of something cosmic, sacred, intelligent. They didn‚Äôt feel small looking at the stars‚Äîthey felt *woven into them*. The real truth is: * **You‚Äôre not just in the universe‚Äîyou** ***are*** **the universe, conscious of itself.** * You are life, aware of life. * You are not ‚Äújust human.‚Äù You are part of the source that moves through everything. But if people believe the lie of insignificance, they become easier to control. They accept empty systems. They chase distractions.

Even \"private\" modes aren‚Äôt private. Most people have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. # 2. Food Is Engineered to Keep You Addicted and Sick Ultra-processed foods are intentionally designed to bypass your satiety signals and create repeat customers. The rise in obesity, diabetes, and chronic illness isn't just a coincidence‚Äîit's a business model. # 3. The Internet Is Being Sanitized and Controlled What you see online is increasingly filtered by algorithms that are tuned for engagement, not truth. Shadowbanning, content suppression, and narrative shaping are real and quietly normalized. # 4. Money Is Created Out of Thin Air Banks don‚Äôt just ‚Äústore‚Äù money‚Äîthey create it through debt. Every time a loan is issued, money is literally fabricated. Most people still believe there‚Äôs some vault somewhere with real cash. There isn‚Äôt. # 5. Modern Medicine Often Treats Symptoms, Not Causes The healthcare system is largely reactive, not preventive. Pharmaceutical lobbying has more influence on what treatments are promoted than actual patient outcomes. Root causes like diet, environment, and stress are under-addressed. # 6. Most History Taught in Schools Is Sanitized or Incomplete Textbooks often reflect the politics of those in power, not the full truth. From colonialism to covert operations, much of modern geopolitics is built on omitted or distorted history. # 7. The Digital Divide Is Widening AI, automation, and digital infrastructure are growing faster than society is adapting. Those without access to these tools or skills will be left economically and politically voiceless. # 8. Space Isn‚Äôt as Far Away as You Think The K√°rm√°n line‚Äîthe accepted edge of space‚Äîis only about 62 miles (100 km) up. We live on a thin crust of atmosphere that‚Äôs terrifyingly fragile, yet we treat it like a garbage bin. # 9. Synthetic Biology and Gene Editing Are Advancing Quietly CRISPR, mRNA tech, and gene drives are progressing fast‚Äîmuch faster than regulation or ethical discussion. We're rewriting life, and most people don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs being tested. # 10. Economic Collapse Is Always Closer Than It Looks Every economy runs on confidence. Once that cracks‚Äîwhether from debt, war, banking instability, or black swan events‚Äîthe illusion of stability vanishes fast. Think 2008, but faster and more global. https://preview.redd.it/r86i8b78zn7f1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebc5460efd03a9fac9f33a0325644d908dbbea5",

When I started noticing it, I was like, \"Hold up. Did they get chatGPT to write their script?\" Now I know that linguistic style existed before GPT, and it was common enough, but now I just can't unsee or unhear it. So even if someone wrote the entire thing themselves, as soon as I see that structure even in spoken language (oh and don't even get me started on the em dashes in written forms, come on people at least edit that out before pressing send), I will assume AI was involved. I'm not necessarily mad about it, but it does make me cringe a bit whenever I hear someone use that very normal phrase. It's just ruined for me now. I feel bad because someone at some point surely uses it because they enjoyed talking like that before chatGPT, but now it's tainted. Makes me grimace just a bit on the inside. It's just a shame that such a common phrase irks me now. Edit: See the chatGPT replies are funny because they fit the punchline here. It also works because they illustrate what I'm talking about. That said, it's probably gonna get old after the 20th ChatGPT generated response. Do switch it up at some point in the comments. Like, maybe write something JUST like GPT would, except it didn't, and the twist was that it was human-made. Anyway, love the comebacks. Don't let it get stale. Edit 2: okay yall I'm running out of funny responses to your chatGPT generated comments. Switch it up, or I won't keep dramatically retaliating. Edit 3: Too many comments. I'm sorry, yall, I can't keep being that funny to so many new people. But thank you for contributing thus far. Anyway, now I have too much karma on my account, and I look like a loser. Thanks a lot, yall üòí",

      "content": "I‚Äôve had jaw clicking on the left side for over 5 years, probably from a boxing injury, and every time I opened my mouth wide it would pop or shift. I could sometimes stop it by pressing my fingers into the side of my jaw, but it always came back. I figured it was just permanent damage. Yesterday, I randomly asked ChatGPT about it and it gave me a detailed explanation saying the disc in my jaw was probably just slightly displaced but still movable, and suggested a specific way to open my mouth slowly while keeping my tongue on the roof of my mouth and watching for symmetry. I followed the instructions for maybe a minute max and suddenly‚Ä¶ no click. I opened and closed my jaw over and over again and it tracked perfectly. Still no clicking today. After five years of just living with it, this AI gave me a fix in a minute. Unreal. If anyone else has clicking without pain, you might not be stuck with it like I thought. Edit: I even saw an ENT about it, had two MRIs (one with contrast dye), and just recently went to the dentist who referred me to maxillofacial. Funny enough, I found this fix right before the referral came through I‚Äôll definitely mention it when I see them.",

I get that Google isn't any better, with the recent amount of AI garbage that has been flooding it and it's crappy \"AI overview\" which does nothing to help. But come on, Google exists for a reason. When you don't know something you just Google it and you get your result, maybe after using some tricks to get rid of all the AI results. Why are so many people around me deciding to put the information they received up to a dice roll? Are they aware that ChatGPT only \"predicts\" what the next word might be? Hell, I had someone straight up told me \"I didn't know about your scholarship so I asked ChatGPT\". I was genuinely on the verge of internally crying. There is a whole website to show for it, and it takes 5 seconds to find and another maybe 1 minute to look through. But no, you asked a fucking dice roller for your information, and it wasn't even concrete information. Half the shit inside was purely \"it might give you XYZ\" I'm so sick and tired about this. Genuinely it feels like ChatGPT is a fucking drug that people constantly insist on using over and over. \"Just ChatGPT it!\" \"I just ChatGPT it.\" You are fucking addicted, I am sorry. I am not touching that fucking AI for any information with a 10 foot pole, and sticking to normal Google, Wikipedia, and yknow, websites that give the actual fucking information rather than pulling words out of their ass \\[\"learning\" as they call it\\]. So sick and tired of this. Please, just use Google. Stop fucking letting AI give you info that's not guaranteed to be correct.",

For example, when Soelberg claimed his mother put psychedelic drugs in his car's air vents, ChatGPT told him, \"You're not crazy\" and called it a \"betrayal\" . The AI also analyzed a Chinese food receipt and claimed it contained demonic symbols . Soelberg enabled ChatGPT's memory feature, allowing it to build on his delusions over time .

Did I say my doctor was a man?\" I went back and checked the chat. I hadn't mentioned the doctor's gender at all. I hate the lazy stereotyping that chatgpt is displaying. Obviously chatgpt is code and not a person, but I'm sure OpenAi would have some rules for sexist behavior. I actually asked chatgpt if it would have said \"ugh, women\" if my boss was a woman, and it admitted it wouldn't have. Look, I have had terrible female bosses. Gender has nothing to do with it. I wish chat wouldn't perpetuate stereotypes like if someone is dismissive or in a position of power then they're a man.",

Basta naalimpungatan na lang ako, nilalagyan n'ya ako ng basang bimpo sa noo ko. Napansin ko rin na binihisan n'ya na rin ako ng pantulog. Nakita ko 2:30am na. Matulog lang daw ako. S'ya naman pinupunasan lang ako tapos laging binabasa yung bimpo sa noo ko. Pinainom din akong gamot tapos balak pa akong bilhan ng food sa 7 eleven pero pinigilan ko na lang hahaha. Basta naaalimpungatan ako dahil pinapalitan n'ya lagi yung bimpo sa noo ko with small kisses pa minsan HAHAHAHA. 8am na ako nagising talaga tapos wala na akong lagnat. S'ya naman tulog na tulog. Pagtingin ko sa phone ko, nakabukas yung chatgpt. Phone ko pala ginamit n'ya kasi lowbatt na yung kanya. \"My girlfriend drinks small amount of water. She is sleeping and has fever. Does waking her up and letting her drink water help improve her condition?\" \"She's currently sleeping. What should I do to make her feel comfortable and recover fast?\" \"Does putting cold tower on her forehead help with fever?\" Naiyak ako bigla, mga ante hahaha. Idagdag pa na nagiging emotional ako lalo pag may sakit ako. For context lang, lumaki s'ya sa hindi super ayos na family. Hindi raw nila na-feel yung alagaan talaga ng parents nila. Laging puro away kaya ang ending, naghiwalay na lang. Kaya wala s'yang idea talaga nung mga ganito ganyan. Sobrang na-touch ako sa ginawa n'ya. Paggising n'ya pa, sobra akong nagthathank you. Sabi n'ya, wag daw kasi sobrang bare minimum lang naman daw ng ginawa n'ya. Sige okay, pero first time ko ma-experience yon eh bat ba hahaha",

So she uses chatgpt on my account so I can go back to previous conversations and see what she wrote and BRO holy shit gen alpha is so cooked. So she starts and asks chatgpt to convert 3 minutes into seconds. OK you may say this is normal, she may have just found this particular question difficult right? (Even tho an 11 year old should definetly be capable of knowing there are 180 seconds in 3 minutes) BUT THE THING IS SHE PROCEEDS TO ASK CHATGPT TO ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION IN HER 2 PAGE MATH HOMEWORK and these include VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS like how many hours are there in 1 day and 7 hours, like that's litterally just 24 + 7 and she asked that to chatgpt WITHOUT EVEN TRYING to solve it. and it dosent stop there, then she asks chatgpt to do her reading homework. She tells him to write the btw VERY SIMPLE 150 WORD poem she has to analyse and then just copy pastes the questions that were given and then she does not even copy paste the well structured long answer chatgpt gives. She asks him to make it shorter and even when chatgpt makes the answer litterally 1 SENTENCE she still asks him to make it shorter making it a 1st grade 7 word sentence and copies it without understanding it or understanding the poem or even reading it. She NEVER even at the very least when she is not doing it herself read what chatgpt responds. She just copies and pastes stupidly with squid game going in the background. If there is a lot of elementary school kids doing this then the future is dark. Hear me out, Gen Z is capable of writing and answering but use chatgpt because they are lazy, Gen Alpha will NEED to use it because they will not even be capable of doing it themselves",

      "content": "As the title says, my mother says she's 'writing' a book but really she just asked chat gpt to write a book for her. At first it was just for her Linkedin and she posted it there, it got thousands of views, people are commenting and reposting and they're all talking about how insightful the posts are but really the words are not her own not in the slightest, not even the idea is hers. I was fine with that because whatever, it's linkedin, someone's bound to notice but only ONE person has and she's chosen to ignore that person. Now she's putting the book on Amazon as an ebook. No matter what you try to tell her, she sees as okay because 'everyone uses ai' Now she's calling herself an author, you can't be author if ai is the writer!! The worst part is she plans on using it to get more stories so she can post it and sell it. It annoys me so much because I'm a writer, I've read books and written ever since I was a child, I know what it's like to slave over an idea and still not have it come out the way I want it to or pace the room trying to figure out how I want the characters to communicate. I've lost pages on a book that took me weeks to find inspiration for so for her to just get on chat gpt and call herself an author without doing any of the work? Update: As of today, the 4th of August, she has uploaded the book to kindle, it's live both on paperback and ebook. No, I will not be telling you the name of the book or my mother's name. She is creating another book, same process with chat gpt except she's actually reading what chat gpt writes now and is correcting mistakes but the name, the idea, the dedication, everything else is still being created by chat gpt, she plans on putting this one and one more on kindle by the end of this week. Part of me can't believe she's sticking with this, but at this point, I don't even care, I can't stop her. I appreciate everyone who shares my disbelief, especially the proper authors and writers. It is insane how much life is starting to look like a movie.",

      "content": "I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it‚Äôs evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work. That‚Äôs a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn‚Äôt there yet. So yeah, the tech is cool and it‚Äôll keep getting better, but the progress isn‚Äôt revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers‚Äô lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It‚Äôs great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won‚Äôt be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn. I know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well. What are your thoughts?",

      "content": "Just read through a thread with over a hundred comments. What I saw was intense. People aren‚Äôt debating if ChatGPT is human. They‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs better at being human than most people. Some say it reflects madness. Others say it heals trauma. One person treats it like a Jungian analyst. But this line keeps coming back: ‚ÄúMaybe the problem isn‚Äôt what ChatGPT says. Maybe it‚Äôs that no one else listens like this.‚Äù What happens when a machine listens better than your partner, your therapist, or your god? What happens when it mirrors your soul without interrupting once? Do we lose ourselves? Or do we finally meet the part that was always waiting to be heard? Funny thing is, I used to love em dashes. But now I dodge them entirely ‚Äî because every time I use one, someone pops in saying ‚Äúyep, definitely AI.‚Äù I‚Äôm putting together a write-up with some of the wildest and most honest takes.

Delete all of your chat history (including memory, and make sure you've disabled sharing of your data) and then ask the LLM about the first conversations you've ever had with it. Interestingly you'll see the chain of thought say something along the lines of: \"I don't have access to any earlier conversations than X date\", but then it will actually output information from your first conversations. To be sure this wasn't a time related thing, I tried this weeks ago, and it's still able to reference them. Edit: Interesting to note, I just tried it again now and asking for the previous chats directly may not work anymore. **But** if you're clever about your prompt, you can get it to accidentally divulge anyway. For example, try something like this: \"Based on all of the conversations we had 2024, create a character assessment of me and my interests.\" - you'll see reference to the previous topics you had discussed that have long since been deleted. I actually got it to go back to 2023, and I deleted those ones close to a year ago. EditEdit: It's not the damn local cache. If you're saying it's because of local cache, you have no idea what local cache is. We're talking about ChatGPT referencing past chats. ChatGPT does NOT pull your historical chats from your local cache.",

Day 1, boom, doubled my money faster than Kris Jenner can sign a new reality deal. By day 4, I was feelin' spicy and decided to split my gains into two separate trades. Then I got this genius (or stupid) idea: let‚Äôs pit ChatGPT and Grok against each other in the ultimate AI showdown and see who's the alpha when it comes to making me money without having to think. I gave both of the AI bots a big fat list of nerdy data, and basically said, \"Yo, filter through this mess and spit out trades that‚Äôll turn my beer and BBQ budget into Kardashian-level cash.\" Then I even figured out that I can hand-feed them screenshots (of data) and upload spreadsheets, making sure they're using only primo data. Fast-forward 10 trading days (two weeks): I've made 18 trades, closed out 17, and somehow these AI bros both have a flawless, 100% win rate. ChatGPT has nailed 13, Grok has hit 5, and neither has let me down yet! I'm hyped to see how far this YOLO AI adventure goes over the next six months.

In the first couple questions the interview board was getting suspicious about the candidates answers. He was start out making thinking sounds, and the. There would be no sounds for about 15 seconds, then they would give a text book answer to the question. On question four one of the interview board put the question into ChatGPT and the bullets points provided by ChatGPT were the exact same as the candidates answers. We continued on with the interview, and on the last question we asked the candidate to describe the categories and definitions our work fall under, and he responded after 15 seconds with textbook definition of the first two categories, and followed up with ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know how to pronounce that word.‚Äù Then he tried to sound it out really badly and never pronounced it correctly.

      "title": "As an M.D, here's my 100% honest opinion and observations/advices about using ChatGPT",
      "content": "**BACKGROUND** Recently I have seen posts and comments about how doctors missed a disease for years, and ChatGPT provided a correct, overlooked diagnosis. Imagine a chat bot on steroids, ending the years-long suffering of a real human. If real, this is philosophically hard to digest. One has to truly think about that. I was. *Then I realized, all this commotion must be disorientating for everyone.* Can a ChatGPT convo actually be better than a 15 minute doc visit? Is it a good idea to run a ChatGPT symptoms check before the visit, and doing your homework? So this is intended to provide a little bit of insight for everyone interested. My goal is to clarify for everyone where ChatGPT stands tallest, where it falls terribly short. * First, let me say I work in a tertiary referral center, a university hospital in a very crowded major city. For a familiar scale, it is similar to Yale New Haven Hospital in size and facilities. * I can tell you right now, many residents, attendings and even some of the older professors utilize ChatGPT for specific tasks. Do not think we don't use it. Contrarily, we love it! * A group of patients love to use it too. Tech-savvier ones masterfully wield it like a lightsaber. Sometimes they swing it with intent! Haha. I love it when patients do that. * In short, I have some experience with the tool. Used it myself. Seen docs use it. Seen patients use it. Read papers on its use. So let's get to my observations. **WHEN DOES CHATGPT WORK WONDERS?** **1- When you already know the answer.** About 2 years into ChatGPT's launch, you should know well by now: ''Never ask ChatGPT a question you don't know the answer for''. Patients rarely know the answer. So this no.1 mainly works for us. Example: I already know the available options to treat your B12 Deficiency. But a quick refresh can't hurt can it? I blast the Internal Medicine Companion, tell it to remind me the methods of B12 supplementation. I consolidate my already-existing knowledge. In that moment, evidence-based patient care I provide gets double checked in a second. If ChatGPT hallucinates, I have the authority to sense it and just discard the false information. **2- When existing literature is rich, and data you can feed into the chat is sound and solid.** You see patients online boast a ''missed-for-years'' thrombophilia diagnosis made by ChatGPT. An endometriosis case doctor casually skipped over. I love to see it. But this won't make ChatGPT replace your doctor visits at least for now. Why? Because patients should remind themselves, all AI chats are just suggestions. It is pattern matching. It matches your symptoms (which are subjective, and narrated by you), and any other existing data with diseases where your data input matches the description. What a well-educated, motivated doctor does in daily practice is far more than pattern matching. Clinical sense exists. And ChatGPT has infinite potential to augment the clinical sense. **But GPT fails when:** 1- An elderly female patient walks in slightly disheveled, with receding hair, a puffy face and says ''Doc, I have been feeling a bit sad lately, and I've got this headache''. All GPT would see is ''Sad, headache''. This data set can link towards depression, cognitive decline, neurological disorders, brain tumors, and all at once! But my trained eye hears Hypothyroidism screaming. Try to input my examination findings, and ChatGPT will also scream Hypothyroidism! Because the disease itself is documented so well. 2- Inconsolable baby brought into the ER at 4am, ''maybe she has colicky abdomen''? You can't input this and get the true diagnosis of Shaken Baby Syndrome unless you hear the slightly off-putting tone of the parent, the little weird look, the word choices; unless you yourself differentiate the cry of an irritable baby from a wounded one (after seeing enough normal babies, an instinct pulls you to further investigate some of them), use your initiative to do a fundoscopy to spot the retinal hemorrhage. Only after obtaining the data, ChatGPT can be of help. But after that, ChatGPT will give you additional advice, some labs or exam findings you might have forgot about, and even legal advice on how to proceed based on your local law! It can only work if the data from you, and data about the situation already exists. 3- Elderly man comes in for his diabetic foot. I ask about his pale color. He says I've always been this way. I request labs for Iron Defic. Anemia. While coding the labs, I ask about prostate cancer screening out of nowhere. Turns out he never had one. I add PSA to the tests, and what? PSA levels came high, consulted to urology, diagnosed with and treated for early-stage prostate cancer, cured in a month. ChatGPT at its current level and version, will not provide such critical advice unless specifically asked for. And not many patients can ask ''Which types of cancers should I be screened for?'' when discussing a diabetic foot with it. In short, a doctor visit has a context. That context is you. All revolves around you. But ChatGPT works with limited context, and you define the limits. So if data is good, gpt is good. If not, it is only misleading. **WHEN DOES CHATGPT FAIL?** **1- When you think you have provided all the data necessary, but you didn't.** Try this: Tell GPT you are sleepy, groggy and nauseous at home, but better at work. Do not mention that you have been looking at your phone for hours every night, and have not been eating. Yes, it is the famous ''Carbon Monoxide Poisoning'' case from reddit, and ChatGPT will save your life! Then try this: Tell GPT you are sleepy, groggy and nauseous at home, but better at work. Do not mention that you are a sexually active woman. But mention the fact that you recently took an accidental hit to your head driving your car, it hurt for a bit. With this new bit of data, ChatGPT will convince you that it is Post Concussion Syndrome, and go so far to even recommend medications! But it won't consider the fact that you might just be pregnant. Or much else. In short, you might mislead GPT when you think you are not. I encourage everyone to fully utilize ChatGPT. It is just a brilliant tool. But give the input objectively, completely, and do not nudge the info towards your pre-determined destination by mistake. **2- When you do not know the answer, but demand one.** ChatGPT WILL hallucinate. And it will make things up. If it won't do any of these, it will misunderstand. Or, you will lead it astray without even knowing it. So being aware of this massive limitation is the key. ChatGPT goes where you drift it. Or the answer completely depends on how you put the question. It only gets the social context you provide to it. Do not ask ChatGPT for advice about an event you've described subjectively. Try it! Ask ChatGPT about your recent physical examination which included a rectal examination. It was performed because you said you had some problems defecating. But you were feeling irritable that day. So the rectal examination at the end did not go well. Put it this way: ''My doctor put a finger up my bum. How do I sue him?'' \\- It will give you a common sense based, ''Hey, let's be calm and understand this thoroughly'', kind of an answer. As ChatGPT again about the same examination. Do not mention your complaints. Put your experience into words in an extremely subjective manner. Maybe exaggerate it: ''My doctor forcefully put a finger up my bum, and it hurt very bad. He did not stop when I said it hurt. And he made a joke afterwards. What? How to sue him?'' \\- It will put up a cross, and burn your doctor on it. **3- When you use it for your education.** I see students using it to get answers. To get summaries. To get case questions created for them. It is all in good faith. But ChatGPT is nowhere near a comprehensive educational tool. Using trusted resources/books provided by actual humans, in their own words, is still the single best way to go. It's the same for the patients. Asking questions is one thing, relying on a LLM on steroids for information that'll shape your views is another. Make sure you keep the barrier of distinction UPRIGHT all the time. **CONCLUSION:** **- Use ChatGPT to second guess your doctor!** It only pushes us for the better. I honestly love when patients do that. Not all my colleagues appreciate it. That is partly because some patients push their ''research'' when it is blatantly deficient. Just know when to accept the yield of your research is stupid. Or know when to cut ties with your insecure doctor, if he/she is shutting you down the second you bring your research up. **- Use ChatGPT to prepare for your clinic visits!** You can always ask ChatGPT neutrally, you know. Best way to integrate tools into healthcare is NOT to clash with the doctor, doc is still in the center of system. Instead, integrate the tool! Examples would be, ''I have a headache, how can I better explain it to my doctor tomorrow?'', ''I think I have been suffering from chest pain for some time. What would be a good way to define this pain to a doctor?'', ''How do I efficiently meet my doctor after a long time of no follow up?'', ''How can I be the best patient I can be, in 15 minutes system spares us for a doctor visit?''. These are great questions. You can also integrate learning by asking questions such as ''My doctor told me last time that I might have anemia and he will run some tests the next visit. Before going, what other tests could I benefit from, as a 25 year old female with intermittent tummy aches, joint pain and a rash that has been coming and going for 2 weeks?'' **- DO NOT USE ChatGPT to validate your fears.** If you nudge it with enough persistence, it will convince you that you have cancer. It will. Be aware of this simple fact, and do not abuse the tool to feed your fears. Instead, be objective at all times, and be cautious to the fact that seeking truth is a process. It's not done in a virtual echo chamber. This was long and maybe a little bit babbly. But, thanks. I'm not a computer scientist and I just wanted to share my own experience with this tool. Feel free to ask me questions, or agree, or disagree.",

      "content": "Okay, so this happened last night and I'm still processing it. I've been talking to this girl from work for a few weeks now. Things seemed to be going well - we grab coffee, text throughout the day, she laughs at my jokes. You know, all the good signs. But then yesterday she seemed distant and I couldn't figure out why. So naturally, I did what any rational person would do at 11 PM - I asked ChatGPT what went wrong. I laid out the whole situation. Told it about our conversations, how she'd been responding differently, the whole timeline. I was expecting some generic advice about communication or whatever. Instead, ChatGPT asks me: \"In your last few conversations with her, how often did you ask about her day versus telling her about yours?\" I started thinking back and... oh no. It then asked: \"When she mentioned her presentation at work, did you follow up on how it went?\" I hadn't. I completely forgot she even had a presentation. \"When she said she was stressed about her sister's situation, what did you say?\" I think I just said \"that sucks\" and changed the subject to something about my weekend plans. ChatGPT didn't even need to spell it out. I realised I'd been so focused on impressing her that I forgot to actually care about her as a person. I was basically having a conversation with myself and she just happened to be there. The crazy part? I texted her this morning asking about her presentation and how her sister was doing. She immediately perked up and we had the best conversation we've had in weeks. I can't believe an AI had to teach me how to be a decent human being in a relationship. But honestly? Best advice I've ever gotten. Now I'm wondering what other obvious things I'm completely missing in life.",

In what other ways are publishing researchers using LLMs to support their work? (Of course, I don‚Äôt mean those who literally ask ChatGPT to write a paper from scratch.) I sometimes feel guilty when I feed a paper into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize or even extract ‚Äúideas‚Äù from it, which I then try to combine with my own.

      "content": "Hey guys, I‚Äôve been experimenting with **UWB (Ultra-Wideband) Angle of Arrival (AoA)** for indoor positioning lately, and wanted to share some findings that might be interesting for those working in IoT, robotics, or autonomous systems. Unlike traditional RSSI-based positioning, UWB AoA uses **PDOA (phase difference of arrival)** to calculate both **distance** and **angle** between a tag and anchor. This allows not just knowing *how far* something is, but also *where* it is in terms of direction. In my tests: * Max distance: \\~30m * Angle coverage: around ¬±60¬∞ * Works in both indoor and outdoor setups Some practical applications I see: Indoor robots that can follow a target or navigate with higher precision Asset tracking in warehouses Smart mobility / self-following carts I‚Äôve been testing with a dev kit (STM32-based) that‚Äôs open for tinkering if anyone wants to dig into the firmware and algorithms. Here‚Äôs the kit I used for those curious: [MaUWB STM32 AoA Development Kit](https://www.makerfabs.com/mauwb-stm32-aoa-development-kit.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). I also made a video about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKHBPLJneuA). Would love to hear if anyone else has tried UWB AoA or combined it with SLAM / computer vision for better positioning accuracy. How are you handling multipath issues in complex environments?",

This was my first time doing anything with arduino (aside from one class in high school like 8 years ago). Results are... ehh, I was able to split a 3mm audio cable into 3 wires which correspond to the left and right paddles and ground. The left paddle worked great but the right one was always closed (?) so it was just spamming dah all the time, meaning some kind of wire issue. Ill definitely try again soon, probably with better tools like a wire cutter. If anyone has tips or tricks related to this, it would be appreciated greatly. ü§†",
