          "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about IoT (Internet of Things) and whether it still has a promising future for starting a business. During the COVID-19 era, we saw a wave of IoT companies and products gain traction. Things like temperature sensors, smart health monitors, and gadgets from companies like Xiaomi made it seem like IoT was about to explode. Now it feels like the buzz has died down. We don\u2019t hear much about new smart gadgets anymore. For example, why would anyone still need a temperature sensor? And even if they do, aren\u2019t there already more than enough in the market? So my question is: 1. Do you think IoT is still a viable field for building a business? 2. Or has the market become oversaturated and stagnant? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, especially from people in the industry or who follow tech trends closely.",

Any theories, laws etc. or should i learn about sensors first? I made a traffic light mini project with three LEDs, a OLED screen and a button. I am currently just studying from datasheets and chatgpt, are there any youtube channels, blogs, communities dedicated to IoT like this sub reddit? Any help is much appreciated.",

          "content": "Hi. I am looking for some advise for what I should do next in my career. I have a degree in Computer Science and Engineering degree from a state university. Currently, I have been an IoT engineer for my current company for about a year now. Before that, I was an IoT engineer for about 3 years. So, 4 years in total. Before that, I was a backend engineer for about 12 years, which includes the IoT roles. For both of these companies, I have built IoT and backend solutions using an MQTT broker to communicate to and from IoT devices. Plus, any of the other necessary solutions that are required to make those IoT devices work correctly in a production environment. This is where I want some advice in my career. I am currently thinking about going back to school for a Electrical Engineering degree simply because I noticed that I really enjoy working with physical, tangible devices. And mainly, I am just curious about building hardware IoT devices. So I figured why not build the devices themselves since I already have the software background for them? And I've been doing hardware related projects since college. I built drones, esp32 projects, etc. I have always wanted to really understand what goes into building a PCB. So my question is, is this something someone has done? Is this something that would be a good idea? Do companies hire individuals who have both a hardware and software background for IoT or robotics? What do you guys think? Thanks in advance.",

Next semester it will be time for our placements and I have, what i find a difficult choice to make: To whether stay true and continue to only go for jobs that involves IoT or choose something mainstream. I love working with IoT , Sensors, Robotics, Cloud and anything that's related to actual hardware and getting my hands dirty. But My seniors and some friends in the industry often say different things about the potential and growth of IoT compared to that of AI , Data Science , etc. Though I'm not the type to go after money first, I'm still compelled to take the decision that can give me a bright future. So.. i want to ask those experienced and working here in this sub about what i should look out for and how i should go about it , as , if i go mainstream, as far as i know, = quick money + more oppurtunities + optional post graduation degree , but if i go with IoT = maybe slow money + less opputunities + i will have to do a PG degree as soon as possible, which is a bit of a financial burden on my family. please help me make this decision, and i would appreciate if you gave me a an idea of what i should master if i do end up choosing IoT as my career. TL;DR: I'm in my 3rd year of [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in CSE with IoT and Automation specialization and are unsure whether to pursue a career in IoT or opt for mainstream fields like AI or Data Science. I love working with hardware and IoT but am concerned about IoT's growth and earning potential compared to AI and Data Science. While I'm not focused on money, I'm thinking about future opportunities and the need for a post-graduation degree if I do end up going for IoT.",

          "content": "Hello, Reddit! We are cybersecurity researchers who wrote a book called [Practical IoT Hacking](https://practical-iot-hacking.com) that teaches readers how to hack Internet of Things devices safely and lawfully, with practical hands on examples and proven methodologies. You can buy physical and Kindle copies through [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-IoT-Hacking-Fotios-Chantzis/dp/1718500904) or get the physical copy and DRM-free digital copy through the publisher [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/practical-iot-hacking). We have spent our careers addressing critical issues in IoT devices that could lead to loss of life or privacy breaches. Our work has influenced people around the world, including manufacturers, hospitals, and public policymakers. We believe that enabling more people to find unforeseen risks in a safe manner and report them in good faith can inoculate against accidents and adversaries causing harm. So we wrote a book to teach others who want to be a part of the solution. We believe that societal dependence on connected technology is growing faster than our ability to secure it. As we adopt technology stacks in the works around us, we inadvertently import cybersecurity risks that can impact human life, public safety, and national security. By understanding the threat and vulnerability components of these risks, we can defend against them. Mature manufacturers seek to learn from cybersecurity researchers and take reports of flaws they discover - so they can eliminate them in current and future products.

The BB QNX is the only certified software running on connected and autonomous cars (70% of market)... [here is proof](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-adds-another-certification-to-its-embedded-software-portfolio-301165498.html) As you can see there is something going on with blackberry stock. Based on this comparison analysis it's a **massively undervalued** company that's leading charge in EV, iot, connected cars, ai cybersecurity. Rest of these companies only provide a small component of Unified Endpoint Security (UES), only Blackberry provides all components you need for **UES (next gen security architecture)!**! Meaning, an enterprise or government only needs to use a single platform **blackberry spark** to enable UES across their network of iot (computer, laptop, servers, phones, drones, cars, etc). The other companies only provide small part of UES, so it's more expensive for enterprise to go with other companies because then they have to deal with multiple companies to enable UES. Example, crowdstrike only provides Cybersecurity and does not provide Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Car operating system. **To enabled smart and connected future you need UES, UEM, Car Operating system and ai security and only blackberry has all these under a single platform!!!!** **Blackberry Spark has UES and UEM**. No other companies listed in this table provides both solution. Blackberry leads in car security and operating system...none of these other companies have car software. Blackbery owns 70% of ai cybersecurity patents and has the most advanced and mature machine learning model. the model prevents cyber attacks before they happen...meaning it prevents the attack from executing!! All together blackberry has **40,000 patents**!! So at this moment the company's leadership in EV and iot and cybersecurity should value it around 70-80 Billion or at MINIMUM $140 a stock!! This is just my analysis and DD. Please invest after doing your own DD. This is not a financial advice. **Wish you all apes Godspeed**!!! you all have found a true diamond!!",

          "title": "Spent thousands on UniFi gear \u2014 support says my IoT devices are overloading the APs? Is this reasonable?",
          "content": "Hey all, I\u2019ve invested heavily in UniFi gear for my single-family home \u2014 well over \u20ac3,000 into a near-pro-level setup: * 5 access points (U6 LR, U6 Mesh, U7 Outdoor) * Dream Machine Pro * PoE Pro switches * All connected via CAT6e, fully wired, all defaults (no weird config) Recently I\u2019ve been having terrible WiFi issues. Packet loss, unstable throughput, massive variability on speed tests. Ethernet is flawless (900 Mbps+), but WiFi just breaks randomly \u2014 even 3m from a ceiling-mounted AP. I contacted UniFi support, ran all the diagnostics, sent them logs, Airtime scans, etc. Then I received this explanation: &gt;\u201cWe reviewed the support file and observed high channel utilization on multiple access points: &gt;U6 LR (5GHz): 17 IoT devices connected \u2014 suggested to redistribute them &gt;U7 Outdoor (2.4GHz): high utilization &gt;U6 Mesh (2.4GHz): 14 IoT devices &gt;U6 LR (2.4GHz): 15 IoT devices\u201d Then they told me to \"balance the load across APs and channels\" to reduce interference... **My question to the community:** How is it that a few dozen **tiny IoT devices**, most of which send a few bytes of data now and then, can *congest* APs that \u2014 per UniFi\u2019s own specs \u2014 are rated to handle **250\u2013400+ clients** each? This isn\u2019t an apartment building. It\u2019s one house with some smart plugs, HomeKit sensors, and a couple phones and laptops. If this is enough to crash or choke the system, is something seriously wrong with the firmware/configuration? Or are UniFi APs just massively over-advertised? Has anyone else run into this or am I missing something obvious? Appreciate any real-world advice or input. I really want to love this system, but right now it feels like I\u2019m fighting it more than using it. **Edit:** Thanks for all the great input \u2014 seriously one of the most helpful threads I\u2019ve posted. To summarize some common themes I\u2019ve seen (and replied to) that might help others: 1. Here are some **screenshots** I've been uploading in this thread [https://imgur.com/a/mctynBs](https://imgur.com/a/mctynBs) 2. **I do have a separate SSID and VLAN for IoT** \u2014 2.4 GHz-only, WPA2, isolated IP range. I\u2019ve repeated this a few times in comments because people kept missing it \ud83d\ude05 3. **No 6 GHz support in my setup** \u2014 None of my APs (U6 LR, U6 Mesh, U7 Outdoor) have 6 GHz radios. Some advice around 6 GHz didn\u2019t apply here, but it\u2019s good context for others reading. 4. **Multicast storm from a robot lawnmower** \u2014 turned out to be a major clue. One AP showed nearly 100% multicast utilization 24/7. So yes, chatty devices can saturate airtime even if they don\u2019t use much actual data. 5. **Meshing was silently enabled** \u2014 even though all APs are wired. I\u2019ve now disabled the \"Meshing Parent\" and \"Connect\" settings, as suggested. 6. **Channel width and DFS:** I\u2019ve switched to 20 MHz on 2.4 GHz and am experimenting with 80 MHz on 5 GHz. I\u2019ve also enabled DFS channels after multiple people pointed out they\u2019re safe and useful in residential setups. 7. **TX Power and RSSI:** Still tweaking these \u2014 not rushing changes blindly without proper tools, but planning to reduce TX power and possibly add min RSSI thresholds to prevent sticky client issues. 8. **Some AP models are problematic:** A few people called out the U6 LR specifically as having issues with mDNS and client stability \u2014 not something I expected, but worth testing. Again, big thanks to everyone contributing. I\u2019m continuing to test and update config, and I\u2019ll report back if I find anything breakthrough-level. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 **Edit:** **I think we found the solution** \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1lppl52/comment/n0zhyki/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1lppl52/comment/n0zhyki/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 **Final Edit: Confirmed \u2014 It Was mDNS** \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 After nearly 24 hours of additional testing, I can now confirm with 100% certainty that **mDNS was the root cause** of my issues. I toggled mDNS proxying on and off multiple times, and the difference was night and day \u2014 no doubt left. I have around **60 ESPHome devices**, which appear to be broadcasting constantly (note to self: check mDNS interval settings in firmware). Combine that with several **Apple devices** (Bonjour/mDNS-heavy), and it\u2019s no surprise the symptoms were worst there. Only the **U7 Outdoor** gives visibility into multicast utilization via the *Radios &gt; Airtime* graph \u2014 and it showed nearly **100% multicast airtime**. The U6 series doesn\u2019t expose this stat, but the U7 was clearly the canary: dropped pings, jittery latency (see [screenshot](https://imgur.com/o7NRSr8)), and general instability. If you\u2019ve got **60\u201370 devices** (TVs, Sonos, ESPHome, etc.) blasting mDNS \u2014 and UniFi APs are trying to **proxy that traffic between Main, IoT, and Guest VLANs** \u2014 it can *absolutely* overwhelm the system. I still want to retain some level of discovery across VLANs (e.g., casting, automation), but with **rate limiting or filtering**. My next step is to try deploying an **mDNS proxy in Docker** on my Synology NAS. It has dual Ethernet, so I\u2019ll bridge it to both VLANs and control things more surgically. Massive thanks again to everyone who contributed \u2014 this thread has been invaluable. Good luck to others debugging their setups \u2014 and **don\u2019t overlook mDNS**. It can *wreck* your network silently.",

          "content": "EDIT 6 Months later: I think it's fair to say these issue are resolved. If you still have issues, be sure to comment on the firmware releases in the Ubiquiti forums. I personally have switched to U7 XG models as the thermal design is much better. I no longer have any IoT issue (though i still never went back to Matter over WiFi). Original post: Wanted to collect a few items together for the benefit of everyone following along. Recap for those that need it: the U7 Pro and Pro Max have issues with 2.4Ghz IoT devices. The majority report devices 'ghost dropping' where they show in the controller, show as associated but don't pass any data. I found issues with the Matter protocol creating too much mDNS traffic that overloads (as in 100% channel utilization the AP, multi-second ping times) the AP, but the same system with a gen 5,6 AP won't show past 20% and won't have any issues. I recently downgraded all my light switches back to Homekit which solves that issue with less mDNS, but now i have what everyone else reports, the ghost dropping. u/digiblur has been able to [create a repeatable lab demonstration of the issue](https://community.ui.com/releases/UniFi-Access-Point-7-0-84/afbef858-2eac-41e7-a405-1d036ce379a1#comment/bd335a6c-d937-4d46-ad03-35becb044050) with 33 smart plugs. I can't say this enough, this is **not a configuration issue**, this is **not a user issue**. If the U7 works for you and your IoT, great. But there is a measurable amount of people it doesn't work for. Please don't try and tell us what we should be doing. In fact Ubiquiti tried adding a \"enhanced IoT mode\" in EA Network that forced all the settings we all knew we should be using to begin with. Didn't solve the issue. The last EA version has asked us to[ not use that mode anymore](https://community.ui.com/releases/UniFi-Access-Point-7-0-84/afbef858-2eac-41e7-a405-1d036ce379a1). At least for that build. Ubiquiti created [a thread to collect email address of those affected](https://community.ui.com/questions/U7-and-2-4GHz-IoT-devices/a8cbd7bc-0001-44cc-bd89-91c0313cf4e9) for working in email with customers on bug fixes. It has 125 comments. We have seen 10 EA versions released since that thread was made on the 7.0.x branch, none really fix the issue. Each release has 5-10 pages of comments of people all about this IoT issue. Ubiquiti has said [they have all their focus on fixing this](https://community.ui.com/releases/UniFi-Access-Point-7-0-84/afbef858-2eac-41e7-a405-1d036ce379a1#comment/c1114113-cd30-439f-bfd7-45601bfd600e) and implied this delays the 7.1 branch development (MLO and ZWDFS). At least that's what i take from the comment, but it's linked for you to read. Because i have (had) a special issue with having 50+ Matter products causing a IPv6 mDNS storm i did have direct contact with Ubiquiti for a bit through email They sent me some special builds and I sent them Wireshark 802.11 captures. No real fix and they haven't had me test anything since Oct 16th. I don't post this to bash on Ubiquiti (but i also think there is room for improvement) but to educated users and customers on the \"state of affairs\" with this access point generation by collating data that's spread over multiple forum posts and comments. The deeper issue now is we are about a month away from the year anniversary of the U7pro release. Anyone who has purchased a U7 from a distributor (or Amazon) only gets 1 year of warranty. That's about to happen. I would like to see Ubiquiti acknowledge the issues in the U7pro and U7pro max by extending everyones warranty to 2 years (like anyone who bought directly from the UI store already has). That would be a good show of faith in my opinion. Second, a no question asked exchange for a U6Pro would be nice as well for [those of us tired of waiting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1h32e71/comment/lznql2s/) In the mean time, I (we) are left with wives getting ever more frustrated when Alexa can't turn off the light, which happens alot with these APs. EDIT: Several people have reported their U7 InWall have the same issues for those asking.",

          "content": "I\u2019m a Monday-at-work WAN listener, and just heard Linus and Luke\u2019s (negative) opinion on the early Nest thermostats going EOL. I found their opinion a little surprising, especially after it was revealed that the EOL\u2019d thermostats didn\u2019t support modern cryptographic cyphers. I can\u2019t find any source for what that exactly means, but that makes it sound like Google is doing something responsible, and I think there\u2019s room for a more nuanced discussion about it. I suspect the fallout from the move they made was *substantially* less than the potential fallout from continuing to support devices that they KNEW were insecure until several high-severity CVEs (for example) were suddenly discovered and disclosed. My analogy isn\u2019t perfect, but I think it\u2019s kind of similar to if Nintendo still supported WFC on the DS today. It sucks that you can\u2019t play online on the DS anymore, BUT the DS also doesn\u2019t support any WiFi authentication protocol better than WEP. Giving customers any reason to run a WEP-\u201csecured\u201d WiFi network was already pretty irresponsible by 2014 (when WFC was turned off). I also think there\u2019s a general understanding that there eventually comes a point where a computer becomes too old to safely use or connect to your home network. I don\u2019t remember IoT marketing ever acknowledging that, but all those devices are fundamentally little baby \u201ccomputers\u201d (with many fewer functions) that have to interface with other software/hardware, that inevitably will develop security practices that are outside the scope of those old IoT devices. Obviously Google/pre-acquisition Nest didn\u2019t have a crystal ball to see those changes ahead of time, so there *is* a point in time where they\u2019re off the hook. When is that? Is 14 years not enough? Would this have been okay if they open-sourced the firmware for those devices? Are early IoT device manufacturers liable for failing to properly market that those devices were, by the nature of their design, not going to work forever?",

Only other companies that can be compared with Blackberry Ai cybersecurity is Crowdstrike and SentenialOne, both use Ai for cybersecurity BUT they both have older Ai engine that comes nowhere close to BB Ai engine. CRWD market cap : $60 Billion ($800 mm annual rev) SentenialOne market cap: $17 Billion ( $100 mm annual rev) BB Blackberry market cap: $6 Billion ($1billion annual rev) &amp;#x200B; BB is not just leader in cybersecurity protecting 500 million endpoints including 200 million connected cars on the road but they are also providing the foundation for iot platform, QNX secure operating system. The QNX runs the entire medical device industry, drones, and controls over 78% of Ev connected car market. QNX is kinda monopoly with a HUGE moat because it has BB Ai engine embedded to prevent hacks and ransomeware and viruses. &amp;#x200B; I'm happy that WSB crowd and Apes are holding and brining much needed attention to this stock. This stock was being kicked around by analyst on purpose in hope that the company would go under 5 years ago so they can come buy patents and parts for cheap. &amp;#x200B; BB holds over 42,000 patents and over 70% of cybersecurity ai patents!!!! They are selling of their old business patents like messaging, phones, networking wireless to likely Facebook. Once it's announced the stock should do 3-4x. Not a financial advice but please look into BB. It's not a phone company but a leader in cybersecurity!!! they run iot and cybersecurity world for banks, defense, drones, cars, etc!!",

Zigbee has devoted supporters but I\u2019m unsure if this will slowly wane as Matter etc take over. Zwave seems to be getting a few posts in here lately so maybe I should be considering that. I certainly don\u2019t want to be using wifi if I can help it for most of the many small simple devices around the house (switches, plugs, wall outlets, bulbs, etc). I\u2019m totally enamoured with how Lutron caseta light switches just always work. Always. I\u2019m unsure what they use but they set the standard for how I want everything else to work. I\u2019d like to pick a standard and start moving things to that as I refresh my IoT tech over the next year. I suspect others have mulled this themselves and may have reached their own conclusions, or perhaps it\u2019s timely to revisit this now for 2024. Opinions?",

I was wondering if I should go with windows 10 LTSC or 11 LTSC (iot is that one I heard was best) I read that the ltsc version of 11 doesn't come with any of the garbage that's forced on the other versions like the spyware recall, insane bloatware and built in adds and resource hogs. I was going to use the windows 10 one but unfortunate some features of my motherboard will be unusable due to a lack of drivers that support win10 but I guess I won't be too sad about missing out on WIFI. My build would be a 9950X3D with 96 GB of ram, I will install the OS on an HDD as I find it to be more reliable and shouldn't realistically require an SSD for the tasks it does. would windows 11 end up eating like 20% of my ram for no reason at all, will I be able to avoid all the bloat, spyware and downgrades from 10 ? If I go with 10 will a push myself in a corner due to how the LTSC branch tends to be janky with upgrades ( at least that is what I was told. I was told for windows 11 the IOT LTSC was the better of the LTSC versions due to less bloat and better performance, is that true? Sorry if the question is rather dumb Sadly linux isn't an option for me as some of the games I play still do not support it for some dumb reason. does windows still hate dual booting on shared physical drives ?",

Here\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck: * Are APIs basically just a way to transfer messages, like TCP/UDP already do? * If so, why not just use TCP or UDP directly? * I see frameworks like FastAPI, Django, Flask \u2014 do they all just implement REST under the hood? * Is an \u201cAPI\u201d just a concept, while the framework decides how it\u2019s actually implemented? For context: I\u2019m joining a hackathon soon, and I need to process an image on my machine (Python) and represent it on a webpage (frontend). I\u2019d love if someone could explain in beginner-friendly terms (with maybe a small example flow) how to structure this for a real-world project. Thanks in advance!",

Chefs often train under other successful chefs, then when they branch out, they openly respect and honour that lineage. It\u2019s part of their identity and even their brand: \u201cI trained under X.\u201d That got me thinking about other industries. In tech, IoT, mobile, and telecoms, we all know the big names\u2014Jobs, Gates, Musk\u2014but most of us never worked with them. The real mentors are often the quiet innovators, the first managers who pushed us, or even the people we only ever learned from online through posts, podcasts, or forums. So I\u2019m curious: \u2022 In your field, is it common to openly celebrate the people you learned from? \u2022 Do you see professional \u201clineage\u201d as a badge of credibility, or is it something kept private? \u2022 Who are the leaders, innovators, or even online voices in IoT/mobile/tech that you respect and still carry lessons from?

          "content": "Watmonitor is a webapp which I developed from time-to-time during last 2 years to nowadays look. Started as a university project. It works as a gateway, that allows you to receive and store data from a IoT sensor node that can be DIY hardware (ESP32, Arduino) based, or industrial-grade based. It has real-time overview page and then other pages, where you can see historical and statistics datas, such as: Maximum / minimum level measured per month, week, day. There is historical table that consist of all the data ever recorded, as admin you can delete exact measurement that you like. In graphs you can see the whole water level measured during different time periods. These line graphs can be download in .csv, .svg or .png format for further analysis or visualisation in 3rd party softwares. Watmonitor can be integrated to 3rd party systems directly using two JSON endpoints that are providing the latest data, or for a specific time period (from-to, or all from, or all to, or totally all). Working and tested with Node-RED, but also with Home Assistant. By integration you can get more notification features, or automatization for irrigation, home pump control etc. Watmonitor is translated to English, German, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, French language. There is available a online web interface of instance of Watmonitor, that you can test and use for free with your hardware based on Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266 (can't guarantee you will be only one writing the data, as is public interface). There are a lot of prototyping software and source codes available, including standard, but also low power or OTA modes. Possible to use ultrasonic distance sensors (JSN-SR04T, HC-SR04), or ToF laser sensors such as VL53L1X (TOF400C). Software available is for Arduino Core, but also for ESP-IDF framework with FreeRTOS and inter-task communication using Queues. Usable for absolute begineers, or more advanced users. There are some experiemntal implementations for LoRa (PPP), LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox LPWAN connectivity aswell. But as web interface is universal, can be used with any other sensor technology, or industrial bus, where you can configure and set the requeired HTTPS POST request pattern. Watmonitor is extended by QR scanner feature, that allows you to get the latest sensor data by scanning the QR code on device (usable for big installations with many sensor nodes), or there can be used also tailor-made AR (Augmented Reality) orbital visualisation with dashboard.",

When my boss asks me to integrate a new IoT device, I need to study the device\u2019s documentation to extract the relevant commands (mainly Modbus in my case, but I also work with other protocols). To streamline this process, I built a tool that uses AI to analyze the documentation for me. Initially, the responses weren\u2019t accurate, so I spent some time experimenting with RAG and prompt engineering. After analyzing and extracting the Modbus commands, the tool automatically sends the commands to the device for verification. Once the process is complete, it generates a library with device-specific functions that I can call, saving me the time of studying the documentation manually. I\u2019m now thinking about how AI can help me with other parts of my job. How do you guys use AI to improve your workflow as engineers? I\u2019d love to hear your experiences!",

Specifically, I\u2019m curious about: * **Career paths:** What are the main directions people usually take? For example: * **IIoT (Industrial IoT)** * **IoT embedded development (hardware + firmware)** * **Cloud/DevOps-focused IoT (infrastructure, pipelines, data, edge-cloud integration)** * **Field IoT / deployment &amp; integration** * **Job titles:** Since \u201cIoT Engineer\u201d or \u201cIoT Specialist\u201d isn\u2019t always the keyword, what titles should I actually search for? (System Integrator? Embedded Systems Engineer? Cloud Engineer? Solution Architect?) * **Applications:** What are the hottest or most promising fields for IoT in Europe? (Factories &amp; manufacturing, smart cities, agriculture, environmental monitoring, energy, space, healthcare, etc.) * **Salaries &amp; competitiveness:** How do IoT-related jobs compare to other IT fields (software dev, cloud, cybersecurity, data science) in terms of pay and career growth? * **Entry barrier:** Is IoT seen as a niche requiring very specific expertise, or can someone with a general IT/software background transition into it relatively smoothly? * **Regional hotspots:** Are there particular countries or cities in Europe where IoT is more active (Germany with IIoT? The Netherlands with smart cities? Northern Europe with sustainability? etc.) Basically, I\u2019d love to hear from people already working in the field about what the market really looks like, what kind of backgrounds are valued, and whether it\u2019s a good bet career-wise compared to other IT directions.

          "content": "Built voice control for our smart home devices that actually understands context and doesn't need wake words for everything. THE PROBLEM: Traditional IoT voice control is basically shouting commands at devices. \"Alexa, turn on living room lights.\" \"OK Google, set temperature to 72.\" It's functional but nobody wants to talk to their house like that constantly. WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS: Made the devices understand conversational context. Walk into a room and say \"too bright\" and it dims. Say \"actually a bit more\" and it adjusts. No wake words, no specific command syntax, just natural speech. The key was moving processing to the edge. Each device runs a lightweight model that understands context from the room it's in. Kitchen device knows \"start the timer\" means oven timer. Bedroom device knows \"too cold\" means adjust thermostat. IMPLEMENTATION: - Local wake word detection on ESP32 - Streaming audio to edge server on premises - Small LLM (3B params) running on local GPU - Device control via MQTT - Using agora for audio transport when controlling remotely The remote control part was interesting. When you're away from home, the app streams your voice commands through WebRTC to your local network, processes them on your edge server, then controls devices. Keeps everything private, no cloud dependency. Latency is around 200ms for local commands, 400ms for remote. Power consumption increased by about 15% per device but worth it for the natural interaction. Biggest surprise was how much context matters. The same command means different things in different rooms at different times. \"Turn it off\" at night in bedroom means lights. Same command in kitchen during cooking means timer. Anyone else working on conversational IoT? What's your approach to context awareness?",

The problem isn't any single component - it's the cumulative latency. Anyone cracked sub-500ms voice response on IoT devices?",

Now i've been hunting things I needed just for this, y'know gyroscope, accelerometer, the main board and all of that, but i'm missing 1 thing, the display I kid you not, i have looked everywhere and i can't find any square displays. So i need y'alls help, where could i get a good mini square screen that could be used in a vr headset? Appreciate y'all!",

It\u2019s a deep learning model trained on NASA datasets and compatible with fine-tuning for custom industrial data. Optimized for IoT edge devices (size ~10\u201320 MB), so it runs in real time without needing the cloud. Designed to detect equipment failures early and reduce unplanned downtime. I\u2019d love to get community thoughts on: Is this kind of compact edge AI valuable to OEMs and industrial players (Siemens, Caterpillar, ABB, etc.)? Does the pricing/licensing model sound realistic? Any pitfalls or considerations I might be missing? I\u2019m not here to sell\u2014just validating if this project is worth pursuing further.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an experienced pen tester in other fields, completely new to cybersecurity or just IoT curious, by the end of this talk you\u2019ll have the knowledge to hack your first device. You might be thinking - but I thought IoT was complicated, required knowledge of hardware, and expensive tools. In this talk, I\u2019m here to dispel those myths by directly showing you the methodology, tools and tactics you can use to go and hack an IoT device today (or maybe when you get home). I\u2019ll cover what IoT devices are best for beginners, what tools you need (and don\u2019t need), how to build a small toolkit for less than $100, common tactics to get a foothold into IoT devices and how to find your first vulnerability or bug.",

The most exposed is usually called the Ingest Account - it accepts connections from the Edge Gateway (or any IoT device in general). Because of that this account can (potentially) get compromised and you do not want to loose business data or your proprietary ML models as a result. That is why Ingest Account should be used only to receive data and sent it to other account (let's call it a Datalake Account). Attacker should not be able to extract data from the Datalake Account even if was able to access the Ingest Account. You should use separate Monitoring Account to check activity in all other accounts and trigger an alert if something weird is happening. The same concept here - Monitoring Account has (limited) access to the Ingest and Datalake Accounts but those accounts can not access the Monitoring Account.",

Then I realized that controls were first pneumatic and when they started to become electrical we were the only ones that understood what was being controlled so it fell under us. Similarly with the IoT happening we are the contractor in the building that is most familiar with putting physical things in the virtual world so as IoT expands more stuff is thrown at us. I didn't realize that you all on the industrial side were even further down that path until I came across this community. So I am glad that I found this community. I am almost excited to see where my trade and my career go in the next few years. So many opportunities it's almost like choice overload.\"",
