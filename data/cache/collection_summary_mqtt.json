          "content": "Hi, can you help me with these questions? 1. I have map reporting enabled and have set the precision to 50m through the web UI. However, on [meshmap.net](http://meshmap.net) my node is showing with a precision of 1,457 m and on [https://meshtastic.liamcottle.net/](https://meshtastic.liamcottle.net/) I am in the exact same position with a precision of 2km. I have set a fixed position and it looks correct on the phone app map, but on the web maps it is way off. How can I improve the precision and get my node to the right position in the maps? 2. I have my own MQTT Server (Mosquitto) that I use with Home Assistant. If I wanted to send MQTT command over Meshtastic I could presumably set the MQTT Server to mine, but presumably that would mean that the Map Reporting would stop working? 3. If I wanted to help bridge networks I could set Uplink and Downlink to enabled on channels. However the zero hop policy on the Public PSK channel presumably means that it would not be of much use to others. In effect I would have to arrange for two areas to in a shared private channel to effectively communicate with each other? Thanks!",

          "content": "I have a question for those that know. My understanding is that when you turn mqtt on for a client node, the Meshtastic mqtt server enforces a \"zero hop\" rule which prevents that client from sending/forwarding the mqtt packets received from the meshtastic mqtt servers out onto the local Mesh. I believe the mqtt traffic is only visable to the person connected to the client that has mqtt enabled. What happens when a router is enabled to connect to mqtt? Is it still subject to the same Zero hop rule? If my understanding of how mqtt is handled, please explain what I am not understanding.",

          "content": "**TL;DR:** A wrapper over `rumqttc` that gives you *compile-time safe MQTT topics, auto-deserialization, and IDE autocomplete* for parameters &amp; payloads. No more typos, no more manual parsing. Debugging MQTT topic typos sucks. You publish to `sensors/kitchen/temperature` and a week later subscribe to `sensor/kitchen/temp` \u2014 nothing works, and you waste time chasing invisible mistakes. Dynamic topics make it even worse, plus you need to manually parse and deserialize payloads everywhere. I built a wrapper over `rumqttc` that makes this type-safe at compile time. #[mqtt_topic(\"sensors/{location}/{device_id}/data\")] struct SensorTopic { location: String, device_id: u32, // extracted from topic! payload: SensorData, // auto-deserialized } // Publishing client.sensor_topic().publish(\"kitchen\", 42, &amp;data).await?; // IDE knows you need (String, u32, SensorData), autocomplete works // Subscribing let mut subscriber = client.sensor_topic().subscribe().await?; // ^ automatically subscribes to \"sensors/+/+/data\" if let Some(Ok(msg)) = subscriber.receive().await { println!(\"{} in {} sent {:?}\", msg.device_id, msg.location, msg.payload); } **Highlights:** * Compile-time validation of topics * Strongly typed parameters &amp; payloads * Auto-deserialization (JSON, bincode, msgpack, etc.) * IDE autocomplete for topic params &amp; payload fields * Zero runtime overhead (macro-generated code) * Built on `rumqttc`, so reliability &amp; performance stay the same * Each topic gets its own subscriber \u2192 no giant manual match on raw strings **Code:** [https://github.com/holovskyi/mqtt-typed-client](https://github.com/holovskyi/mqtt-typed-client) **Crate:** [https://crates.io/crates/mqtt-typed-client](https://crates.io/crates/mqtt-typed-client) **Quick backstory:** I'm 51, spent \\~10 years programming in OCaml/F# before taking a 10-year break from coding. Started learning Rust just 3-4 months ago and got so excited about the type system that I dove into building this as my first library. ChatGPT/Claude helped me get back into \"coding shape\" quickly \u2014 I used them as a senior/junior pair programmer for code reviews and explaining unfamiliar concepts, but wrote all the code myself. Been using it in production for a few months now \u2014 makes MQTT much less painful. Would love feedback, ideas, and real-world use cases! **Also curious \u2014 would the community be interested in a post about transitioning from OCaml/F# to Rust, especially the experience of getting back into programming after a long break with AI assistance?**",

          "content": "If anyone still cares :) Thanks for all the feedback in the first post (even if most of it was negative). I promise I am not polluting public airwaves. I have literally locked two nodes in an old fridge for testing. The new functionality works through a gmail account which i am accessing through API. MQTT server detectes /email &lt;recipient email&gt; &lt;subject&gt; then asks for email body. The email goes to the gmail accout and gets sent. The bot starts monitoring for any replies which if any get forwarded back to the user. I am having some issues with proper email chaining but the system is functioning and can be used for things like emergencies. Up next: an SMS gateway which is even better in case of an emergency. At least in my country emergency number officially supports SMS. Doing SMS might require a paid API or SIM card with an actual cellular plan at the server location but i am willing to swallow some SMS costs if I can ultimately get the bot working and public for all who want/need it in my area. I am also doing my best to contribute to the physical network. I will be deploying a total of 5 nodes with beefy 8dbi antennas at varying locations in Sofia Bulgaria all set up as infrastructure repeaters with constant power supply for as long as they last.",

Initially everything appeared to be working correctly but now HA reports all sensors as \"Not Provided\" and I'm not really sure what to do next. I can see that the sensors are still reporting in in MQTT explorer. I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/ywtd3g/what_makes_an_mqtt_sensor_go_unavailable/) topic but as the user points out there the docs suggest I shouldn't need to set *expire_after* or *availability_mode* as the defaults should be sufficient to keep the sensors last state as the active state until a new state is reported right? So if that is the case what gives? What do I need to do to keep the sensors last state? They still show up as entities under MQTT but with an error for each: https://imgur.com/fmxTysh Anyone familiar with MQTT wanna help a newbie out? Here is my sensors.yaml file: https://pastebin.com/U8rV52U7 and I have it called in configuration.yaml: sensors: !include sensors.yaml EDIT: Ok I think this may have been of my own doing. I tried deleting the entities under the MQTT broker and realized they weren't getting re-added with a config reload or restart. So I moved the sensor declarations back into the main file and now they have re-appeared and seem to be working again. I did some googling and it sound's like there is a current and legacy way to declare sensors and I'm doing it the legacy way (instead of using template:).",

I found [homeassistant-csgo](https://github.com/lociii/homeassistant-csgo), but the developer had marked it as deprecated and asked his users to move on to his Overwolf based integration. I do not want to install Overwolf on my PC and I also found that there was much more data available that I wanted to access, but that his integration didn't expose in Home Assistant, so I decided to build my own. Enter **cs2mqtt:** This project has a completely different approach, which is to accept data from the [Counter-Strike Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration) engine on a high performance API and asynchronously re-transmit the data as MQTT messages on seperate topics and use the [MQTT discovery protocol](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) to automatically create MQTT devices in Home Assistant, for every connected STEAM account. **cs2mqtt** is designed to run as docker container and can be hosted on your gaming PC, a separate server such as a Raspberry Pi or just on the same hardware as your Home Assistant server. The container only uses about 70MB RAM and in my benchmarks, on my own server, with simulated data from Counter-Strike, it can handle over 10000 requests per seconds. I have been using it myself for over a year now and I'm very happy with, so I decided to share it here with you guys. You can find the code and docs over at [https://github.com/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt](https://github.com/lupusbytes/cs2mqtt)",

          "title": "Why you should care about Bambu Labs removing third-party printer access, and what you can do about it",
          "content": "Many of you will already be aware of [Bambu Labs' recent announcement](https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/). tl;dr: A firmware update scheduled for January 23rd will remove the ability of third-party software such as Orca Slicer or the Panda Touch to connect directly to your printer. Users of third-party slicers will have to export sliced files and load them in a new \"Bambu Connect\" app in order to start prints or manage the printer. # Why you should care Open-source collaboration has driven the rapid advancement of 3D printing, enabling companies like Bambu Lab to produce reliable, consumer-grade printers. While Bambu Lab has taken a more closed approach than other manufacturers, they\u2019ve supported third-party integrations and open access in meaningful ways, such as their work on Bambu Studio, a PrusaSlicer fork, and MQTT endpoints for monitoring. However, their decision to block third-party software access to their printers via a firmware update is a stark departure from this collaborative spirit. This change threatens the fundamental freedoms of hobbyists and professionals who depend on interoperability and flexibility. From here it's a small step to making the firmware mandatory and prohibiting downgrades, after which Bambu Lab gets a veto over anything you want to do with **your** printer. The workaround provided, Bambu Connect, adds additional overhead and difficulty to the process of printing for anyone not using Bambu Studio, is closed-source, and is not even feature complete: Linux support is \"Under Development\", so anyone using Orca Slicer on Linux is simply out of luck for now. Video streaming is also not yet supported, so anyone using a third-party slicer can no longer benefit from one of the major features of their printer. In short, this change has absolutely no benefit for end-users. It's anti-consumer and represents a reduction of functionality in your printer. Further, it sets the stage for further changes that limit how you may use your printer, such as enforcing model licensing restrictions on-device and preventing third-party development of labor-saving enhancements such as the Panda Touch. # What you can do about it The Internet's history is littered with events like this, where a company attempts to roll-back the functionality of their devices in service to their own goals and counter to their customers' wishes. In many of these cases, consumer outcry and concrete action such as those outlined below have convinced these companies that remaining open for innovation is the better pathway. 1. Don't update your printer's firmware: Bambu will likely be tracking download and installation counts. Make it clear you won't run this firmware. 2. Contact Bambu Lab: Politely express your concerns using their [support portal](https://bambulab.com/en/my/support/general-inquiry). Make it clear that you value open access and will not accept this change. 3. Vote with Your Wallet: Pause any purchases of Bambu Lab products or consumables and consider alternatives. If the change goes through, weigh selling your printer or avoiding updates. 4. Withdraw Your Support on MakerWorld: If you\u2019re a creator, remove or relocate your models to other platforms and consider cashing out exclusive points. 5. Spread the Word: Share this issue widely to ensure others are informed and can join the pushback. # Contact Bambu Lab The first thing you should do is make Bambu Lab aware that you're not willing to accept this change. [Open a support ticket here](https://bambulab.com/en/my/support/general-inquiry) and let them know - politely - that you object to this change. It's most effective if you use your own words, but if you'd rather, here's a template you can start from: &gt;I\u2019m writing to express my objection to the recently announced decision to block third-party software from accessing Bambu Lab printers. &gt;As a proud owner of the \\[model\\], I chose Bambu Lab for its quality and its openness to innovation. Restricting software access would diminish the flexibility and functionality of my printer, negatively impacting my experience as a user. &gt;Should this change proceed, I will not update my printer's firmware and will reconsider purchasing Bambu Lab products in the future. I urge you to reconsider this decision and maintain open access, which has been a hallmark of 3D printing innovation. Include as appropriate: &gt;I am also a creator on MakerWorld, with x total downloads and y boosts, having earned z points across my models, which brings significant value to the Bambu Lab ecosystem. Should this change go ahead, I intend to move all my models to other hosting services as soon as any exclusivity period is over. All my future models will be uploaded elsewhere and not mirrored to MakerWorld. \\[Furthermore, I intend to redeem my \\[x\\] exclusive points for cash and close my account.\\] \\-- &gt;I have frequently purchased your filaments for the quality and convenience they offer. However, in light of this change I will be seeking out alternative suppliers for my consumable needs. \\-- &gt;I am responsible for making purchasing decisions for my \\[school | educational institution | workplace\\], and in light of this change I will no longer be able to recommend Bambu Labs' products for our use, forcing us to seek out alternatives with your competitors. # Stop buying their stuff Voting with our pockets is an incredibly powerful tool to demonstrate that this change will not come without a cost. There are many excellent manufacturers of filament out there - stop buying Bambu's filament. Don't buy more Bambu Lab printers until they agree to cancel or roll-back this change. If this is important enough to you, commit to selling your printer if this change is pushed through, or at the point where a firmware upgrade is made mandatory or limits you from using significant new features. Unfortunately, most of us are here because Bambu Labs' printers are significantly better than the competition - but a high quality printer that can only be used in ways the manufacturer deems acceptable is as bad as no printer at all. If you've previously recommended Bambu Lab printers to others, or if you have control over purchasing decisions at a company or institution, consider finding alternatives. # Withdraw your labour Many of us are creators who publish our models to MakerWorld. MakerWorld represents a significant boon to Bambu Lab: the presence of high quality models and the close integration with Bambu Studio and Bambu Handy enhances the usefulness of their printers, and the draw of simple click-to-print functionality acts as a significant incentive to people to choose to buy their hardware. Withdrawing your models from MakerWorld and uploading them elsewhere is a significant loss to Bambu Lab and the attractiveness of MakerWorld and thus their hardware. If you have exclusive points, cashing them out for money rather than using them on vouchers imposes a meaningful financial cost on them as well. If enough makers credibly commit to doing this, the pressure alone will have a significant impact on their calculations when considering if they should go ahead with this change. If you're a maker and have models you're willing to withdraw, I'd encourage you to commit to doing so in your letter to Bambu Lab and in a comment below. Bear in mind that if you have models under the Exclusive program, you will need to wait 90 days since launch (or 14, in case of the launch exclusive option) before you can remove them and post them elsewhere. Finally, rather than deleting your listing, you may choose to remove the models and update the description to include a message explaining why you have taken them down, as well as linking your users to where they can now be found. # Spread the word Let others know that this is a fight worth having, and make them aware of the consequences of letting Bambu Lab limit what we can do with the printers we bought and own. Feel free to link to this post, or write your own explanation. Encourage others to take the actions outlined here. This isn't the first, tenth, or even hundredth time a company has tried to close their hardware like this. With sufficient pushback, and by demonstrating credibly that this will cost Bambu Lab customers, we can succeed in demonstrating that the costs of being closed are not worth whatever benefits they hope to derive by limiting their customers' options.",

The new v1.4.0 update will include the MQTT Say command to be able to let Billy announce messages from Home Assistant (or any other custom Mqtt broker). Both literal messages, where Billy will repeat the sentence word for word, as well as prompt messages, where Billy will give his own twist on it based on his personality. This will open up a bunch of new possibilities where Billy can announce something \u2018on his own\u2019 (HA automations) without the need of someone pressing the physical button first. In the coming days I\u2019ll continue to finalise this feature but in the meantime you could already check out the beta version on the Dev branch on Github: https://github.com/Thokoop/billy-b-assistant/tree/dev There you can also find the build instructions if you\u2019d like to build one yourself.

          "title": "MQTT as primary API for web app (instead of REST)",
          "content": "At my company, we decided to use MQTT instead of REST for the API behind our web application (Blazor server). It wasn't my decision - in fact, I didn't like the idea from the beginning - but I went along with it. After working with it for a while, I'm convinced it was the wrong choice. I've basically had to reimplement the ASP.NET Core pipeline for MQTT - request/response, routing, validation, authentication, middleware, filters, etc. Developer experience has been rough. With ASP.NET REST you get all of this for free thanks to years of ecosystem maturity, but with MQTT you're reinventing the wheel at every step. I understand MQTT is great for IoT. But for a standard web app, I don't see any real use case for it. Tooling is weaker (no Swagger, no Postman, fewer testing frameworks), onboarding new devs will be harder I guess. So we've created technical debt by rolling our own \"mini ASP.NET pipeline\", right? The project is only about a year old, greenfield, and not very active. That makes me think rewriting wouldn't be that hard - the endpoint handlers themselves wouldn't change much and could probably stay more or less the same. When I raise concerns internally, my colleagues don't see a problem. I'd like to know if I'm missing something, or if I should push harder for a rewrite to REST. So I'm curious: - Has anyone here actually made MQTT work well as a primary API layer for a web app? - If so, what patterns or tooling did you use to avoid re-inventing everything? - Would you recommend sticking with MQTT or moving toward REST? EDIT: Additional context: - The reason we're building this app is that the existing one relies on technologies that are end-of-life, and our customers require supported platforms. Since we are .NET developers, Blazor was chosen - both to modernize and to test if Blazor is a good fit for us. - This app is part of a larger suite where MQTT actually does make sense - we also work with IoT. That's probably the root of the idea to \"use MQTT\", but the message seems to have been miscommunicated and the decision was made to apply MQTT everywhere. What I still don't understand is why, after a year, there's no recognition that MQTT makes little sense as the API layer for a web application. - We really don't do anything fancy - just a simple web app. I can imagine that if we later decide to extend the app, both MQTT and REST could coexist, right? But I think it will not happen.",

          "content": "Hey Folks! I just want to share this awesome project. You can build your own own Apple HomeKey with an ESP32, a PN532 NFC Module V3 as just a tiny bit of sodering. This was my first sodering project ever. I\u2019d just followed [this](https://github.com/rednblkx/HomeKey-ESP32) instructions. The only difference I made was, that I used the ESP online tool instead of installing it on my Mac. And now, i have my own HomeKey to trigger everything, not only Locks. Because you can add this device via MQTT to Home Assistant, you can trigger whatever you want :) So big shout out to [rednblkx](https://github.com/rednblkx) for this cool reverse engineered HomeKey!",

          "content": "I'm planning a communication system within a closed room (variable but should work up to 10x10m) filled with shelves, connecting up to 10\u201340 nodes distributed over the shelves to a central processing unit, would CAN or MQTT be the better choice? (The system will have to be CE-certified). Key details and criteria are: 1. Environment and Layout: * The room has minimal external interference or noise sources. * The nodes sit in the shelves and need to transmit simple sensor data only when a state changes. * To ensure full coverage, the total cable length for CAN could reach up to 80m, given a potential serpentine cable routing cable layout. 2. Reliability and Security: * The system must be reliable for transmitting data without loss. When a change occurs it has to be received by the central processing unit in under 1 second, losses would be fatal. * Security against hacking or tampering is crucial. 3. Modularity and Scalability: * Nodes must be modular, with connectors allowing easy plugging and unplugging. The cables would run in the floor with sockets for plugging in nodes, if there is a shelve at the respective location. The layout of the shelves and therefore nodes might change sometimes, but not too often (like 1-2 times a year). * The system will be used in rooms of different size from 3x6m to 10x10m. But all rooms should run with the same system. 4. My thoughts: * CAN comes with higher hardware and cabling complexity, potentially reducing modularity. * MQTT is more flexible and easier to set up but may require WiFi networking, leading to higher power consumption, increased security concerns, and possibly more expensive CE certification. Given these factors, which protocol would be more suitable for this setup, and what are the trade-offs to consider in terms of implementation complexity, scalability, reliability, and security?",

Each Python app is responsible for one Database. Different databases is for different device groups. Problem: Even though all Python apps are subscribe with clean session False (Persistence) I have seen more than twice data being lost due to multiple reasons. Server goes down and Python service did not start up. Or Broker goes down and all subscriptions are lost. All of the above causes data loss. Solution: I have found EMQX Broker has a database connector and you basically bind a topic into the database and everything published there is stored into the database. Which is exactly what I want. I tried that with SQL Server and MongoDB. Both worked. From what I understand I will need to do a buffering into a database. Then my services will read that database and parse and move the data into SQL Server databases. I think using SQL Server for that is not a good solution cause I only need is a FIFO operation. Question: What is the best database for FIFO operations?",

          "content": "Hey r/homeassistant community, I've been tinkering with ways to pull real-time data from my Tesla (like battery level, charging state, odometer, and location) and feed it into Home Assistant for better automation and monitoring. With some help from Grok (the AI from xAI), I put together a two-part guide on setting this up using a Raspberry Pi and the Tesla Fleet API. It's straightforward, cost-effective, and leverages MQTT for seamless HA integration. \\*\\*Part 1: Environment Setup\\*\\* This covers the basics to get your Pi ready: \\- Grabbing a domain and pointing it to your Pi (handles dynamic IPs too). \\- Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy. \\- Configuring FastAPI for handling Tesla's OAuth callbacks. \\- Securing everything with free SSL certs from Let's Encrypt. \\- Registering on the Tesla Developer Portal and generating keys. Grok was a game-changer here \u2013 it provided exact commands, configs, and troubleshooting tips tailored to my setup. No more endless Googling! \\[Read Part 1 here\\](https://homatica.cc/blog/raspberry-pi-tesla-logging-part-1) \\*\\*Part 2: Implementing the Logging Script\\*\\* Building on Part 1, this dives into the \\`tesla\\_mqtt\\_logger.py\\` script: \\- Managing access tokens and refreshing them automatically. \\- Waking your Tesla if it's asleep and polling data every 15 minutes. \\- Outputting data to MQTT topics (perfect for HA sensors/entities) or CSV if you prefer local logging. \\- Running it as a systemd service for reliability. Again, Grok helped craft the script, handle edge cases like API errors, and optimize for Pi hardware. The MQTT output means you can easily create custom dashboards or automations in Home Assistant \u2013 think notifications for low battery or geofencing triggers. \\[Read Part 2 here\\](https://homatica.cc/blog/grok-raspberry-pi-tesla-logging-part-2) If you're into EVs, home automation, or just Raspberry Pi projects, check these out! I'd love feedback, questions, or if anyone has tweaks for better HA integration. Has anyone else logged Tesla data this way? Thanks! \ud83d\ude80",

I've followed the official mqtt plugin guide but it's not very comprehensive. First I configured a Host: https://preview.redd.it/vzlh4ludr0ef1.png?width=1538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed968c9baf8183ca5309b06687164032a94c5968 Then I went ahead and configured a device under it named : \"devices\" that represents the \"devices\" topic: https://preview.redd.it/56drwjxhr0ef1.png?width=1582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bb9aa86456d7acc6cc24e52a77689705ae9e12e Here's the configuration I added to the zabbix\\_agent2.conf file in accordance with the official mqtt plugin docs: \"Plugins.MQTT.Timeout=5 Plugins.MQTT.Sessions.railway\\_broker.Url=tcp://localhost:1883 Plugins.MQTT.Sessions.railway\\_broker.Topic=devices/ Plugins.MQTT.Sessions.railway\\_broker.User=ctv Plugins.MQTT.Sessions.railway\\_broker.Password=xxx\" Unfortunately, there's no indication from the agent nor the broker logs of any interaction between the two. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

When I experimented with this using the Canadian server ([mqtt.mt.gt](http://mqtt.mt.gt/) in place of the default one, I was able to weed out the flood of USA based notes and chatter, which is great. But the part about filtering by province and beyond doesn't seem to have the same effect. * If in Canada change the MQTT root topic from default msh/US to msh/CA/ {your province} eg: msh/CA/BC. Case sensitive. I set my radio to **msh/CA/NS** but I still get all of Canada, which increased my node count from 35 to 350. **Is that setting supposed to filter BOTH the nodes AND the chatter from outside the selected region?** **Can I include multiple regions by combining them like emails. e.g. msh/CA/NS ; msh/CA/NB** **Is there a list of valid regions beyond the provinces and their standard codes. e.g. Counties, Halifax, Hants** (I had to split my questions into separate posts, because the Reddit Bot removed it for some reason)",

My laptop finds it and I can run either Meshsense or the web client (but not both at the same time) and both of those work no problem. I usually leave Meshsense running and it cooks along fine. What I'd like to also be able to do is have that node uplink locations so the neighborhood shows up on meshmap.net. My pocket node does that through my phone but I'm not always around and nodes drop off. I've been messing with the settings and the G2 does all the business when connected to my phone via Bluetooth so I suspect there's some firewall setting in my router that I need to change but I'm not at all versed in that stuff.

          "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m stuck with an integration issue between **Zigbee2MQTT** and **Home Assistant**. **Context:** * Zigbee2MQTT 2.6.1 with Sonoff coordinator (EZSP 7.4.5). * 87 devices paired, all visible and working fine in Z2M. * MQTT broker: core-mosquitto (HA add-on). * Home Assistant MQTT integration enabled with discovery. **Problem:** * In Zigbee2MQTT, all devices respond correctly (ON/OFF, status, etc.). * In Home Assistant, many entities show:*This entity is no longer being provided by the mqtt integration. If the entity is no longer in use, delete it in settings.* * These entities stay \u201cdead\u201d in HA dashboards, even though Z2M still controls them fine. **What I tried so far:** * Verified `homeassistant: enabled: true` in Z2M config. * Published `homeassistant/status \u2192 online` to MQTT to trigger discovery. * Listened to `homeassistant/#` \u2192 not seeing device `config` messages. * Tried both `force_disable_retain: true/false`. * Restarted HA + Z2M + Mosquitto multiple times. * Devices are present in Z2M frontend, but not re-discovered in HA. **So basically:** Z2M is pushing fine to MQTT, but HA doesn\u2019t re-adopt the entities. \ud83d\udc49 Has anyone fixed this issue where **devices are alive in Z2M but orphaned in Home Assistant**? * Do I need to purge retained MQTT topics under `homeassistant/#`? * Or is this a known bug with recent HA/Z2M builds? Thanks a lot \ud83d\ude4f",

          "content": "Hi Meshtastic people, I'm trying to understand how network works but currently few things are not very clear to me. I want to create a Meshtastic-first service in my area, where people can connect and publish messages, and get replies (like a bot). The data they sent will be processed locally, and I already have a server for it. As far as I get it, to interface with the network I need to put a local physical node out there and somehow advertise it, maybe put stickers on a street or something, so people can find it and connect - I've read that only people with the same mesh settings can join; so for the HW I was thinking of getting a WisMesh Ethernet MQTT Gateway. Now the real question: how does MQTT play in all of this? Official Meshtastic doc mentions there's some \"Default broker\" available, does it mean that I can just connect there instead and avoid buying my local node? Does it work like TheThingsNetwork? Or MQTT is just purely for bridging Meshtastic and LAN? Edit: I'm located in the EU. Thank you!",

But it looks like the firmware is checking for **API clients** (like Home Assistant via ESPHome API) instead of MQTT clients, and since it doesn\u2019t see one, it reboots itself. What I\u2019ve tried so far: * Power is solid (using PoE splitter, 5V 2A). * Board works fine until it hits the reboot timeout. * MQTT connection is stable \u2014 Nodered sees the entities. * Nothing else is crashing, only this \u201cNo clients; rebooting\u201d condition. Any guidance would be much appreciated \u2014 I just want the board to stay online with MQTT only, no API required. Thanks! EDIT: setting `reboot_timeout: 0s` under the API config (`api:`) seemed to solve the issue of rebooting. thank you u/meep185 for the support.",

I've noticed for a few days now that two nodes with T1000e have popped up, but this one (picture) is the only one using LF in the whole city! All the others are in MediumSlow mode. Now I'm wondering, what are the advantages of using such a small tracker as the T 1000 in MQTT?

So, if anyone knows, there's an ESP32 module, containing microcontroller, wi-fi chip etc. It'll send sensor data as json to MQTT broker using [this](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) library, so the json string will look like this: {\"sn\":\"A1\",\"flow\":6574,\"tds\":48,\"temp\":25,\"valve\":\"open\",\"status\":1} sn = serial number of each device. Sometimes, if a command is sent to the device from mqtt broker, device can return an information about itself, it'll append a \"debug\" key into json string, so json will end up looking like this: {\"sn\":\"A1\",\"flow\":6574,\"tds\":48,\"temp\":25,\"valve\":\"open\",\"status\":1, \"debug\":\"\\[I20\\]free heap: 10000\"} Now each device will be sending such data every 1 sec, so I need a solution that will send to queue buffer, so as to not to get overwhelmed. Imagine 50K of devices each sending every 1 sec? So I was wondering, why reinvent the wheel, when what I need - is quite common, so someone probably already has a premade library in github/whenever, so I was wondering if someone could help me here. I know C as a strong junior, and C++ as a beginner. I also know there are plenty of premade scripts for Python, but I don't know python. I'd prefer in C++ because then at least I'd be able to modify the code, and choose into which columns and tables to have the data stored.",

LongFast (default) * Each channel has its own PSK. * Using HiveMQ Cloud as the broker. * Goal is a cloud solution so an outage at my location does not take everyone down. **Problem** Messages from the Family channel rarely reach the MQTT broker. I occasionally see one arrive, but most do not. I want to confirm the required settings and what I might be missing. **What I have done** * Created the HiveMQ instance and credentials. * Configured MQTT settings on the Family channel. * Searched through forum posts and MQTT threads but did not find a fix. **What I need** A checklist of required settings and common pitfalls for getting consistent MQTT uplink/downlink on a private channel across multiple states. If there are known gotchas with channel-level MQTT toggles, topic formats, ACLs, TLS ports, client IDs, or per-node roles, please call those out. **Details you may want me to provide** * Firmware versions for each node - 2.6.11 * Exact MQTT settings (server, port, TLS, root topic, client ID, username/password) - default port, using the TLS URL * Whether nodes have Wi-Fi or phone tether for internet, and which one is the MQTT gateway - testing with Heltec, lilygo nodes via bluetooth. I have a station G2 but its is not up at the moment, it will be about 65' up on a tower and be on wifi when it goes up. * Any routing or hop settings that could affect forwarding? * Any limitations to the URL length?

          "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m an IoT major and I\u2019ve built some small projects with Flutter for the frontend and Python for backend processing (like photo processing). So far, I\u2019ve always just stored files locally (in a folder), then hard-coded the path, and let Flutter call the Python script directly. Repo (for reference): [https://github.com/Mahmoudbat/2d-cnc-printer](https://github.com/Mahmoudbat/2d-cnc-printer) But I realize this isn\u2019t how things are done in the industry. From what I understand, people use **APIs** to communicate between frontend and backend. I tried to look into APIs but I got lost \u2014 there are so many (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, MQTT, etc.). Here\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck: * Are APIs basically just a way to transfer messages, like TCP/UDP already do? * If so, why not just use TCP or UDP directly? * I see frameworks like FastAPI, Django, Flask \u2014 do they all just implement REST under the hood? * Is an \u201cAPI\u201d just a concept, while the framework decides how it\u2019s actually implemented? For context: I\u2019m joining a hackathon soon, and I need to process an image on my machine (Python) and represent it on a webpage (frontend). I\u2019d love if someone could explain in beginner-friendly terms (with maybe a small example flow) how to structure this for a real-world project. Thanks in advance!",

With LOT, the Coreflux MQTT broker has a way to use the real time data like SQL is for a DATABASE. It leaves the concept of just a data pipe \u2014 it becomes a place where you can: * Transform and aggregate data in real time * Trigger and call functions scripts and AI models directly * Document the full logic in a **LOT Notebook** Usually with integrations it becomes a problem, not having all the infomration . The concept is having everything in once place, documentation and code. You would expect that to happen with a nodeJS project, but usually that is not the case. THis instead focus on the document first and the code represents usually 30% of the document. The languague abstracts most of the code into simpler instructions, useful for data flows, transformations, shcema usages , time event triggered actions, integrations with APIS, Devices and much more \u2014 everything is in one place, executable and self-documented. Instead of drawing diagrams in Confluence and coding microservices separately, the system and the document are one thing. In this case, i am trying out the VIdeo Route. And in this demo: 1. A camera in Australia streams images into MQTT 2)LOT triggers Python running **YOLO AI** for boat detection 2. The results are published back into MQTT This approach feels more **monolithic** than the usual microservice sprawl \u2014 but it\u2019s easier to maintain, transparent, and faster to adapt.

In your opinion, what makes more sense to invest in: * building strong networking fundamentals (routing, switching, TCP/IP) * pursuing certifications like Cisco CCNA * or diving into IoT-related protocols and technologies such as MQTT, LoRaWAN, and telecom in general? I\u2019d love to hear from people already working in the field or who have recently made these choices. What\u2019s the best approach to avoid putting all my bets only on cloud?

          "content": "Built voice control for our smart home devices that actually understands context and doesn't need wake words for everything. THE PROBLEM: Traditional IoT voice control is basically shouting commands at devices. \"Alexa, turn on living room lights.\" \"OK Google, set temperature to 72.\" It's functional but nobody wants to talk to their house like that constantly. WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS: Made the devices understand conversational context. Walk into a room and say \"too bright\" and it dims. Say \"actually a bit more\" and it adjusts. No wake words, no specific command syntax, just natural speech. The key was moving processing to the edge. Each device runs a lightweight model that understands context from the room it's in. Kitchen device knows \"start the timer\" means oven timer. Bedroom device knows \"too cold\" means adjust thermostat. IMPLEMENTATION: - Local wake word detection on ESP32 - Streaming audio to edge server on premises - Small LLM (3B params) running on local GPU - Device control via MQTT - Using agora for audio transport when controlling remotely The remote control part was interesting. When you're away from home, the app streams your voice commands through WebRTC to your local network, processes them on your edge server, then controls devices. Keeps everything private, no cloud dependency. Latency is around 200ms for local commands, 400ms for remote. Power consumption increased by about 15% per device but worth it for the natural interaction. Biggest surprise was how much context matters. The same command means different things in different rooms at different times. \"Turn it off\" at night in bedroom means lights. Same command in kitchen during cooking means timer. Anyone else working on conversational IoT? What's your approach to context awareness?",

I developed a radar system utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, an ESP32 microcontroller, a servo motor, and an MQTT broker to measure and transmit distance and angle data in real-time. In this video, you can see the radar in action, with real-time visualization of the measured data. The system is able to scan an environment and communicate the results via MQTT for remote analysis. \ud83d\udd27 Technologies used: - ESP32 - MQTT - Ultrasonic sensor - Visualization Processing - Arduino IDE - Processing IDE - NODE-RED #ESP32 #Arduino #IoT #MQTT #esp32projects #ebokify",

          "content": "Hello everyone, LKM Series Electricity Meter to Modbus Protocol Gateways are designed to be used with electricity meters that communicates in IEC62056-21 or P1 Companion Standard. The meters that supports IEC62056-21 and P1 Companion Standard has read out tables that has several data such as import energy, export energy, phase voltages and currents. LKM Series Electricity Meter to Modbus Protocol Gateways automatically reads that values and maps to Modbus registers. Field devices or software systems can easily read data over Modbus RTU or Modbus TCP protocol based on device model so that energy meter reading can easily be integrated to field automation systems without need of IEC6056-21 protocol or P1 Companion Standard implementation. LKM Series 868MHz LoRaWAN Meter Reader with Electricity Meter Protocol to Modbus Protocol Gateways can read IEC62056-21 Energy Meters and convert its data to Modbus Registers so that field devices or remote applications can meter data via Modbus TCP.

Both Client and Broker modes can be configured to support different authentication and TLS encryption schemes, allowing Secomea users to tailor a secure solution to collect data from their particular MQTT scenario. \ud83c\udfac Have a look at our video where our Product Owner & Embedded Software Developer, Simon Nygaard Einfeldt, describes the feature in more detail! #remoteaccess #MQTT #OT",

It has 4 outputs with up to 16A per output and up to 40A for the whole device. It also have several safety features like Overpower and over-voltage protection of the load as well as device temperature protection. The Shelly PRO 4PM is more than suitable for automations as it is compatible with the most used home automation platforms like Home Assistant as we will see later and allows remote control and precise power management.

Question becomes integration directly into PLC or straight line into UNS. My take is integration into PLC. Now my comment about the work is the work.  If I deploy new smart sensors in my automation.  The code in the PLC and resulting UDTs get updated.  If my PLC is native MQTT the not so much a deal. If not then I\u2019m updating some type of bridge or gateway.

A topic could be used to publish the payload/transaction data along with a trigger or the trigger could be its own separate topic and the response could be read on a different topic.

It all depends on what the structure look like that you are publishing.  For example if I try to publish a complex equipment namespace with Transmission you end up with a ton of overhead in Transmission tags.  This is due to the Group/Node/Device construct.  If you have Equipment structures with deep levels of nested UDT's  Then you can generate a lot of overhead tags due to transmission wanting to turn everything in the structure into a device and then creating transmission client tags for that device.  This is where I think HB may be better for this just pulling from Ignition OPC-UA but I haven't really given it too much time.    As an Example I have one asset being published right now that generates 12000 topics and growing as we continue to semantically model it. A Typical topic looks something like this. Area/Line/Functions/Mandrel Thrust Block 1/Motion/Axis/MotorOvertemperatureFLFault.  I replaced the area and line with generic terms for obvious reasons.  At scale I dont think the centralized ignition method is the way to go. depending on complexity of data structures transmission overhead can scale out of control. This is why I have a ton of interest in the Litmus edge and Hive MQ edge brokers. HB belongs in that conversation as well. The use case of processing and modeling at the source is growing stronger in my head. I just waiting for these edge products to mature a bit more so the needed functionality is there.\"",

It was also shortly touched in the podcast Using MQTt and UNS architectures at Enterprise level Part 2. I think it is not necessarily a contradiction. It is more an architectural question if the historian/time series database is used as a source or a sink in the data flow within the UNS and which role UNS plays in terms of contextualization of the data. And sorry to be that lengthy but are there any good books out with plenty of implementation examples that put together design principles/question before you define your architecture and the semantic of your namespace?\"",
