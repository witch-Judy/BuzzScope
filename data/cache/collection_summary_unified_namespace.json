          "content": "Hi everyone, I'm having a persistent issue in our Exchange 2013/2019 coexistence environment. Users with mailboxes on the Exchange 2013 server are unable to log into OWA via the Exchange 2019 URL, resulting in an **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** error. A key detail of our environment is that the **Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2019 servers are on different network segments.** Could this be a potential issue? Do I need specific firewall rules or routing to allow the proxying to work correctly, even though all internal services and health mailboxes seem to have connectivity? I've already performed the following troubleshooting steps, and all configurations appear to be standard: * **URL &amp; DNS:** Autodiscover and all virtual directories on both servers are configured to point to the correct, unified namespace (`mail.domain.com`). * **SSL Certificates:** The SSL certificate is a wildcard cert and is correctly assigned to all services on both Exchange 2013 and Exchange 2019 servers. * **Authentication:** Both servers use the same authentication methods (Windows Authentication, Forms-Based Authentication, etc.) for OWA and ECP. * **Application Pools:** I've manually restarted the `MSExchangeMapiMailboxAppPool` and `MSExchangeRPCProxyAppPool` on the Exchange 2013 server, but the `503` errors persist. * **IIS Logs:** The IIS logs on the Exchange 2013 server show the `503` errors from the internal `HealthMailbox` accounts when trying to access the MAPI and RPC virtual directories. There are no other clear error messages. * **Event Logs:** The Windows Event Logs do not show any specific errors or crashes that correspond to the `503` timestamp. * **Services:** The `Microsoft Exchange Health Manager` and `Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication` services are confirmed to be running. It seems the Exchange 2013 server is failing to proxy the request for the Exchange 2019 mailbox. Given that all standard configurations are in place, I suspect there might be a more subtle underlying issue. Has anyone encountered this specific problem before in a similar coexistence setup, especially with servers on different network segments? Any guidance on further diagnostics or potential non-standard fixes would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! =================== edited for change the condition, i already change the primary mail also into exchange 2019 but i still cant login with user mailbox 2013",

          "title": "Nasuni vs. Azure NetApp Files: Hybrid Cloud Storage for the Enterprise",
          "content": "NetApp is undeniably one of the preeminent brands in storage. Yet what enterprises expect from a storage solution has changed profoundly in the era of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. A recognizable brand is not enough. Today, a storage solution must deliver unlimited scale in every dimension, fast performance at all sites, efficient collaboration between those locations, rapid recovery from ransomware attacks, and more. [The Nasuni File Data Platform and Azure NetApp Files (ANF) both leverage the cloud, but they do so in very different ways.](https://www.nasuni.com/blog/nasuni-vs-azure-netapp-files-hybrid-cloud-storage-for-the-enterprise/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic-social) Nasuni relies on unlimited, cost-effective cloud object storage, while Azure NetApp Files uses block-based storage arrays hosted in Azure. This important technical difference leads to **two distinct solutions with differing capabilities.** **Here are 12 ways to** [**compare Nasuni and Azure NetApp Files**](https://www.nasuni.com/nasuni-vs-netapp/)**.** # 1. Technology Azure NetApp Files is a fully managed, highly available Microsoft service designed for high-performance, low-latency workloads. The solution is built on NetApp\u2019s bare metal, with NetApp All-Flash FAS arrays (AFF) powered by the ONTAP storage operating system hosted in Azure datacenters. That is a mouthful, but the technology works very well for SAP HANA and Oracle applications that require advanced data management capabilities, enterprise web apps, and other workloads that are I/O-intensive but lower in terms of overall capacity. Yet this block-based architecture is fundamentally different from a cloud-native model and introduces cost and scalability challenges as environments grow. This sensitivity to scale is one of the reasons the Nasuni File Data Platform is often recommended as a better choice for enterprise customers. Nasuni\u2019s cloud-native file system resides fully in object storage from Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or on-premise providers. Lightweight Nasuni Edge Appliances deployed in cloud regions or on-prem locations cache only active data locally to deliver LAN-speed access. Nasuni\u2019s object-first approach allows for seamless file share scalability through a single, unified instance, and makes it possible for the Nasuni platform to deliver a long list of additional capabilities in addition to the functions of a traditional storage solution. # 2. Scale There is no need to define a maximum volume size at creation with Nasuni. Storage growth is elastic, and capacity is only limited by the backend cloud object storage and billing/account limits. There is no maximum file share capacity. No hard limit on file sizes. And you can easily add capacity on-demand. In recent years, Azure NetApp Files (ANF) has been increasing its volume and file count limits, but resource limits remain. When those limits are reached, you need to create additional volumes, which in turn forces you to make decisions on how to divide data across these silos. Each of these volumes then requires its own administration console. A large global enterprise is therefore forced to continue working with silos of file data instead of a single unified global file system. # 3. Locations Scale is about more than expanding the total volume of data stored. A hybrid cloud storage solution should scale efficiently in every dimension, including the number of locations served and the number of users who can access the file share. Nasuni supports scalable deployment across any number of customer locations, with each Edge Appliance capable of supporting thousands of users accessing the same global file system. The caching Edge Appliances provide fast access to file data for local users, but each one syncs with the global file system, maintaining a single, unified namespace. With ANF, your file data is locked into a single Azure region. Cross-region replication can be created for disaster recovery (DR) purposes, but you won\u2019t be able to collaborate between the two volumes. Cross-region replication can double costs and does not support multi-site write use cases. We\u2019ve found that this multi-site capability is essential for large companies or enterprises that facilitate collaboration between distant locations or need to support follow-the-sun collaborative workflows. # 4. Global Locking One of the first things we learned in deploying a global file sharing and collaboration solution was the importance of file locking. Version conflicts halt productivity. The Nasuni Global File Lock: * Works across all Nasuni Edge Appliances (NEAs) accessing the same volume * Ensures only one user \u2013 anywhere in the world \u2013 can modify a file at a time * Orchestrates global file locking through the cloud, requiring no additional server purchases or administrative oversight Azure NetApp Files doesn\u2019t coordinate locks across sites. It doesn\u2019t support multi-site write collaboration. ANF also has no mechanism to prevent version conflicts. ANF supports file-level locking at the protocol level (SMB/NFS). This is only local locking per volume, not global locking across multiple regions or instances. As a result, it\u2019s not suited for a global, collaborative organization. # 5. Global Acceleration When files are updated, they need to be made quickly accessible across distributed teams. Azure NetApp Files offers no built-in global acceleration or edge caching, which means latency and sync delays can impact collaboration. One major lesson we learned in working with some of the largest and most collaboration-driven organizations in the world is that the latest versions of files need to be available immediately. We developed Nasuni Global File Acceleration for exactly that purpose. The tool monitors file system audit logs, effectively learning which Nasuni Edges in which locations should receive new files first. This accelerates data propagation by up to 20X, ensuring distributed teams always have access to the most up-to-date content. # 6. Multi-Cloud Azure NetApp Files is \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 exclusive to Azure. This in itself is not a problem, as Microsoft Azure is a fantastic cloud provider. Nasuni, however, supports multi-cloud flexibility across Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and even on-prem object stores like NetApp StorageGRID or Dell ECS. Many of our customers choose Azure as their sole or primary cloud object storage backend. Yet many of them also want the freedom to rely on multiple clouds for economics, performance, regional availability, and data residency requirements. A single Nasuni Edge Appliance can present file shares from multiple clouds, enabling hybrid or multi-cloud strategies without adding any administrative burdens or fragmenting file access. # 7. Backup Azure NetApp Files has a limit on snapshots that has proven frustrating, expensive, or both for IT administrators at large companies. IT has to turn to 3rd party backup tools for long-term data protection and/or devote cycles to pruning snapshots to avoid hitting that snapshot ceiling. Nasuni stores snapshots as immutable objects on low-cost, durable cloud object storage. When our customers choose Azure Blob, they have as many as six air-gapped copies and improved RPOs and RTOs. Ultimately, our customers no longer need traditional backup solutions for their file data. They can eliminate these redundant solutions and realize major cost and time savings. # 8. Cost A simple comparison of the costs of the two solutions is difficult, as total cost of ownership is dependent on a variety of factors, including the particulars of your file data environment and business needs. Azure NetApp Files pricing is tied to performance tier (Standard, Premium, Ultra), capacity, Azure region, data egress, and snapshot usage. Costs can escalate quickly, especially when enabling cross-region replication or maintaining a hot DR instance in a second region. Nasuni pricing depends on capacity, object storage type, and optional services. The total cost of each solution depends on your organization\u2019s file data volume, number of locations, number of users, and business priorities, including ransomware preparedness. With no additional licensing needed for backup, disaster recovery, or file synchronization, and with edge caching done via software-defined VMs, customers typically reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by up to 65% compared to traditional storage stacks or ANF-like solutions. # 9. Ransomware The cloud-centric Nasuni file system functions as a pointer, so in the event of a ransomware attack, recovering files is simply a matter of redirecting the pointer to an earlier snapshot. No massive movement of data is required, so petabytes of capacity and millions of files can be restored in seconds. Additionally, Nasuni\u2019s integrated Ransomware Protection detects attack signatures at the edge, triggers automated remediation, and limits damage by restoring only affected files. With Azure NetApp Files, data must be physically moved from snapshots or 3rd party backup systems after a ransomware attack, a process that can take hours. # 10. Disaster Recovery If the primary instance in an Azure region becomes unavailable due to a disaster, an Azure NetApp Files customer will need to cut over to a second DR instance in another Azure region. This second instance must be ready on standby for such an event. This approach can work, in the sense that access is eventually restored, but maintaining this second instance with cross-region replication drives up the cost significantly. Nasuni\u2019s disaster recovery model is stateless and instantaneous. If one location or Edge Appliance fails, a new Edge can be provisioned and rehydrated either in a safe location or in the cloud within 15 minutes \u2014 no backup restores, no data movement, no extra licensing. # 11. Management IT teams work through the single-pane-of-glass Nasuni Management Console to provision, configure, monitor, and manage all components of the Nasuni File Data Platform across all locations \u2014 from snapshot policies to ransomware alerts to user access reporting \u2014without extra tools. One unified platform, one console. Managing multiple ANF volumes across regions and use cases often requires multiple consoles, especially when layering in 3^(rd)\\-party tools for backup, DR, ransomware protection, and data intelligence. # 12. Data Intelligence &amp; AI As both Nasuni and NetApp are expanding their data intelligence solutions, comparing how the two solutions meet the needs of the modern global enterprise today may change tomorrow. What will not change is the availability of file data. NetApp offers separate solutions like BlueXP Classification for data visibility, but ANF itself lacks integrated data intelligence or usage analytics. The result is siloed file data that\u2019s harder to curate for AI readiness. The unified cloud-centric architecture of Nasuni\u2019s hybrid cloud storage solution makes it easier for enterprises to manage and curate all global file data. Our data intelligence and analytics tool, Nasuni IQ, is designed to support the use of AI tools and services, as it gives organizations detailed insights into global file data usage. This enhanced data intelligence sets up organizations to get more out of the AI tools of today and tomorrow. # What\u2019s Right for You? Both the **Nasuni File Data Platform** and **Azure NetApp Files** offer hybrid cloud storage solutions, but they **differ significantly in architecture, scalability, and enterprise readiness.** If your organization is running I/O-intensive workloads like SAP HANA, databases, or legacy enterprise apps that require block storage performance in Azure, then Azure NetApp Files may be a fit. However, for general-purpose file data, ANF\u2019s scalability limitations, lack of file collaboration features, and high cost can be a barrier. For organizations looking to consolidate Windows File Servers, NetApp, or Dell Isilon SMB/NFS workloads, or support hybrid collaboration across distributed teams, Nasuni will be the optimal choice. Nasuni runs on top of scalable cloud object storage like Azure Blob, giving your organization a cost-effective, scalable, easy-to-manage solution with built-in security, rapid ransomware recovery, global file locking, and fast edge performance at all locations \u2013 all in a single unified platform. Finally, we are making it easier than ever to move to Nasuni.

          "title": "Professional UI/UX nerd, tried literally every Note app, realized Zettelkasten is bullshit, settled on Bear, here\u2019s the features I would add",
          "content": "I recently had a friend successfully convince me that I need to improve at note taking as well as get into the habit of journaling and to just write more in general. Over the past two months I have literally downloaded every note taking and document management app under the sun and legitimately tried them out for at least 20 minutes each. I have spent all my free time researching various note taking techniques and strategies, and actually committed time to trying each out in practice in my day-to-day. I have been settled into Bear for about a week now and I can very concretely say it\u2019s the best one out there. Here\u2019s why. I was really attracted to the idea of Zettelkasten when I first learned about it. I have used Workflowy a fair bit, but never have been able to spend large amounts of productive time in it. The idea from Zettelkasten that categorization of notes should be emergent from the notes themselves and not enforced at the outset through static folders was immediately appealing to me and offered a potential explanation as to why, as much as I liked the hyper-bullet approach of things like Workflowy (or Roam, Rem, Logseq etc), it just wasn\u2019t an environment I was really thriving in. **What I wanted was for the NOTE to be the first class citizen of the system, not the categories. I wanted to be able to CMD+N a fresh Note, write what needed writing, and then during and after the process of writing, using the bare minimum amount of mental effort, would I categorize, tag, and interlink the note or sections of note as it made sense to do so.** However I quickly discovered that the Zettelkasten technique, at least in it\u2019s formal definition, is an incredibly dumb and inefficient way to make note taking work for you rather than the other way around. Every single one of the productivity gurus was using Zettelkasten as this weird masturbatory Ouroboros of \u201cproductivity porn\u201d that at best was some kind of entertaining game along the lines of OCD hyper organizing your socks, and at worst was a complete black hole of their time that kept them from actually doing legitimately productive things. Try to find one Zettelkasten guru online whose \u201cMind Map\u201d is filled with anything other than inspiration on how to make a better Mind Map, I defy you. Now I know that may be controversial to some, and I am not saying that rigorous notetaking is dumb, nor is having well organized and networked notetaking dumb, merely that the formal method of Zettelkasten (Fleeting, Literature, Permanent Notes etc.) is dumb and inefficient, and that spending too much time organizing your notes is anti-productive. It may well have been a very good method for conducting academic research with the intent to publish further academic research (the sole purpose that it\u2019s creator used it for), but now I don\u2019t think it can even claim that. When I told my friend who initially recommended me to get into this (he uses Obsidian and uses it exclusively for academic research &amp; publishing), to my surprise he agreed and explained that his use of Obsidian is more like his own little universe of research documents where he does simple citation references to other notes, exactly as what would happen across academic papers. The conclusion I came to is that this idea for individual notes to be these tiny little atomic thoughts is completely wrong. If you limit yourself to only putting a single atomic concept on each note, that necessary means that the vast majority of your time is spent linking, tagging, categorizing, indexing, wiki-ing, MOC-ing, etc, rather than doing the thing that actually matters: WRITING QUALITY NOTES. **We need to get away from this idea that notes should be these bite-sized chunks of thought that are scribbled on a sticky note and through some magical indexing system somehow emergently allow us to discover ideas greater than the sum of the parts, I am entirely convinced this is a bullshit myth that has been kept alive by a particular sect of productivity cultism. It\u2019s my firm belief that it\u2019s better to think of notes instead as long form documents that have can have overarching story, structure, argumentation lines, and all of the other wonderful things that you can only get by allowing yourself more than an index card\u2019s worth of text.** Long form prose is simply the most mentally ergonomic medium for putting your thoughts to paper, and as a result notes taken in longer form are not only going to be better in quality, but you will find yourself able to spend far more of your precious time and attention span writing them. Also, if you have any desire to covert your notes into external material or communication, you can simply copy/paste your existing prose into a blog post, work proposal, email, or whatever. This realization that an environment conducive to writing long form notes as being of primary importance was what lead me to settling on Bear, one of the most minimal and simplest Note taking apps out there. It is beautiful, and distraction free, and for whatever intangible reason I have been writing literally hundreds of times more than I was previously to discovering it (including this post). There are also just a bunch of happy little nice-to-haves that Bear has. It\u2019s subscription is cheap as chips which is a welcome surprise after cancelling dozens of free trials for $10+ a month on other note taking apps. It has a really killer little Apple Watch app that includes one touch voice dictation note creation. My absolute favourite feature of Bear (on desktop) is not something I would have ever assumed at the start of this, and that is **the multi window support.** Being able to easily double click a note or CMD+click a linked note to open it in it\u2019s own window, either to make full screen for distraction free writing, or else to be able to cross reference multiple notes along with other shit on my desktop, is a completely killer feature, and one which astonishingly few other Note taking apps have support for (Evernote &amp; Notion essentially are it). And as it turns out, a simple tagging system really covers 90% of all the categorization needs you would have, and they count as being \u201cpost-note\u201d categorization, ie you can write the note first and then apply classification after by simply throwing a tag or two onto it. The concept of nested tags is also a really cool idea with strong potential, and one that is only used by one other app that I am aware of (Jot), but is marred by one frustrating little UX bug that I think limit\u2019s their use, and this leads into my first feature suggestion for Bear: ## Having the option for unified namespace across tag \u201clevels\u201d The idea of having nested tags is such a cool one because it has the potential for you to add a very precise level of categorization with a very minimal amount of effort. However in practice this isn\u2019t the case due to the fact that tags can have the same name across different \u201clevels\u201d. For example, the tag #ClientX and #Work/ClientX can both exist, and as a result, even if only #Work/ClientX exists currently, and I try to tag a note into there, if I tag it with #ClientX it will instead create that as a new top-level tag and then tag the note for that, which is frustrating. If you wanted it down a potentially long chain of tags you would have to type each one out followed by a slash, which ends up kind of defeating the purpose IMO. I would love to see a simple switch in settings that changes this into having a tag name only be able to exist at one time, ANYWHERE within the tag heirarchy, and then calling that tag automatically places it there, even if it is very \"deep\" down a tree of subtags would be killer and would lead to people starting to do some really cool things with this feature. Obviously this would break a lot of people's setups if it was enforced globally hence the optionality. The next suggestions pertain to the linking abilities that I think would be great to add to Bear, and in keeping with my previous revelations about workflow, they are analogs of the types of interlinking that have existed for decades within academic literature. ## Quote Citation Be able to block quote a selection of one note inside another note (either as a text snapshot of it\u2019s state at the time or quotation or else as a live version that would update as the note it\u2019s quoting updates) along with a link to that note so you can quickly open the note in another window to see the original context. Having the ability to also edit the quoted note in-line within the note that is quoting it would be ideal, but the multi-window support of Bear means that this is less of a requirement as it\u2019s just a single CMD+click away from opening in it\u2019s own little note window. Referencing an arbitrary *selection* of text from a note is I believe novel, where all other apps to my knowledge only can reference blocks of text, I am not sure if there are technical reasons why this would be very difficult (possible to reference a specific range of text in markdown?) but again, this is merely replicating something that is standardized in legacy research. The UI for doing this In-line I imagine would be something like: \u201c((\u201c + start typing name of note to quote, Enter once note selected. **This block quotes the entirety of the selected note in the active note.** \u201c(((\u201c + start typing name of note to quote, Enter once note selected. Hitting enter opens up the note in a new window, with its entire text selected, user can alter the selection to any range of text they want, and then hit Enter. This closes the quotation window and inputs **the selected text as a block quote along with a link to the selection in the original note.** ## Reference Citation This would be the same as the current [[]] link feature, but with the ability to have the text for the hyperlink be able to be arbitrary text, as well as the ability to reference select ranges of text from a note. ## In-line Note Creation A really killer little feature that is really only well executed with Rem notes currently is the ability to automatically create a new note when you are either embedding/quoting with (()) or referencing with [[]], in an analogous way to how tagging a note with a tag that doesn\u2019t yet exist creates that tag automatically. For example, let\u2019s say you have some kind of wiki page for a particular client, and you want to have some meeting notes for a client be indexed in that wiki. Rather than writing the notes first and then manually adding them into the wiki, you start at the wiki, type \u201c[[\u201c + \u201cTodays_Date Meeting Notes with ClientX\u201d and hit enter. This simultaneously creates a new note with this name and creates a link within the wiki that references that note. ## Switchable \u201cBibliography &amp; Citations\u201d section for notes Just having a toggleable section at the bottom of notes to see a full list of outgoing and incoming references would also be a nice to have to go along with the other academic-esque referencing features. I am not a fan of how this is done within existing apps because you can't switch it off for a more minimalist experience when you don't need the info. To go along with the ability to have quotes and references for select ranges of text: ## Tagging specific selections of text within a note In the same way that only a single selection of text from one note will be relevant enough to another note for a quotation, there are a great many instances in which only a single selection of text from a note belongs under the categorization of a tag. How the markdown would work for this I am not sure, but it would simply require some kind of bracket system along with a tag to represent that the tag only refers to a range of text within a note and not the note globally. This would also translate into a tweak for the Note List pane to only display this selection when its tag is selected. ## On the subject of the Note List pane\u2026 \u2026this is a part of the UI for Note apps that I think is (mistakenly) ignored and not taken seriously. I would argue this is actually one of the most important pieces of UI. [In this regard I think that Standard Notes is the only one that has really nailed the look &amp; info of the Note card. ](https://i.imgur.com/YTQZU6v.png) Name of Note, preview of note text, Date &amp; Time of creation (if sort is creation date, otherwise date and time of last edit) and all tags. I think this is the gold standard for Note List view. Also having some customization for size of these cards, being able to show more preview text would be desirable. This would be quite a big ask but having the ability to switch from list to gallery would be awesome, I\u2019m actually a big fan of Evernote\u2019s gallery view (coupled with the ability to doubleclick to open each note in it\u2019s own window). Also, I think that extending the Today filter on the Note List pane to allow for some way of flipping back through arbitrary dates analogous to flipping through a journal would also be killer, this is also something that is gaining popularity across the Roam-esque note apps and for good reason, chronological sort of writing just seems to be one of those things that our brains really like. The only other thing that I think would be cool to add as a UI tweak to the Note List pane would be for all of the Todos to be actually \u201ccheckable\u201d from within the Note List pane, and for you to also be able to click through to the note that each ToDo originated from. --- I don\u2019t know if the devs would consider these changes big or small, in my mind they are pretty small, they don\u2019t go against the minimalist spirit of Bear, and they would turn Bear into the Final Evolutionary Product of Note Taking. This was a lot of writing for an evening though and I\u2019m going to bed, curious to hear what thoughts the rest of the community have about this whole spiel.",

In this demo, Magnus McCune will showcase how a smart car manufacturer leverages UNS to digitize their plants that use protocols like OPC UA and Modbus to connect equipment and how the manufacturer used UNS to standardize data flow across multiple sites. Watch as data moves from producers through HiveMQ Edge, into a centralized cloud broker, and is published to a data lake or other destinations for further use. In the second half of the demo, you\u2019ll be introduced to the UNS topic structure, which reflects the organization\u2019s structure. See it in action with the UNS Explore, an ISO 95 style representation of a Unified Namespace. Finally, discover the UNS Bot, an AI-powered tool that allows you to query the Unified Namespace interactively and get a chatbot response. Time Stamps: 0:00 Introduction 0:",

Welcome back to our channel. Today, we're diving into a critical question: When are you ready for an MES? If you've been hearing about Manufacturing Execution Systems and wondering if your operations are ready, this video is for you. \ud83c\udfed \ud83d\udd0d Let's break down the key signs that indicate your facility is ready for MES, the benefits you can expect, and what you need to prepare before taking the plunge. Let's get started! \ud83d\udcaa \ud83d\udd11 First, let's talk about why readiness matters. MES isn't just a plug-and-play software. It's a digital transformation tool that fundamentally changes how your operations work. If you're not ready, you risk investing in a system that doesn't deliver value or, worse, creates more headaches than solutions. \ud83d\udeab \ud83d\udd0d So, how do you know when you're ready?

          "content": "Dave sets up a pilot solution for a company with multiple chemical plants to remotely monitor tank status. Situation: * Multiple chemical plants * Monitor multiple tanks with a simple SCADA at a single corporate location * Also view data in a dashboard How the solution works: * Edge node publishes to the Unified Namespace using a MQTT broker * Data organized into a Unified Namespace * SCADA (Ignition) subscribes as a node to the Unified Namespace to display the data * Historian subscribes as a node to the Unified Namespace to historize the data This solution, like our other videos, uses open technologies, and principles to enable flexible and scalable solutions for the future. These kinds of solutions can be created by applying the following principles: * Report by exception * Edge driven * Lightweight * Open technologies Chapters ------------------------------------------- 0:00- Intro 0:20- Thoughts on the recent launch event 1:20- Monitoring Chemical Plant Tanks",
